Therapeutics and Vaccines,"An emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367-606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients' lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to DPP4 receptor and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. These findings indicate that this truncated RBD protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.","A novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified as a pathogen causing a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease in the Middle East and Europe in 2012 [1] . As of October 14, 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been informed of 138 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 60 deaths (a case fatality rate of 45%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 2013_10_14/en/). Recent reports of family clusters and health care-associated transmission of MERS-CoV through close contact have proven its capacity for human-to-human transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although its transmissibility is significantly lower than that of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6] [7] [8] [9] , it may gain increased human-to-human transmissibility during its further evolution and potentially cause a pandemic in the future [10] . Accordingly, development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is critical for early intervention and prevention.

Unlike SARS-CoV, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor for binding to ACE2-expressing cells [11] , MERS-CoV utilizes a different receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for binding to DPP4-expressing cells [12] . Like the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, the S protein of MERS-CoV also plays important roles in virus entry and infection [13] . MERS-CoV S protein contains a S1 subunit that mediates virus binding to cells expressing DPP4 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) region and an S2 subunit that mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [12, 13] . Based on sequence alignment and homology modeling analysis and functional studies, we and Mou et al. have predicted that the RBD is located in residues 377-662 or 358-588 of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [14] [15] [16] (Fig. 1A) . Cocrystallographic analyses of the RBD/DPP4 complexes have confirmed that the RBD is attributed to residues 367-606 or 367-588 in MERS-CoV S1 [17] [18] [19] (Fig. 1A) .

Previous studies have shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV infection [20] and is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies protecting against SARS-CoV infection [20] . It is thus expected that the RBD of MERS-CoV, which belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV [21, 22] , may also be effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection and inducing neutralizing antibody responses against infection of MERS-CoV in vaccinated animals.

Indeed, our identified RBD (a 286-amino acid fragment spanning residues 377-662) could bind to DPP4 and induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized mice [15] , while the RBD reported by Mou et al. (a 231-amino acid fragment spanning residues 358-588) could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the 40 mg/ml level and elicit effective neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits [16] . These results suggest that the overlapping region (residues 377-588) must contain the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the major neutralizing epitope of the RBD. Crystallographic analyses indicated that the RBM is located in the middle (residues 484-567) of the RBD [18, 19] . Therefore, we designed a 212-amino acid truncated RBD sequence (residues 377-588) (Fig. 1A) and tested its ability to inhibit MERS-CoV infection and induce neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice in order to identify a relatively optimized RBD sequence for developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.

Characterization of recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc

We and Mou et al. have shown that the recombinant protein containing residues 377-662 or 358-588 of MERS-CoV S1 and human IgG Fc fragment can induce neutralizing antibody responses in immunized mice or rabbits [15, 16] . We thus believe that a truncated RBD sequence spanning residues 377-588, which includes RBM (residues 484-567) [18, 19] , may contain the major neutralizing epitope in RBD. Therefore, we expressed a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 fused with human IgG-Fc (S377-588-Fc) (Fig. 1A) . We found that this protein could be highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells and purified to high purity. Its molecular weight under the non-boiled condition was almost 1-fold greater than that under boiled condition in 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that S377-588-Fc formed a stable, dimeric structure under reducing condition.

Cross-linker analysis was then applied to characterize the conformational structure of expressed S377-588-Fc. We found that the molecular weights of the cross-linked S377-588-Fc samples were almost 1-and 3-fold higher than the samples without crosslinking (Fig. 1C) , which indicates that MERS-CoV S377-588 fused with Fc tag was able to form dimeric or tetrameric conformational structures. The bands of S377-588-Fc fusion protein in SDS-PAGE were further confirmed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against S1 of MERS-CoV ( Fig. 1B-C) .

To detect the interaction between S377-588-Fc protein and DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, we first performed a coimmunoprecipitation analysis by mixing equal concentrations of purified S377-588-Fc with soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) in the presence of Protein A Sepharose beads. Next, we analyzed the bound proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibodies specific for DPP4 and MERS-CoV S1 proteins, respectively. In SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A, left) , two clear bands respectively corresponding to the size of sDPP4 and S377-588-Fc monomer were shown in the samples co-immunoprecipitated with these two proteins, while only one band corresponding to the size of sDPP4 or S377-588-Fc was indicated in the control sample containing only sDPP4 or S377-588-Fc, respectively. The bands were confirmed by antibodies against DPP4 or MERS-CoV S1, as shown in Western and WB (right) analysis using a S1-specific polyclonal antibody. (C) Analysis of S377-588-Fc protein conformation by cross-linker. Samples were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (with cross-linker at the final concentration of 4 mM) or without cross-linker (w/o cross-linker), followed by SDS-PAGE (left) and WB (right) analysis as described above. The protein molecular weight marker (kDa) (Invitrogen) is indicated on the left. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081587.g001 blot ( Fig. 2A, right) , suggesting the significant binding of S377-588-Fc with sDPP4.

We next detected the interaction between S377-588-Fc protein and cellular DPP4 receptor on DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells using approaches similar to those described above, but replacing sDPP4 with Huh-7 cell lysates, as we previously described [15] . As expected, two clear bands (corresponding to the size of DPP4 and S377-588-Fc, respectively) were detected from the Protein A beads pre-incubated with the mixture of S377-588-Fc and Huh-7 cell lysates, which reacted strongly with a polyclonal antibody against MERS-CoV S1 and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to DPP4 (Fig. 2B) . These results indicated that S377-588-Fc of MERS-CoV was able to bind efficiently to the cell-surface receptor DPP4.

Subsequently, we further detected the binding of S377-588-Fc to sDPP4 by ELISA and cell-associated DPP4 by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2C , S377-588-Fc bound sDPP4 that was coated on the ELISA plate in a dose-dependent manner. The flow cytometric analysis also indicated a dose-dependent binding of this protein with DPP4 on DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2D) . However, the control protein hIgG-Fc did not show significant binding to sDPP4 or cell-associated DPP4 (Fig. 2C-D) . These results confirmed the binding specificity of S377-588-Fc to DPP4.

To evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of S377-588-Fc protein against MERS-CoV infection, the highly permissive human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells that express DPP4 [23] were incubated with MERS-CoV/EMC-2012 at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the presence of serially diluted S377-588-Fc protein. The viral replication, as indicated by cytopathic effect (CPE) formation, was determined at 24 h post-infection. As shown in Figure 3 , S377-588-Fc significantly inhibited MERS-CoV infection in Calu-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by diminished or reduced CPE formation. Specifically, S377-588-Fc at the concentrations of 25 and 12.5 mg/ml could completely, or nearly completely, block CPE formation, respectively, while this protein at 3.2 mg/ml could maintain $ 50% inhibition of CPE formation. However, the control hIgG-Fc protein at 25 mg/ml, or even higher (data not shown), exhibited no inhibition of CPE formation. These results suggest that recombinant S377-588-Fc protein has the potential to be further developed as a therapeutic against MERS-CoV infection. To evaluate the ability of S377-588-Fc protein to elicit MERS-CoV S-specific antibody responses, we immunized mice subcutaneously (s.c.) using the purified protein in the presence of Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant and detected IgG antibody response, subtypes and neutralizing antibodies in the mouse sera collected at different time points after immunization. The results demonstrated that S377-588-Fc induced increasing IgG antibody responses after each boost, reaching the highest level at day 10 post-3 rd vaccination, with the endpoint titer of IgG approaching 1:1.7610 5 67.7610 4 (Fig. 4A-B) . The antibodies in the mouse sera could bind efficiently to both S-RBD fusion protein S377-588-Fc (Fig. 4C ) and MERS-CoV S1 protein without Fc (Fig. 4D) , suggesting that the antibodies are specific for the RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein. Detection of IgG subtype antibody responses revealed that S377-588-Fc was able to induce both IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) antibody responses in the vaccinated mice ( Fig. 4E-F) . However, the PBS control group could not induce significant antibody responses against MERS-CoV S-RBD and S1 proteins (Fig. 4) .

Neutralizing antibodies in sera of mice at 10 days post-last vaccination with S377-588-Fc protein were evaluated by a live MERS-CoV-based neutralization assay in a Vero E6 cell culture system. As shown in Figure 5A , S377-588-Fc induced high neutralizing antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers of 1:1.5610 3 61.2610 3 , while mouse sera from the PBS control group exhibited no significant neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. These results suggest that S377-588-Fc protein could induce potent anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated animals.

Antibodies in antisera of mice immunized with S377-588-Fc protein effectively blocked S377-588 binding to DPP4 receptor To test whether mouse antibodies against S377-588-Fc could block RBD binding DPP4, we incubated S377-588-Fc with DPP4expressing Huh-7 cells in the presence and absence of mouse antisera, as described in Materials and Methods, followed by flow cytometric analysis. In the absence of antisera, strong signals were detected in S377-588-Fc-incubated Huh-7 cells, while only background signals were observed in the control hIgG-Fcincubated cells (Fig. 5Ba) , confirming that the truncated RBD (S377-588) could specifically bind to the DPP4-expressing cells. However, in the presence of antisera against S377-588-Fc, the binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was effectively blocked, while the control sera from PBS-vaccinated mice showed no significant inhibition on the binding of S377-588 to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (Fig. 5Bb ).

Because of the high mortality of the SARS-like disease caused by MERS-CoV and its human-to-human transmissibility [4] , development of effective therapeutics and vaccines for intervention and prevention is urgently needed [10] . Previous studies have shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV is one of the most important targets for developing SARS-CoV entry inhibitors and SARS vaccines [20, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Therefore, we used similar approaches to identify the optimal sequence of RBD in MERS-CoV S protein as a target for developing anti-MERS therapeutics and vaccines. Several groups have independently solved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV S-RBD (residues 367-588 or 367-606), which contains the RBM (residues 484-567) (Fig. 1A ) [17] [18] [19] . Mou et al. and our group have shown that the recombinant proteins containing residues 358-588 and 377-662, respectively, could induce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals [15, 16] , suggesting that the overlapping region, which spans residues 377-588, must contain the major neutralizing epitope. Based on these findings, we designed a truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588, which contains the RBM (residues 484-567) of MERS-CoV S protein S1 subunit, and expressed a recombinant protein covering this region fused with Fc of human IgG. Fusion of Fc tag with S377-588 was carried out in order to 1) facilitate the affinity-purification of the Fc-containing fusion protein using protein A beads [20, 28] ; 2) increase the immunogenicity of the Fc-containing protein [15] , possibly through the binding of Fc in the protein to the Fc receptor (FcR) on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [29] ; and 3) increase the in vivo half-life and stability of the Fc-containing protein by the formation of stable dimeric or tetrameric conformational structure [30] .

As expected, the purified S377-588-Fc fusion protein could form a stable dimeric or tetrameric structure being able to bind efficiently to sDPP4, as well as cell-surface receptor DPP4 (Fig. 2) , resulting in the potent inhibition of MERS-CoV infection in DPP4-expressing cells (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that the formation of dimer or tetramer by S377-588-Fc does not hinder the binding to its receptor DPP4. Thus, S377-588-Fc appeared much more potent than S358-588-Fc and S367-588 in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection [16, 19] , indicating that removal of the S358-376 fragment might have an enhancing effect on RBDmediated anti-MERS-CoV activity.

Like antibodies, recombinant proteins can also be used as clinical therapeutics for the treatment of cancer [31] [32] [33] . The The data are presented as mean A450 6 standard deviation (SD) of five mice per group. Ability of IgG binding to MERS-CoV S-RBD (C) and S1 protein (D) was detected using mouse sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. Ability of IgG1 (E) and IgG2a (F) antibodies binding to MERS-CoV S-RBD was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. The data are presented as mean A450 6 SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081587.g004 peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor enfuvirtide has been used for treating HIV infection [34] [35] [36] . Because of its potent inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV entry, the recombinant S377-588-Fc protein may be further developed as a MERS-CoV entry inhibitor for treatment of MERS-CoV infection in the acute stage. The major concern for use of protein drugs in clinics is their production of antibodies, which may suppress drug efficacy. However, this may not be a concern for the MERS-CoV S-RBD protein-based therapeutic. First, the human IgG Fc in the S377-588-Fc fusion protein is not expected to induce antibodies in humans. Second, S377-588-Fc will be mainly used for urgent life-saving treatment at the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. Even if it does elicit anti-RBD antibodies in the patient several weeks after use, the patient may have passed through the most dangerous acute period. The antibodies induced by the protein drug may be actually helpful for the patient to neutralize the re-entered MERS-CoV.

We then tested immunogenicity of the truncated RBD of MERS-CoV S protein in inducing anti-MERS-CoV immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Notably, S377-588-Fc elicited elevated MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG antibody responses after each boost, reaching the highest level after the 3 rd vaccination (Fig. 4) . These mouse antisera exhibited potent neutralizing antibody responses with neutralizing antibody titers of ,1:1,500, which are much higher than those induced by S377-662-Fc [15] . These data suggest that the truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588 is more immunogenic in inducing RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response than the longer RBD fragment containing residues 377-662, possibly because the C-terminal region spanning residues 589-662 contains non-neutralizing epitopes, which may compete with the neutralizing epitopes in the residues 377-588 region in eliciting antibody responses. In addition, the residues 589-662 fragment may destabilize the core conformation of the RBD. Analysis of the crystal structure of the RBD suggests that cysteines 379 and 585 are both involved in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the RBD by forming disulfide bonds with their respective cysteine partners. A few extra residues (e.g., residues 377-378 at the N-terminus and residues 586-588 at the C-terminus) may be needed to flank these cysteines for the proper formation of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 6 ) [19] . However, the extended region at the C-terminus (residues 589-662) may have adverse effect on tertiary conformation of the core structure (residues 379-585). Therefore, this truncated RBD fragment (residues 377-588) may have reached the optimal length of RBD that contains the intact functional domain (RBM: residues 484-567) and major neutralizing epitopes, and maintains a stable core conformation.

Our previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV S-RBDinduced antibodies are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV S-RBD- binding to ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV [24] . Similarly, we demonstrated here that antisera of mice vaccinated with the truncated S-RBD (S377-588) of MERS-CoV could also efficiently block the binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD to its receptor, DPP4, indicating that antibodies in the mouse antisera can neutralize MERS-CoV infection, possibly through inhibition of virusreceptor binding. Therefore, both S-RBD protein and anti-RBD antibodies can be developed as therapeutics to treat MERS-CoV infection.

It is necessary to further test the therapeutic and preventive effects of this truncated S-RBD in an animal model. Thus far, however, no small animal model has been established for a MERS-CoV challenge study [37] . While the lung cells of Syrian hamster express the receptor of MERS-CoV, it was reported that this animal model was not susceptible to the induction of MERS-CoV infection [38] . Rhesus macaques could generate pneumonialike symptoms within 24 hours of MERS-CoV infection [39] ; however, the macaque system is not as widely applicable as a small animal model. Therefore, we are awaiting the establishment of a small animal model in order to carry out viral challenge studies.

In conclusion, we have identified a 212-amino acid truncated RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc. This protein, denoted S377-588-Fc, can effectively bind to the viral receptor, DPP4, and potently inhibit MERS-CoV infection in DPP4-expressing cells. It can also induce strong RBDspecific antibody responses with potent neutralizing activity against infection from MERS-CoV. Therefore, this truncated S-RBD linked with Fc shows potential for further development as both therapeutic and vaccine for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection.

Six-to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were used in the study. The animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the New York Blood Center (Permit Number: 194.14).

The construction, expression and purification of recombinant MERS-CoV S proteins were done as previously described with some modifications [40] . Briefly, genes encoding residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using codonoptimized MERS-CoV S sequences (GenBank: AFS88936.1) as the template and then inserted into the pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named Fc; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). The MERS-CoV S1 (residues 18-725) plus 66Histidine (His) was amplified as above and inserted into the pJW4303 expression vector (Jiangsu Taizhou Haiyuan Protein Biotech, Co., Ltd, China). The sequence-confirmed recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) seeded 24 h before transfection, followed by replacement of culture medium by serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 8 h later and then collection of supernatant containing expressed protein 72 h posttransfection. The recombinant proteins were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) (for proteins with Fc) or Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (for proteins with His tag), according to the manufacturers' instructions.

The human DPP4 ectodomain (residues 39-766) was expressed and purified as previously described for human ACE2 ectodomain [11] . Briefly, human DPP4 ectodomain containing an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a C-terminal 66 His tag was expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen), secreted into cell culture medium, and subsequently purified by Ni-NTA affinity column and Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).

The purified S377-588-Fc protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described [40] . Briefly, the proteins were either boiled for 10 min, or not boiled, and then separated by 10% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels, which were then stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in PBST overnight at 4uC, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with MERS-CoV S protein-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) developed in our laboratories. After three washes, the blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare).

Protein cross-linker was done as previously described [40] . Briefly, 4.5 mg of purified S377-588-Fc protein was mixed with 20 ml of 0.1% glutaraldehyde (final concentration 4 mM) and left at room temperature in the dark for 3 h before SDS-PAGE using 6% Tris-Glycine gel and Western blot detection as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation assay

The binding between MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc and DPP4 was performed by co-immunoprecipitation assay as previously described [15] . Briefly, sDPP4 (10 mg) or DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cell lysates (5610 7 /ml) were respectively incubated with MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein (10 mg) plus Protein A Sepharose Beads at 4uC for 1 h. After washing with lysis buffer and PBS, beads were boiled for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as above for detecting DPP4 using an anti-DPP4 mAb (1 mg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or MERS-CoV S protein using MERS-CoV S1-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) developed in our laboratory.

The binding of MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was also measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells (5610 5 ) were incubated with S377-588-Fc at various concentrations for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with DyLight-488-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody for 30 min and analysis by flow cytometry. Human IgG Fc at the same concentration was used as the control. The inhibition of S377-588-Fc binding to Huh-7 cells by mouse antisera was performed by coincubating sera with MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc (0.5 mg/ml) and cells for 30 min at room temperature. After staining with DyLight-488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, the mixture was analyzed by flow cytometry as above.

Calu-3 cells that are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV [41] were incubated with serially diluted recombinant MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc or hIgG-Fc control protein for 1 h at 37uC. After removing media containing the protein, the cells were infected with MERS-CoV/Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)-2012 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 37uC. After thoroughly washing with PBS to remove unbound viruses, the infected cultures were replenished with MEM/2% FCS medium containing the aforementioned proteins diluted accordingly, followed by incubation for an additional 24 h before assessing the formation of CPE.

This was done as previously described immunization protocols with some modifications [40] . Briefly, mice were prime-vaccinated (s.c.) with 10 mg/mouse of recombinant S377-588-Fc protein formulated with Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant (SEPPIC, Fairfield, NJ) and boosted twice with the same immunogen and adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Sera from pre-immunization and 10 days posteach vaccination were heat-inactivated at 56uC for 30 minutes and detected for S-specific antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies, or blockage of receptor binding.

ELISA ELISA was carried out to detect MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein binding to its receptor sDPP4 or MERS-CoV S-specific antibody responses in collected mouse sera as previously described [15] . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were respectively pre-coated with recombinant sDPP4 (2 mg/ml, for binding), MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc or S1-His protein (1 mg/ml, for antibody response) overnight at 4uC and blocked with 2% non-fat milk for 2 h at 37uC. Serially diluted MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein (for binding) or mouse sera (for antibody detection) were added to the plates and incubated at 37uC for 1 h, followed by four washes. Bound antibodies were respectively incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:3,000, for binding, Invitrogen), or antimouse IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a (1:2,000, for antibody detection, Invitrogen), for 1 h at 37uC. The reaction was visualized by substrate 3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrogen) and stopped by 1N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA).

The standard micro-neutralization assay was used to quantify the neutralizing potential of each specimen, as previously described [15] . Briefly, serum samples were diluted at serial 2fold in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at room temperature for an hour with ,100 infectious MERS-CoV/ EMC-2012 in each well before transferring the resultant mixtures to duplicate wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 72 h of incubation, when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced CPE, the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of CPE. Neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely (100%) inhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells.

Monoclonal antibody-based therapies for microbial diseases,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) revolution that currently provides many new options for the treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases has largely bypassed the field of infectious diseases. Only one mAb is licensed for use against an infectious disease, although there are many in various stages of development. This situation is peculiar given that serum therapy was one of the first effective treatments for microbial diseases and that specific antibodies have numerous antimicrobial properties. The underdevelopment and underutilization of mAb therapies for microbial diseases has various complex explanations that include the current availability of antimicrobial drugs, small markets, high costs and microbial antigenic variation. However, there are signs that the climate for mAb therapeutics in infectious diseases is changing given increasing antibiotic drug resistance, the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy is available, and development of mAb cocktail formulations. Currently, the major hurdle for the widespread introduction of mAb therapies for microbial diseases is economic, given the high costs of immunoglobulin preparations and relatively small markets. Despite these obstacles there are numerous opportunities for mAb development against microbial diseases and the development of radioimmunotherapy provides new options for enhancing the magic bullet. Hence, there is cautious optimism that the years ahead will see more mAbs in clinical use against microbial diseases.","Historical The field of infectious diseases has largely missed the monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutic revolution of the past decade.

In contrast to such fields as oncology and rheumatology where mAbs have provided new effective therapies, only one mAb has pathogenic microbes, often in drug-resistant form, as exemplified by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The reticence for adopting mAb therapies against infectious diseases is intriguing given that antibody therapies were the first effective antimicrobials. In the early 20th century serum therapy was used against a diverse range of infectious diseases, including pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, erysipelas, anthrax and others [3, 4] . These successes established antibody therapy as a powerful tool against infectious disease. Unfortunately, the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, significantly limited its usefulness [4] . Importantly, the problems of serum therapy do not necessarily apply to mAb therapy. Technological developments, such as improved purification techniques and the ability to engineer humanized mAbs, have greatly reduced these complications, allowed for increased specificity and expanded the range of possible targets. However, for many infectious diseases the availability of antimicrobial therapy has proved to be too much competition, and that combined with the complexity of introducing mAbs to clinical practice has hindered the pace of mAb-based therapeutic advancements.

Despite its current underdevelopment, the potential of antibody therapy in the form of mAbs is vast, especially for combating microbes that are resistant to antibiotic therapy, for emerging viral diseases or for the organisms or toxins responsible for bioterrorist threats. We believe that mAbs are well poised to be important reagents in a new age of antimicrobial therapy [2, 5] . In this review, we focus on mAbs for infectious diseases and note that several recent reviews have addressed the topic of antimicrobial immunoglobulin therapy [6] [7] [8] . Our goal is to review the state of the field and to identify areas where the development of mAb-based therapies may be particularly valuable.

The prophylactic and therapeutic potential of immune serum was discovered by Behring and Kitasato, who showed that passive transfer of antibody from the blood of infected animals could provide immunity to diphtheria [9] . Their work led to the first instance of industrial production of protective serum from sheep for human therapy in 1893 [10] and to the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for Behring. Immune animal sera from horses, sheep, and chickens were used to treat diseases where a protective immune response could be induced in the animal host by vaccination. In cases where humans were the only hosts, such as viral diseases, human convalescent sera were successfully used. For example, in the early 1900s, serum from individuals who recovered from measles was used to treat and prevent infection. Until the 1930s, serum from animals or people was collected and pooled to treat a number of infections, from streptococcal infection to toxin-mediated diseases like diphtheria [11] . Overall, serum was effective, and for some diseases like pneumococcal pneumonia and meningococcal meningitis, the prompt administration of serum was associated with significantly improved survival [3] .

However, despite these successes, the discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s rapidly replaced serum therapy. Antibiotics were easier to manufacture, had less toxicity in patients and produced more consistent results. In contrast to serum therapy, which depended on animal sources that exhibited great lot-to-lot variation, antibiotics were the products of industrial processes and could be formulated in preparations with consistent activity. Furthermore, serum therapy was generally effective only early in the course of infection while antibiotic therapy maintained efficacy even when given late in the course of a microbial disease. Another advantage of antibiotic therapy was that it could be used without a specific diagnosis while the use of antibody therapy required knowledge of the pathogen responsible for disease. Consequently, serum therapy was unable to compete with antibiotics, and the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy displaced antibody-based therapies (Table 1) .

Despite the general abandonment of serum therapy for bacterial diseases, certain niches developed where it continued to be used, such as the prophylaxis and treatment of a small number of viral and toxin-mediated diseases for which there were no alternative therapeutic options. This point is important because it illustrated that antibody therapy can thrive in certain situations where it lacked competition, such as in the treatment of diseases which have no other effective therapies. For example, antibody preparations continue to be used to prevent rabies and toxicity from snakebite venoms. In developed countries serum therapy was often replaced by hyperimmune serum from pooled human donors. Today, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin is used to treat many diseases including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VZV), and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [6, 12] .

Compared to hyperimmune sera, or even to modern antibiotics, mAb therapy has many advantages and some disadvantages ( Table 1) . mAbs inherently have a high specificity for their target and, since microbes are generally antigenically distinct from humans, the cross-reactivity with host tissues is minimal. In contrast to antibiotics, which target both harmful microbes and the host flora, mAbs will only target a specific microbe and their systemic administration should not affect other resident beneficial microbes. This could prove to be a significant advantage given increasing reports associating certain chronic diseases such as asthma, atopy, and even certain forms of cancer with antimicrobial drug use [13, 14] . Microbial specificity means that mAbs are unlikely to select for drug-resistant microbes among nontargeted microbes. The ability to specifically target disease-causing microbial populations without selecting for resistance makes mAb therapy potentially superior to current broad-spectrum antibiotics that are generally used in therapy, at least for microbial diseases caused by single microbes. The increasing prevalence and rising cost of treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and other resistant infections in both nosocomial and community settings emphasizes the need to develop new strategies for controlling infections.

Serum therapy by definition uses immune sera-derived immunoglobulins that are polyclonal preparations consisting of many types of antibodies of which only a minute fraction is specific for the intended microbe. In contrast, mAb preparations consist of one type of immunoglobulin with a defined specificity and a single isotype. This represents both an advantage and a disadvantage when mAbs are compared to polyclonal preparations. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-to-lot variability in contrast to polyclonal preparations, which can differ over time and by source of origin since different hosts mount different antibody responses. Another advantage for mAb preparations is a much greater activity per mass of protein since all the immunoglobulin molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus [15] . However, mAb preparations lack variability with regards to epitope and isotype, and consequently polyclonal preparations have potentially greater biological activity by targeting multiple microbial epitopes and providing various effector functions through different isotypes.

With the development of human and humanized mAbs, the toxicity of these agents is also relatively low. Current technology makes the production of mAbs relatively easy and effective, requiring only tissue culture or microbial expression systems, as opposed to the live human or animal donors that were required for serum therapy. Hence, the potential toxicity of human and humanized mAbs is comparable to antibiotics and lower than serum therapy, especially heterologous preparations. mAb therapies are also much less likely to inadvertently transmit other infectious diseases. However, antibody therapies remain very costly relative to antimicrobial drugs. Consequently, mAbs are unlikely to successfully compete with antimicrobial drugs against diseases for which cheap effective therapy is available unless a clear superiority is established for the immunoglobulin therapy alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial therapy. The fact that specific antibodies are often synergistic with conventional antimicrobial therapy suggests that combination therapy with current antimicrobial regimens may confer potential advantages relative to either alone [16, 17] . Not only can mAbs make antibiotics more effective, but the research driving mAb development can also enhance other areas, such as identifying new targets for vaccine development [18, 19] . In this regard, efforts to develop mAb-based therapies have the potential of impacting many aspects of infectious disease medicine. Furthermore, some mAbs can be effective in immunocompromised hosts, as evidenced by the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing hospitalizations for RSV-associated disease in preterm infants [20] . Even in the setting of reduced immune response, mAbs can function to replace lost immunity or benefit the host by direct activity, such as neutralization. Consequently, mAbs are an attractive alternative alone or as adjuncts to current antimicrobial therapy that will be effective in hosts with different states of immunity.

Despite these strengths, mAb therapy has some inherent limitations. The cost factor has already been alluded to and remains a major obstacle to widespread mAb use. Antibodies are macromolecules that are fragile, perishable and require refrigeration, each of which contributes to their high cost. Furthermore, most mAbs require systemic administration, which complicates their delivery in many clinical settings. Finally, a mAb usually cannot be used until a specific diagnosis is made. In an era when broadspectrum antibiotics are relied upon so heavily, treatment is often begun before diagnostic identification of a disease-causing microbe is made [5] . However, recent advances in rapid diagnostic techniques provide hope for earlier specific diagnosis, which is essential for making mAb treatments more realizable. Even so, based on experience with serum therapy, one could anticipate that a mAb will only be effective when administered relatively early in the course of infection. A decrease in antibody efficacy over time occurs quickly as the duration of infection increases, highlighting the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

Another, theoretical drawback to mAb therapy is that these reagents, by definition, target a single epitope, and provide one type of effector function corresponding to their isotype. Although the specificity of mAbs is a strength, a microbe that undergoes rapid antigenic variation poses a significant hurdle for mAb development. For example, the high mutation rate of certain viruses enables them to escape neutralization. There are numerous examples in the literature where experimental mAb therapy has resulted in the emergence of escape variants as a result of microbial mutation and/or microevolution [21] [22] [23] . This problem may be counterbalanced by selecting mAbs that target conserved areas of viral particles or by using mixtures of mAbs that target various epitopes. For example, combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses including influenza [24] , coronavirus [25] , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [26] . Although cocktails are effective in providing protection against the emergence of resistant mutants, the inclusion of multiple immunoglobulins in any therapeutic formulation is fraught with complex regulatory and licensing issues. Nevertheless, progress in overcoming these burdensome regulatory issues is evidenced by the recent development of a mAb mixture for the prophylaxis of rabies that targets several virus types [27] . Indeed, as polyclonal sera may be beneficial due to the presence of multiple protective antibodies, a cocktail of functional mAbs could provide more protection and target more microbial strains than a single one. As experience with mAb cocktails accumulates it may be possible to design therapeutic combinations that include multiple effector functions in the form of different isotypes and epitope specificities.

Even in the face of these obstacles, mAb therapy is booming in other areas of medicine, with over 20 in clinical use, representing a market that is expected to reach $20 billion by 2010 [28] . The majority of approved mAbs treat cancer, autoimmune or allergic conditions, where they have shown considerable success and spawned a mAb 'gold rush' [29] . The antigenic differences between the host and the microbe make mAb development for infectious diseases easier than for cancer or immunity fields, where the target is often a self-antigen that is differentially expressed in transformed cells. Additionally, mAbs have direct and indirect antimicrobial mechanisms of action. Direct mechanisms include neutralizing toxins or binding to viruses to prevent host cell entry. Recently mAbs have also been shown to be directly bactericidal [30] . Indirect mechanisms involve Fc-mediated functions, such as modulation of the inflammatory response, promoting opsonic phagocytosis, and enhancing complement-mediated effects. This wide array of functions makes mAbs potentially useful against a variety of infectious diseases.

Despite these advantages, there is currently only one licensed mAb for an infectious disease, and understanding its success is instructive for the possibilities inherent in this approach. The humanized mAb palivizumab, brand name Synagis ® , binds the RSV F protein and is effective for the prevention of severe respiratory disease in high-risk infants and immunocompromised adults [31] . It received regulatory approval in 1998. Prior to palivizumab, prophylaxis of RSV disease depended on RespiGam, or RSV-IGIV, a prophylactic polyclonal RSV hyperimmune serum [1] . This prior polyclonal preparation was plagued by low specific activity, and effective dosing required the administration of large volumes of antibody, which was problematic in low weight infants. Palivizumab obviated this problem since it had 50-fold greater potency than the polyclonal serum, and this example shows how greater specific activity can translate into a superior product. The greater potency significantly reduced the volume needed to deliver a therapeutic dose to an infant and has improved treatment while avoiding the side effects of pooled serum.

In our view opportunities for the development of mAbs include niches where their use would bring a large therapeutic benefit relative to existing therapies. Although there are many diseases where mAb therapy could make a major contribution (see below) the economics are not favorable in each instance. In this regard, the exquisite specificity of antibody-based therapies means necessarily smaller markets than broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. This combined with the relatively high costs of producing and delivering immunoglobulin therapies can make the market analysis of many reagents not economically viable. However, for microbial diseases with inadequate therapeutic options, antibody-based therapies are likely to be competitive, provided that the disease prevalence is of sufficient size to create a tenable demand.

It is noteworthy that even for diseases where there is currently adequate antimicrobial therapy, new developments could make mAb more attractive. For example, consider the case of antibiotic prophylaxis against Group B streptococcus (GBS) neonatal sepsis. Mothers carrying GBS are routinely treated with antibiotics and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in neonatal disease. However, antibiotic therapy affects the infant microflora and has been epidemiologically linked to the development of atopy and asthma in children [14] . Furthermore, prophylactic antibiotic therapy can select for resistant microbes or disturb the flora in a manner that could make colonization with resistant microbes more likely, could be followed by superinfections, and may even have untoward consequences later in life [5] . Passive antibody therapy against GBS is also effective [32] and not encumbered by the problems of altered flora and its consequences. Hence, the economics of passive antibody and antibiotic prophylaxis are more nuanced than simply valuing the different alternatives. A truer cost comparison must take into account the complications that follow broad-spectrum therapy.

Historically, the major targets for antibody therapy have been diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria (e.g. pneumococcus and meningococcus), toxins (e.g. diphtheria and tetanus) and viruses. In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future. Our goal is to survey this field, with the understanding that cataloguing all ongoing efforts is beyond the scope of this article.

Viral targets are particularly attractive because for most viruses there is no specific therapy. The potential for mAbs to be used as neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral binding and entry to host cells makes them a good platform for prophylaxis, preemptive or acute treatment of viral illnesses [34] . There are several current areas of viral mAb development, and many in clinical trials (see Table 2 ).

While the approved drug palivizumab is effective against RSV disease in susceptible groups, there has been considerable effort to develop 2nd and 3rd generation mAbs: motavizumab (brand name Numax ® ) and Numax-YTE ® [1] . Motavizumab was engineered to have increased affinity through induced somatic hypermutation, with the hopes that increased binding will improve function in humans, and is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials. Numax-YTE is the result of additional efforts to prolong this mAb's serum half-life, another potential avenue of mAb development. Furthermore, clinical trials are underway testing both escalating doses of mAb and intramuscular (i.m.) administration, showing that the improvement of delivery and dosing of mAb drugs are an important next step in advancing therapy. These developments illustrate how technological advances may improve existing successful mAb therapeutics.

HIV has always been an area of great interest for mAb therapy [35] [36] [37] [38] . There are several mAbs for HIV in development, designed to inhibit viral entry, reduce viral load in HIV-patients, and potentially to prevent infection in certain cases [39, 40] . Viral entry inhibitor mAbs target either the cellular receptors, CCR5 and CD4, or the cognate viral protein gp120. Efforts to develop neutralizing mAbs with broader strain specificity have found success targeting the V3 loop of gp120 [41] . As is true with all mAbs designed for infectious disease, the development of a successful vaccine would reduce their need. However, given the slow progress on the front of HIV vaccine development, mAb research in the HIV field is a promising alternative. Although there are numerous antiretroviral drugs available for the treatment of HIV, the availability of effective mAb therapy could complement chemotherapy by slowing the onset of resistance and possibly enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

Another target for mAb development is CMV. Sevirumab is currently being assessed for treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected individuals and neonatal congenital CMV. Another important complication of CMV infection is reactivation disease, a distinct burden on transplantation medicine. CMV infects a large portion of the population, at least 60% of adults in the U.S., and the virus can reactivate with devastating consequences during the course of immunosuppression that solid organ or hematologic transplant patients must undergo [42] . The use of mAb to control this reactivation is an area of development that could benefit a large number of patients.

Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) infections are areas where antibody therapies offer great hope in helping to control disease and improve transplantation success. Hepatitis remains the leading indication for liver transplant, and viral reinfection of the transplanted liver is a major complication. Two different monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for the improving transplant success, of which neither are specific for the virus itself. Both bavituximab, specific for phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid exposed on membranes of damaged cells, and MDX-1106, specific for PD-1, an inhibitory T cell costimulation receptor, have been used to control chronic hepatitis infection, particularly in the setting of HIV-coinfection [34, 43] . The threat of a new pandemic makes influenza virus an important candidate for mAb development, with research currently being done to characterize human neutralizing antibodies and explore their therapeutic potential [24, 44, 45] . Historically, influenza virus has been extremely challenging because of its high antigenic variability. However, progress has been made in identifying antibodies that are broadly neutralizing [46, 47] . In the event of a new pandemic mAbs could provide important options for disease control since they confer immediate immunity and may be used as prophylaxis for individuals who are likely to have been exposed to infection. Considerable excitement followed the discovery of a broadly cross-reactive antibody specific for HA2 of influenza A that allows the neutralization of different viral strains, including avian H5N1 and human H1N1 [48] . Technology now exists where plasma cells secreting influenza-specific antibody can be cloned from human donors and used to generate high affinity mAbs within a matter of weeks [49] .

Another promising opportunity for antibody therapy is rabies, where current standard of care depends on administration of immune globulin and vaccination. In this regard, a major innovation was the development of the mAb cocktail CL184 [27] . This cocktail is comprised of two mAbs, specific for two different epitopes of the rabies virus, and shows good neutralizing activity in vitro and was well tolerated in patients. Its success validates the idea that cocktails of multiple mAbs represent an important logistical improvement in mAb therapy, allowing for expanded target coverage, broader specificity and a wider range of effector functions.

There is no available vaccine or specific therapeutic agent for human flaviviral infections, and after the outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1999, efforts were directed towards developing antibody therapies for prophylactic treatment [50] . A hyperimmune preparation derived from human convalescent sera protected mice from West Nile virus (WNV), both in the setting of induced immunocompromise and after the onset of encephalitis [51] . This observation suggested that antibody was effective at treating disease after dissemination to the brain and spinal cord had occurred. Development of mAb treatment for WNV in elderly or immunocompromised patients might prevent the debilitating disease and paralysis that can occur in these populations [52] . MGAWN1, a humanized mAb to the structural envelope protein, is currently in clinical trials, and could provide a new therapeutic option against WNV.

The ability to rapidly identify microbial targets and produce mAbs makes them a feasible tool to combat emergent situations. An excellent example of the rapidity with which mAbs can be generated in response to an outbreak was provided by the response to SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV). In early 2003, respiratory disease due to the virus broke out in human populations, and within a year the cellular receptor [53] and viral glycoprotein [54] responsible for binding were identified. By early 2004, neutralizing human mAbs had been developed and were being tested by laboratories [55] , illustrating the potential speed of bench-to-bedside transition. Human mAbs have been developed to the Hendra and Nipah viruses, which are both paramyxoviruses that can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers and were responsible for outbreaks in the late 1990s [56, 57] . Emerging diseases are just one area where research into the specificity of mAb targets and their protective efficacy in animal models should be a priority. Other areas where mAbs targeting a needed pathogen may be in development but have not reached clinical trials yet are listed in Table 3 .

Bacterial diseases mediated by toxins have historically responded to specific antibody and consequently remain good targets for treatment with toxin-neutralizing mAbs. In addition to toxin-mediated diseases, recent studies have shown that specific mAbs can alter the course of bacterial and fungal infection, and that immunoglobulins can enhance the action of other antimicrobials. The issue of mAb synergy with conventional antimicrobial drugs is of particular importance since development of mAbs as an adjunct to existing therapy is an attractive possibility to improve therapeutic outcomes for bacterial infection. Several mAbs, targeting diseases that are in clinical trials (Table 2 ) or being developed as needed therapeutics (Table 3) , are discussed below.

The Shiga-like toxin IIB produced by pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli is responsible for organ damage in the hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that develop dur- [58, 59] . Several mAbs designed to neutralize the systemic toxin have been developed, and one is currently having success in phase I clinical trials [60] [61] [62] .

Another toxin-mediated disease of growing concern is Clostridium difficile colitis, which usually results from broad-spectrum antibiotic use [63] . Although oral antibiotics can often clear infection, there are indications that new hypervirulent strains are emerging, which increase disease severity [64] . Furthermore, for certain individuals the disease can become chronic [65] . mAbs to toxin A and toxin B are in development and currently being tested in clinical trials. Laboratory research has shown that mAbs may act by more than just direct binding and neutralization of toxin, as Fc receptors have been shown to be essential for mAb protection, presumably through increasing endocytic uptake of the toxin by effector cells [66] . The increasing prevalence and toll of this disease underscores both the dangers of antibiotic use and the potential for mAb as a new therapy platform. mAbs may become essential tools to fight this and many other hospital-acquired infections, where often antibiotics have already failed to improve outcomes [67] .

Staphylococcal disease is an example of bacterial disease where both the bacterium and disease-mediating toxins can be targeted by mAbs. Two mAbs in clinical trials recognize staphylococcal virulence factors. Pagibaximab is a chimeric mAb specific for lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which was shown to be protective against both coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus infection [68] . Certain populations are very susceptible to staphylococcal disease, such as very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns, where pagibaximab is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for preventing infection [69, 70] . Another target is the S. aureus protein clumping factor A (ClfA), targeted by tefibazumab (brand name Aurexis ® ) which is in phase II clinical trials for S. aureus bacteremia [71] . These two mAbs show promise and provide hope for the development of improved mAbs targeting staphylococcal species. Alpha-hemolysin (H1a) is a pore-forming cytotoxin that is an essential virulence factor for the development staphylococcal pneumonia. Researchers have recently shown that passive administration of a mAb to H1a, as well as vaccination to elicit active immunity against this antigen, afforded protection to pneumonia in mouse models [72] .

Antibodies neutralizing toxins and viruses can provide immediate defense against many biological weapons [73] . Anthrax is an example of one such disease, where current treatment recommendations are inadequate, as the anthrax vaccine is currently not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis and antibiotic-resistant strains of Bacillus anthracis are a rising concern [74] . Protective antigen (PA) is the common subunit to the two dimeric anthrax toxins, where PA pairs with edema factor (EF) or lethal factor (LF) to form cellular toxins mediating edema and cell death, respectively. The two mAbs specific for PA currently in clinical trials are anthim, which was just announced to be restarting phase I clinical trials, and raxibacumab, which is currently maintained by the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. Toxins from Clostridium botulinum are another example of extremely potent neurotoxins that can lead to fatal respiratory disease and are capable of being weaponized. Development of mAbs to neutralize these toxins for post-exposure treatment is an important avenue of research.

One area where antibody therapy has long provided the only therapeutic option is the neutralization of snake venoms. Most of the current preparations fall into the category of serum therapy, with immunoglobulins derived from heterologous sources. One group has developed human single chain variable antibody fragments (HuScFv) from a phage display library that are effective in neutralizing the neurotoxin and preventing lethality in mice [75] , illustrating how new mAb technology and antibody formats are able to improve and expand on current treatments. However, economics could pose a formidable problem with developing mAbs venom therapy, since the number of different poisons is great and, fortunately, the number of cases is relatively few.

Fungal diseases are a promising area for mAb therapy. Fungal diseases are chronic, difficult to treat, and carry a high mortality and morbidity despite antifungal therapy. For this group of diseases mAb therapy could find a niche because current therapies are suboptimal. To date only one mAb has been studied clinically for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis [76] . That antibody reduced serum cryptococcal antigen but only at very high doses, which made it economically unfeasible. An antibody fragment to a surface heat shock protein showed promising efficacy against human candidiasis in a phase III trial [16] . Recently a broadly crossreactive mAb to a fungal cell wall antigen was described that was effective against experimental aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis [77, 78] . Another example of broadly active antifungal mAbs are those that mimic killer toxin action [79] .

The exquisite specificity of antibodies for their targets provides a means of delivering harmful cargo to their targets. This concept has long been recognized in oncology where investigators have tried to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor antibody therapies by conjugating antibodies to bacterial toxins and radioisotopes. Like use of mAb therapy in general, the field of infectious diseases has been slow in adopting such strategies, although considerable experimental work was done to develop immunotoxins to target HIV-infected cells [80] . Nevertheless, in recent years progress has been made developing radioimmunotherapy for infectious diseases.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) was first developed for cancer treatment almost three decades ago [81] . RIT uses the antigen-antibody interaction to deliver radionuclides that emanate lethal doses of cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells [82, 83] , and can provide a valuable alternative to chemotherapy and external radiation beam therapy (EBRT). RIT is a successful therapy for certain cancers as evidenced by the recent approval of mAb-based drugs such as Zevalin ® and Bexxar ® (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with 90-Yttrium ( 90 Y) and 131-Iodine ( 131 I), respectively) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recent reports on the use of RIT as an initial treatment for follicular lymphoma [84] are encouraging thus making RIT first line therapy in some types of cancer.

Until recently the potential of RIT as an antimicrobial strategy had not been explored. The reasons for this are enigmatic but could reflect the lack of awareness of the difficult problems in clinical infectious diseases by the nuclear medicine community and of RIT by the infectious diseases community. During the last 5 years RIT has been successfully adapted in our laboratories for the treatment of experimental fungal, bacterial and viral infections [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . Here we briefly review the data on efficacy and safety of RIT of infectious diseases.

The potential efficacy of RIT against an infectious diseases was first established using Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) [85] . CN is a major fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in 6-8% of patients with AIDS. CN provided a good system to study the potential usefulness of RIT because there were excellent animal models available, well characterized mAbs to CN antigens existed, and immunotherapy of CN infection with capsule polysaccharide-binding antibody 18B7 was already in clinical evaluation [76] . In spite of high level of circulating polysaccharide in the blood of infected mice, in both pulmonary and systemic animal models of CN infection radiolabeled mAb preferentially localized to the sites of infection. mAb 18B7 radiolabeled with 213-bismuth ( 213 Bi) or 188-rhenium ( 188 Re) killed CN cells in vitro, thus providing the basis for in vivo experiments in AJ/Cr mice infected systemically with CN. Mice treated with radiolabeled CN-specific mAb 18B7 lived significantly longer than mice given irrelevant labeled IgG1 or PBS. Mice infected with CN and given RIT had significantly reduced fungal burden in lungs and brains 48 h after treatment compared to infected mice in the control groups.

The antimicrobial RIT approach was subsequently extended to another human pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) [86] , which is the most common cause of fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [91] , by treating HC in vitro with 188 Re-labeled mAb 9C7 (IgM) which binds to a protein antigen on the surface of the HC cell wall [92] . Ninety percent of HC cells were killed with 32 Ci HC-specific 188 Re-9C7 mAb. In contrast, incubation of HC with a radiolabeled control IgM with the same specific activity produced only minimal killing within the investigated range of doses. Cellular dosimetry calculations based on the mean absorbed dose to the cell showed that RIT with alpha-and betaemitting radioisotopes was approximately 1000-fold more efficient in killing CN and approximately 100-fold more efficient in killing HC than gamma radiation.

The potential of RIT against bacterial infection was established using Streptococcus pneumoniae because this is an important extracellular pathogen, and there are good animal models and mAbs available [88] . A greater percentage of mice treated with 213 Bi-D11 survived relative to the control groups, where mice in control groups succumbed to bacteremia on days 1-3, while mice treated with 80 Ci 213 Bi-D11 mice demonstrated 87-100% survival. Treatment with radiolabeled D11 was very well tolerated as no weight loss was observed in treated animals.

RIT could also be potentially effective against chronically infected cells including those with viral infections [6] . In contrast to RIT of fungal and bacterial diseases where the target is the microbe itself, in RIT of viral infections the infected mammalian cells would be targeted thus providing a general strategy for eliminating reservoirs of infected cells and viral cellular factories. This approach could be developed for the treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains [93] . The efficacy of RIT for treatment of HIV infection in vivo was explored with a radiolabeled HIV envelope-specific human anti-gp41 mAb 246-D radiolabeled with 213 Bi and 188 Re [89] . For these studies human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with HIV-1 JR-CSF were injected into the spleens of SCID mice and the mice were treated with RIT. Treatment of mice with 188 Re-labeled mAb 246-D administered either before or after intrasplenic injection with HIV-1 JR-CSF -infected human PBMCs dramatically reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells. Similar results were obtained after treatment of mice with 213 Bi-246-D. Administration of equivalent amounts of ""cold"" mAb 246-D or of a radioisotope-coupled irrelevant control mAb did not reduce the average number of infected cells detected in the SCID mouse spleens. The demonstration of efficacy of RIT against HIV provided a proof-of-principle for the concept of treating viral infections by targeting viral-infected cells and this approach could potentially be applied to other chronic viral diseases like hepatitis C.

The success of RIT approach in laboratory studies combined with earlier nuclear medicine experience on pre-clinical and clinical studies showing the utility of radiolabeled organism-specific antibodies for imaging of infections (reviewed in [94] ) provides encouragement for the feasibility of therapeutically targeting microbes with labeled antibodies. In fact, the ability of specific antibody to localize to a site of infection provides strong support for the potential usefulness of this technique as a broad antimicrobial strategy. It might be possible to create a so-called ""pan-antibody"" which would recognize an antigen shared by a particular class of human pathogens. An example of such a ""pan-antibody"" is mAb 6D2 initially developed against fungal melanin that also binds to synthetic, invertebrate (cuttlefish), murine and human melanins [95] . The availability of such antibodies would eliminate the necessity of having antibodies specific for each particular microorganism and would enormously enhance the development of RIT of infectious diseases.

Considering the breadth of research into new targets for microbial mAbs, as well as the vast need for new therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases, this area of medicine is a growing field. There are many new approaches to improving the efficacy of mAbs, such as using cocktails of mAbs or combining mAbs with existing drugs for synergistic effects. There are also many new research developments that will expand the possibilities for mAb drugs. The next generation of mAbs could be developed against novel targets, such as quorum sensing molecules, which regulate bacterial growth and virulence factor expression [96] , or type III secretion systems, which are used by a subset of microbes to infect host cells [97] . To fight MDR bacteria, some successful approaches have targeted the cellular efflux pumps responsible for antibiotic resistance [98] . In general, more of these types of ""broad-spectrum"" mAbs will enable a therapeutic mAb to be developed which could be useful against a number of microbes, thus extending its market and increasing its profit potential. Bavituximab is an example of one such mAb, specific for phospholipids on the exposed inner surface of damaged cells, where potential applications include both HIV and HCV [34] . Progress has also been made generating mAbs that have bispecificity, where mAb variants are selected that bind to multiple microbial epitopes [99] . Finally, more direct engineering of mAbs could result in enhanced efficacy, such as Fc region alterations that can extend serum half-life or influence effector function [100] . For example, alterations in Fc region glycosylation can increase antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [101] . Although this review has focused on the use of intact mAbs against microbial diseases, we note that for some microbes the Fc region is not necessary for efficacy, providing numerous additional therapeutic options. For example, mAb fragments which lack Fc regions can be effective in situations where effector cell function is not necessary, for example in inhibiting HIV entry [102] .

We are cautiously optimistic that the mAb therapeutic revolution will make a much greater impact against microbial diseases in the years ahead. There is no shortage of targets for mAbs to treat microbial diseases. At this time, the major problem is economic and it is likely that success will come first in niche areas where there is sufficient need, urgency, and market size to support the development of mAb therapies. In the longer term, the field needs to build economic models that are suitable for the development of antibody therapies against a much broader set of microbial targets.

Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Hantaviruses,"Hantaviruses (HVs) are rodent-transmitted viruses that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. Together, these viruses have annually caused approximately 200,000 human infections worldwide in recent years, with a case fatality rate of 5-15% for HFRS and up to 40% for HCPS. There is currently no effective treatment available for either HFRS or HCPS. Only whole virus inactivated vaccines against HTNV or SEOV are licensed for use in the Republic of Korea and China, but the protective efficacies of these vaccines are uncertain. To a large extent, the immune correlates of protection against hantavirus are not known. In this review, we summarized the epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis of four HFRS-causing viruses, HTNV, SEOV, PUUV, and DOBV, and two HCPS-causing viruses, ANDV and SNV, and then discussed the existing knowledge on vaccines and therapeutics against these diseases. We think that this information will shed light on the rational development of new vaccines and treatments.","In recent years, the repeated outbreak of hantavirus disease has caused a serious threat to human health. The spread of hantavirus from natural hosts to humans is a natural ecological process; however, the outbreak of hantavirus is driven by striped field mouse population cycle dynamics and seasonal climate change (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) .

Hantavirus is a virus transmitted mainly by rodent animals, mainly through urine, feces, and saliva and the aerosols produced by them, but rarely by the bites of infected animals (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . In recent years, the infection rate of hantavirus has increased in China and Europe (Dong et al., 2019) . Hantavirus disease has turned out to be a newly identified but not a ""new"" disease in Germany (Kruger et al., 2013) . The clinical presentations may vary according to viral strains prevalence in different regions. In Asia, hantavirus infection by Hantan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) targets mainly the human kidney and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In North America, infection by Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) manifests in mainly the lung and leads to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with high mortality rates; in Europe, infection by Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) typically causes a milder form of HFRS, nephropathia epidemica (NE) (Echterdiek et al., 2019) .

Currently, there is no approved post-exposure therapeutic countermeasure against hantaviral infection, but diversified treatment strategies have been developed and applied to manage HFRS or HCPS. These strategies target viral life cycle, host immunological factors, or patient clinical symptoms. Preventive measures against hantaviral infection, especially vaccine development, are essential for future pandemics. In this paper, we reviewed the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hantavirus, and discuss the existing knowledge on vaccine and therapeutics against these diseases in order to shed light on the development of new vaccines and treatments.

China has the highest incidence and mortality of HFRS in the world, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of HFRS cases in the world (Zheng et al., 2018) . In 2004, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) established the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) online, and HFRS cases of the whole country were reported daily through this system (Zhang et al., 2014) . From 2006 to 2012, a total of 77,558 cases and 866 deaths were reported with the average annual incidence rate of 0.83 per 100,000, mortality rate of 0.01 per 100,000 and case fatality rate of 1.13% (Zhang et al., 2014) , and its main causative pathogens are HTNV and SEOV (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) . So far, HFRS cases have been reported in 30 out of 32 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) (Zhang et al., 2014) . In recent years, the incidence is still high in eastern China (Tian et al., 2017) . The distribution map of hantavirus cases reported in recent Chinese literatures is summarized in Figure 1 . More than 90% of the total cases were clustered in nine provinces and mainly reported in spring and autumn-winter seasons. We can observe that the annual average number of cases in Shaanxi Province was higher than 2000, ranking at the top of the list (Figure 1) . From 2006 to 2017, Shaanxi has gradually become the province with the highest incidence in China, with approximately 4.51 cases/100,000 cases, of which more than 90% are concentrated in the central region (Xi'an, Xianyang, Baoji, and Weinan cities) (Zheng et al., 2018) . By November 20 of 2017, 878 people were recorded infected in Shaanxi Province (Dong et al., 2019) . We also can observe that the average annual number of cases in the cities of Shannxi, Shandong, and Jiangxi Province rank the top three (Supplementary Figure 1) . Another place with a high incidence of HFRS is Qingdao city of Shandong Province, where HFRS incidence is three times higher than the national average, reaching 0.83/100,000 (Jiang et al., 2017) .

In the US, 34 states have confirmed and recorded HCPS cases since 1993 (Prince and Lieberman, 2013) . In 2008, the first locally acquired case of HFRS caused by the SEOV was confirmed. In 2017, the US CDC investigated an outbreak of SEOV infection that has infected 17 rat owners in seven states (Kerins et al., 2018) . The number of hantavirus cases by year in different states is summarized in Figure 2 . In Canada, HCPS is still very rare, but cases are recorded every year and show seasonal patterns, mainly between March and May and between September and November. A total of 64 cases have been confirmed since 2000, of which 12 were reported in 2013, most in western Canadian provinces such as Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan (Kerins et al., 2018) . SNV and ANDV are responsible for the majority of hantavirus cases leading to HCPS.

Outside North America, individual cases and small clusters of HCPS have been reported in Balkans, northern Sweden (Bergstedt Oscarsson et al., 2016) , Argentina (Pini et al., 2003) , Chile (Toro et al., 1998) , Poland (Gut et al., 2018) , Bolivia (1998) , Brazil (Suzuki et al., 2004; Limongi et al., 2009) , Serbia (Stanojevic et al., 2019) , United Kingdom (Duggan, 2019) , Panama (Bayard et al., 2004) , and Germany (Ettinger et al., 2012) . Overall, in Europe, the incidence of hantavirus infections has steadily increased in recent years: In 2014, a record number of 3754 infections were registered across Europe . Chile has had an average of 67 cases per year since 1995; the disease occurs mainly in spring and summer. However, between June and October 2011, there was an increase in cases and rodent populations (Toro et al., 1998) . In Paraguay, an HCPS case was first found in the Chako region in 1995. A total of 56 cases were reported in 2011, and 18 cases were reported in 2012 (Padula et al., 2007) . In Panama, HCPS first appeared in 1999, with an average of 12 patients per year. However, 16 cases were reported in 2012, and 14 cases were confirmed as of 21 August 2013. For the first time since 1997, Uruguay has experienced HCPS cases, with an average of nine cases per year. The first case was recorded in northern Uruguay in 2010. In Poland, the infections are caused by mainly the PUUV and DOBV serotypes. The morbidity is not high; it ranges between 0.02 and 0.14 per 100,000 cases, but some papers suggest that the data concerning Poland is underestimated (Gut et al., 2018) , because the number of infections then was higher, and it was most likely the epidemic year. In the following year, 2015, there were 6 infections, and in 2016 and 2017, there were 8 and 14 cases registered, respectively. In Germany, from 2001 to 2010, the incidence increased from 0.09 to 2.47/100,000 (Ettinger et al., 2012) . In United Kingdom, the virus was first identified in laboratory rats in Scotland in 1977, and all but 1 of the 15 cases of SEOV caused acute kidney injury, which were diagnosed by the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (Duggan, 2019) .

Hantaviruses belong to the Family Hantaviridae of Bunyavirales and are a kind of enveloped single negative chain RNA virus (Abudurexiti et al., 2019) . A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the complete amino acid and CDS sequence of the M segment of hantaviruses was made based on the international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) updated taxonomy of the order Bunyavirales in 2019 (see Figure 3 ). This phylogeny shows the modest genetic diversity of the virus family.

The diameter of hantavirus particles is 80-US210 nm, and the structure is spherical or ovoid. They are composed of 20-30% fat, >50% protein, 7% carbohydrates, and 2% RNA. They are very stable and can survive for more than 18 days at 4 • C and −20 • C and 10 days at room temperature . The genome comprises three negative sense, single-stranded RNAs that consist the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments that encode the nucleoprotein (Np), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively (Graham et al., 2019) . The outer membrane of hantavirus is composed of Gn and Gc glycoprotein, which mediates the recognition of and entry into host cells. The crystal structure of HTNV Gn is very similar to that of PUUV Gn, which confirms that hantavirus Gn is conserved in hantavirus (Li et al., 2016; Rissanen et al., 2017) .

Although there have been substantial vaccines, there is no licensed vaccine against hantavirus infection that can be widely used. Despite inactivated hantavirus vaccines being licensed for human use in China and Korea, no such vaccine has been approved in the US or Europe (Tian and Stenseth, 2019) . Current clinical studies of inactivated hantavirus vaccine in China or Korea and clinical trials of DNA vaccines in the US are summarized in Table 1 .

The inactivated vaccines comprise entire virions that are inactivated physically (heat) or chemically. In Korea, Lee and An (Cho et al., 2002) first developed an inactivated HTNV vaccine (IHV), which was prepared from the HTNV strain ROK 84/105, which proliferates in the brains of lactating mice. It has been proven that it can induce protein immunization in mice and humans (Yamanishi et al., 1988) . In 1990, the Korean HFRS vaccine Hantavax was put into commercial production. The total number of HFRS patients hospitalized in South Korea fell sharply from 1234 in 1991 to 415 in 1997 (Cho et al., 2002) . To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Hantavax TM in healthy adults in multicenter phase III clinical trials, three dose schedules at 0, 1, and 13 months were used. The seroconversion rate was 90.14% by IFA but only 23.24% by PRNT50 after two primary doses. One month after vaccination, the positive rate of serum was 87.32 and 45.07% according to IFA and PRNT50, respectively. The neutralizing antibody response of the two initial doses of Hantavax TM was very poor. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out enhanced immunization within 2-6 months to provide timely protection for high-risk groups (Song et al., 2016) .

From January 2011 to February 2017, the South Korean military conducted a case-control study of 100 patients to evaluate the effect of an IHV on HFRS. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) value of the IHV was 59.1%, but the VE value of HFRS highincidence area was higher (78.7%) . However, in 2018, the efficacy of iHV on the progression of HFRS did not show a statistically significant protective effect. From 2009 to 2017, 18 patients inoculated with HFRS vaccine and 110 patients not vaccinated with the HFRS vaccine were recruited at Korean Army Hospital to investigate the severity (AKI) and the efficacy of dialysis events in acute renal injury. Overall, 33.3% of the effective vaccination group had three stages of AKI, compared with 54.5% for the non-vaccinated group. The curative effect of IHV on disease progression was 58.1%, but the curative effect of IHV on HFRS progress did not show a statistically significant protective effect (Yi et al., 2018) .

In China, bivalent inactivated vaccines against HTNV and SEOV infection were produced in 1994 and approved by the Pharmacopoeia of China in 2005. Since 2008, the Chinese government has implemented an expanded immunization program targeting HFRS. China uses approximately 2 million doses of HFRS vaccine every year (Schmaljohn, 2012) . HFRS cases have significantly dropped to less than 20,000 per year. Phase 4 clinical trials of inactivated hantavirus vaccine showed that the median OD values of IgG antibody were 0.005 (0.004-0.016), 0.116 (0.036-0.620), 0.320 (0.065-0.848), and 0.128 (0.011-0.649), and that the positivity rate was 7.7, 40.6, 62.2, and 48.2% at pre-vaccination, 1 month after the two primary doses, at the booster dose and at 18 months after the booster dose, respectively. Although two main doses can help healthy individuals develop immune responses, the three-dose series should be better than the two-dose series (Zheng et al., 2018) . Another clinical study in Xian Yang city in northwest China showed that the positive rate of neutralizing antibody in the unvaccinated group was 10.0%, and the positive rate was 80.0, 90.0, 50.0, and 90%, respectively, at 1, 3, 29, and 33 months after immunization with a vaccine consisting of a mixture of inactivated HTNV and SEOV. This finding indicates that the vaccination program can induce effective humoral immunity in northwestern China and can be maintained up to 33 months after vaccination (Table 1) .

At present, DNA vaccines are the most popular method in the research of HFRS and HCPS vaccines, mainly focusing on the use of a hetero-expression system to produce recombinant M protein. DNA vaccines are characterized by safety because they have replication defects, cannot restore the virulence, and cannot spread from person to person or to the environment. A variety of DNA vaccines against the hantavirus envelope glycoprotein gene were developed by Hopper's group (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) . FIGURE 3 | Hantavirus phylogenetic tree on the basis of the M segment sequences. A maximum clade credibility tree of the complete amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the M segment of viruses belonging to Hantavirus. Different colors represent different clade. These proteins had a high similar signature domain and highly unconserved terminal sequences, which could artificially create similarities between sequences if the alignment was not properly made. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree was made with more robust methods using T-Coffee (default parameter, removed the unconserved sites by filtering the column scores < 4) for multiple sequence alignment and SMS-PhyML (default parameter, bootstrap = 1000, best model = LG +G) for ML (Maximum Likelihood) tree construction.

Their studies have confirmed that these DNA vaccines produce neutralizing antibodies in multiple experimental animal species and protected hamsters from HFRS (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) .

Next, they developed HFRS candidate DNA vaccines expressing HTNV or PUUV Gn and GC genes and evaluated them in an open-labeled single-center phase 1 study. The results showed that HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines prepared by electroporation were safe. When mixed together, the response to PUUV was greater than that to the HTNV DNA vaccine, and both DNA vaccines had immunogenicity .

The vaccine entered phase 2a trial in 2014 to compare the immune responses to two different doses, 1.0 and 2.0 mg, and mixed HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines in healthy participants. All groups also received booster doses 6 months after the first vaccination to determine which doses and vaccination plans will be the best way to advance the vaccine development process. To evaluate the safety, responsiveness and immunogenicity of an ANDV DNA vaccine to prevent HPS, the first phase I clinical trials of the ANDV DNA vaccine began in February 2019 1 ( Table 1) .

Similarly, all DNA vaccines developed against hantavirus target the M gene expressing the envelope GP (Gn and Gc) of hantaviruses ( Table 2 , part 1).

In the United States, a variety of DNA vaccines express the envelope glycoprotein gene of hantaviruses that were developed by Hopper's group (Schmaljohn et al., 2014) . In 1999, HFRS candidate naked DNA vaccine was constructed by the subcloning method. The subcloned cDNA represented the medium fragment The yield for all nucleocapsid proteins ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg per g wet weight of yeast cells Razanskiene et al., 2004 (Continued) Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org (M; encoding G 1 and G 2 glycoprotein) or small fragment (S; encoding nucleocapsid protein) of SEOV and was cloned into the expression vector WRG 7077. Syrian hamsters were vaccinated with the M or S vaccine with a gene gun, and hantavirus-specific antibodies were found in 5 of 5 hamsters or 4 of 5 hamsters, respectively. Evidence of infection was monitored after challenge with SEOV. Twenty-eight days later, hamsters vaccinated with M were protected hamsters from infection, but those inoculated with S were not protected (Hooper et al., 1999) . Then, HTNV M gene products G 1 and G 2 were expressed in 2001, and non-human primates were evaluated. The HTNV M gene has protective effects against HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV in hamsters. The HTNV and ANDV M genes can induce high level of neutralizing antibodies in rhesus monkeys (Hooper et al., 2001) . Next, a DNA vaccine plasmid containing the full-length M genome fragment of ANDV (pWRG/AND-M) was constructed . Rhesus monkeys inoculated with pWRG/AND-M with gene guns produced very high levels of neutralizing antibodies that neutralized not only ANDV but also other HCPS-related hantavirus strains, such as SNV. On the 4th or 5th day after injection, monkey serum protected 100% of hamsters from fatal diseases (Custer et al., 2003) .

Then the pWRG/HA-M plasmid containing the HTNV and ANDV M gene fragments was constructed. Rhesus monkeys were immunized with the pWRG/HA-M vaccine to produce antibodies binding to M gene products (G 1 and G 2 glycoproteins) and neutralize HTNV and ANDV. Subsequently, 1-2 years after the initial vaccination series, the neutralizing antibody titers induced by the double immunogen pWRG/HA-M or a single immunogen expressing only HTNV or ANDV Gp increased rapidly to a high level. This result is the first time that the hantavirus M gene DNA vaccine has been shown to elicit a strong memory response and stimulate an antibody response to neutralize HFRS and HCPS viruses (Hooper et al., 2006; Kwilas et al., 2014) detected the high-titer neutralizing antibody induced by an SNV/ANDV DNA vaccine encoding viral envelope Gp in laboratory animals and non-human primates (NHCPS). It can be delivered effectively using a disposable syringe injection (DSJI) system (Kwilas et al., 2014) . Brocato et al. (2013) cloned codon-optimized PUUV M fragments into DNA vaccine vectors to produce the plasmid pWRG/PUU-M, which can produce high-titer neutralizing antibodies in hamsters and NHCPs. The pWRG/PUU-M vaccine protects hamsters from PUUV infection and is not affected by DOBV infection. Unexpectedly, vaccination could protect hamsters in the absence of ANDV cross-neutralizing antibodies in a lethal ANDV disease model . Then, the authors tried to produce the pan-hantavirus vaccine with a mixed plasmid DNA vaccine. A study of ANDV hamster model showed that the neutralizing antibody produced by DNA vaccine technology can be used to resist the challenge of an SNV full-length M gene DNA vaccine to prevent the occurrence of HCPS. Rabbits vaccinated with SNV DNA vaccine with muscle electroporation (mEP) produced increased neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, hamsters vaccinated three times with the SNV DNA vaccine with a gene gun were completely free from SNV infection. Rabbits were vaccinated with HCPS mixture (ANDV and SNV plasmid), HFRS mixed (HTNV and PUUV plasmid), or HCPS/HFRS mixture (all four plasmids) by mEP. The results showed that the HCPS mixture and HFRS mixture produce neutralizing antibodies against ANDV/SNV and HTNV/PUUV, respectively. In addition, a mixture of HCPS/HFRS triggered neutralizing antibodies against all four viruses . Spik et al. (2008) reported that PUUV and HTNV DNA vaccines should serve as separate regulators. Both vaccines produced neutralizing antibodies when injected alone, but when they were administered as mixtures, only one of the two hantavirus antibodies could be detected. In contrast, if the DNA was administered to an animal as a separate vaccine, a reaction to both was observed. To improve the use of DNA vaccine, a multihead intradermal electroporation device was developed, which can be used to vaccinate with an increased dose of DNA vaccine to the skin.

The device will enable multiplasmid vaccine preparation to provide multiplasmid vaccine preparation without interference (Mackow et al., 2014) .

In China, a DNA vaccine targeting hantavirus Gn merges the antigen with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1), thereby changing the antigen presentation pathway and activating CD4 T cells. The LAMP 1 targeting strategy successfully enhanced the effectiveness of the HTNV Gn vaccine. Further studies showed that pVAX-LAMP/Gn established a memory response during long-term protection (6 months) in mice. Zhao et al. constructed a multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine-named the SHP chimeric gene, which contains 25 glycoprotein epitopes of SEOV, HTNV, and PUUV. The humoral and cellular responses were significantly enhanced in vaccinated BALB/c mice (Zhao et al., 2012) .

Subunit protein vaccines not only are safe and easy to produce but also do not easily cause interference between the components of a multivalent formulation Liang et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2018) . Because the N protein of hantavirus circulating in different continents can provide high cross-protection in animals, the N protein is considered to be an important part of a wide range of reactive vaccines against hantavirus infection (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2002) . Research has shown that recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rN) from PUUV, TOPV, ANDV, and DOBV could induce a cross-protective immune response to PUUV. The cross-reaction to PUUV antigen was the highest in the serum of animals immunized with ANDV rN, followed by that to TOPV and DOBV rN. In a proliferation test, T lymphocytes immunized with heterogenic rNs were effectively recalled by PUUV rN in vitro, as were animal T lymphocytes immunized with homologous proteins (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2002) . In addition, recombinant vaccinia virus carrying PUUV N or the first half of the G2 gene was constructed. Detection and cloning of PUUV-specific CTLs from PBMCs of patients with NE by recombinant PUUV vaccinia virus led to the isolation of an HLA-A24-restricted CTL cell line recognizing the G2 protein, and its 9-mer epitope was determined (Terajima et al., 2002) . Razanskiene et al. (2004) reported that the stability and high purity of NP of PUUV, DOBV, and HTNV ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/g wet weight of yeast cells. DOBV rN protein is a promising vaccine candidate protein that can induce N-specific antibodies, and its terminal titer is as high as 1:1,000,000 in C57BL/6 mice. The antibody induced by DOBV rN protein has a high cross-reaction with rN protein of PUUV and HTNV . It was found that there might be RNA fragment exchange between the two PUUV strains. N-linked glycosylation occurred at one site of Gn (N 142, N357, and N409) and GC (N 937), and a possible O-glycosylation site was identified in GC (T 985). The study of coding gene products is of great significance for the design of new vaccines (Johansson et al., 2004) . Schmidt et al. (2005) reports that NP of SEOV reacts with SEOV-specific monoclonal antibodies and some HTNV-and PUUV cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Rabbits immunized with recombinant NP can induce a high-titer antibody response, and NP-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of experimental infected rats and human exposed to hantavirus from different geographical sources. Yeast-expressed SEOV N protein represents a promising antigen for serological epidemiological research and vaccine development (Schmidt et al., 2005) . Antoniukas et al. (2006) reported that the biomass and the expression level of recombinant PUUV NP were increased by adding plant extract to YNB medium. The maximum volume yield of the N protein was 316 mg L −1 (Antoniukas et al., 2006) (Table 2 , part 2).

Virus-like particle vaccines are similar to natural virus particles but lack infectious genetic material. They are composed of repetitive viral structural proteins with inherent self-assembly characteristics (Yong et al., 2019) . How to improve the immunogenicity of VLPs is very important. It was reported that either CD40L-or GM-CSF-contained HTNV VLP expression in sf9 insect cells or CHO cells (Ying et al., 2016) could enhance the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. CD40L/GM-CSF incorporation into VLPs induced elevated levels of HTNV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in mice. The spleen cells of immunized mice had an enhanced ability to secrete IFN-γ and IL-2, increasing CTL activity . The GM-CSF and CD40L-containing VLPs expressed in a eukaryotic expression vector had a stable, long-term protective effect, with a high titer of neutralizing antibody, on mice within 6 months after immunization (Dong et al., 2019) . These results suggest that CD40L/GM-CSF-containing VLPs can be used as a potential candidate vaccine ( 

Hantaviruses primarily infect host capillary endothelial cells of various organs, especially those of kidneys and lungs, and could spark robust immune response in humans. The basic pathological feature of both old world hantaviruses causing HFRS and new world hantaviruses leading to HCPS is dramatically increased vascular permeability, the pathogenesis of which is highly involved in viral infection and excessive immune responses of the host. Extensive capillary leakage results in multiple clinical manifestations, such as hypotensive shock in HFRS and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in HCPS, which might deteriorate into multisystem organ failure. Currently, there are no approved post-exposure therapeutic countermeasures against hantaviral infection, but diversified treatment strategies, which target the viral life cycle, host immunological factors or patient clinical symptoms, have been developed and applied to manage HFRS or HCPS (see Table 3 ). Virus-targeting antivirals, including classical antiviral drugs, antibodies, or novel small molecules, are tested mainly to block hantavirus entry or restrain virus replication. Although several antivirals have been proven to be protective in vitro or in vivo, there still exist some problems for their clinical application. Host-targeting medicines are designed to improve vascular function or rebuild immune homeostasis, while their curative effects are still under debate. Supportive care is universally applied for HFRS or HCPS, and the specific treatments depend on clinical findings of different disease phases.

The viral entry process is composed of virus attachment or absorption on susceptible cells, penetration and subsequent uncoating, which is the first step for hantaviral life cycle. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) could interact with viral envelope proteins and disturb their binding with receptors on host cells, thus blocking viral attachment. During hantavirus infection, the Gn and Gc glycoproteins, but not nucleocapsid proteins (NP) are considered the major antigens in inducing NAb production (Jiang et al., 2016) . High levels of NAbs could be detected in the convalescent phase of HFRS or HCPS patients, and these NAbs could protect the individual from hantaviral infection and have been used as passive immunotherapy (Manigold and Vial, 2014; Jiang et al., 2016) . Presently, there are no reported clinical randomized controlled trials using NAbs in immunotherapy for HFRS or HCPS in humans. Most studies measure antibody efficacy through the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test at the cellular level, as well as animal experiments against lethal hantavirus challenge (sucking mice or newborn rat models for HTNV or SEOV infection and hamster models for ANDV or SNV infection) (Zhang et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2002; Manigold and Vial, 2014) . For old world hantaviruses, 13 crude Fab preparations directed to the PUUV Gc protein were generated from splenic lymphocytes of a PUUV-immune individual and exhibited type-specific neutralization of PUUV, with a 44-54% reduction in FRNT (de Carvalho Nicacio et al., 2000) . Anti-SR-11 (SEOV) rat serum applied 4 h before or 72 h after the challenge could protect against lethal SR-11 (SEOV) infection in newborn rats, and cross-protection effects were also found against KI-262 (SEOV) and 76-118 (HTNV) (Zhang et al., 1989) . In China, 18 murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting HTNV were prepared in our lab, among which 14 targeted NP, 4 reacted with Gc, and 1 recognized both NP and Gc. The Gc-related MAbs were active in the HI test and displayed high virus-neutralizing activity in vitro, and they could be regarded as HTNV NAbs. Consistently, administration of these NAbs within 48 hpi could protect suckling mice from lethal HTNV infection, indicating that NAbs might be a potentially treatment strategy for preexposure prophylaxis and postexposure therapy against HTNV infection (Xu et al., 2002) . Phase I clinical pharmacology and toxicity tests for HTNV NAbs in healthy volunteers were performed, and phase II clinical trials to assess the therapeutic efficacy of these NAbs in early stages of HFRS were carried out in endemic settings in China (Xu et al., 2002 (Xu et al., , 2009 . For new world hantaviruses, passive immunization with either patient-derived or vaccine-induced NAbs was capable of protecting against lethal ANDV challenge in hamsters (Manigold and Vial, 2014) . A non-randomized multicenter trial using plasma from HCPS convalescent patients for the treatment of acute HCPS has been carried out in Chile, showing that plasma containing high titers of NAbs against ANDV could significantly reduce case fatality rate from 32 to 14% (Vial et al., 2015) . Considering the limited availability of convalescent plasma from HCPS survivors, goose polyclonal antibodies were acquired from ANDV DNA vaccine, and the purified IgY/IgY Fc from egg yolks could protect hamsters from lethal ANDV infection. Recently, two NAbs, JL16 and MIB22, were developed from the ANDV GP-specific memory B cells of convalescent HCPS patients, both of which reached in a 100% protection rate against lethal ANDV challenge (Garrido et al., 2018) . Although NAbs from convalescent patient or immunized animals could obviously restrain hantaviral infection and improve disease outcome, purified human or humanized NAbs against hantaviruses with increased security and efficacy should be developed for clinical experiments. Additionally, research on broadly neutralizing antibodies against hantaviruses is still lacking. Hantaviral attachment or absorption could also be restrained by lactoferin (LF), an iron-binding glycoprotein that was reported to have broad antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. LF-pretreated Vero E6 cells showed a reduced number of SR-11 (SEOV) foci, while its antiviral effects were obviously compromised if the LF-pretreated cell monolayer was washed before SEOV infection (Murphy et al., 2000) . Further, LF could suppress viral shedding within 24 hpi, the effectiveness of which failed after 48 hpi (Murphy et al., 2001) . These results indicated that LF might adhere to cell surface and inhibit SEOV adsorption to host cells. Intriguingly, although LF could not inhibit the expression of NP and Gc, once hantaviral amplification was established in cells, LF contributed to higher survival rates, which might be due to LF-enhanced cytocidal function of natural killer (NK) cells (Murphy et al., 2001) . Even so, the specific mechanisms of how LF inhibits SEOV absorption and influences host immune responses, as well as the effects of LF on other species of hantaviruses, remain obscure.

Hantaviral fusion with cell membrane facilitates its entry process. The Hantavirus Gc envelope glycoprotein acts as a viral fusion protein that is essential for viral entry. It has been demonstrated that Gc shares similar features with class II fusion proteins, which means that three domains of viral fusion proteins are connected by a stem region anchoring in the viral envelope (Cifuentes-Munoz et al., 2011) . Exogenous protein fragments containing fusion protein domain III (DIII) and the stem region could bind to the core of the fusion protein and interfere with its conformation transition, inhibiting the membrane fusion process. Based on this effect, soluble recombinant peptides that mimic DIII and the stem region were prepared, and were proven to block both ANDV and PUUV infection in Vero E6 cells by blocking membrane fusion (Barriga et al., 2016) . The strategy using viral Gc DIII and stem fragments to suppress fusion might be feasible for other hantaviruses, while the protective effects in vivo still need further studies to confirm.

Furthermore, antivirals targeting hantaviral receptors have been synthesized. It has been demonstrated that pathogenic hantaviruses attach to the cell surface via host-specific α IIb β 3 orα v β 3 integrins while non-pathogenic hantaviruses initiate cellular entry relying on α v β 1 integrins (Jiang et al., 2016) . Based on the structure of cyclic peptides known to bind the α v β 3 receptor, a few of cyclic peptides or small molecules were designed and screened for their antihantaviral function. The cyclic nonapeptides CLVRNLAWC and CQATTARNC could inhibit SNV and ANDV infection in vitro (Hall et al., 2008) . After two rounds of biological screening, the peptidomimetic compounds 8012-0652, C481-1256, and G319-0078 were screened out with potency in the nanomolar range against infection of a panel of hantaviruses, including SNV, ANDV, and HTNV (Hall et al., 2010) . Further studies should be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these small molecules in vivo.

Viral proteins are the working molecules for viral biosynthesis, among which RdRp plays an important role in hantaviral transcription and replication and is considered a desirable drug target. The pyrazine derivative Favipiravir and the nucleoside analogs Ribavirin (RBV) and ETAR have been tested effective antihantaviral drugs that directly or indirectly affect the biological function of RdRp. Favipiravir (Avigan; T-705) was initially discovered in 2002 as an antiviral drug selectively inhibiting the RdRp of influenza virus and then reported to have a high activity against a panel of Bunyaviruses (Gowen et al., 2007; Westover et al., 2016) . Favipiravir could attenuate the viral RNA replication level and decrease the progeny virus yield of SNV and ANDV in vitro. In vivo studies, including non-lethal SNV challenged and lethal ANDV challenged hamster model, demonstrated that oral administration favipiravir at the dosage of 100 mg/kg twice daily could prominently reduce viral load in hamster serum and various organs and resulted in 100% survival in the ANDV lethal infection model (Safronetz et al., 2013) . Delayed favipiravir administration after the onset of viremia exerted no protective effects against ANDV infection. Notably, there is no reported clinical trial with favipiravir as an antiviral treatment in HFRS and HCPS.

RBV and ETAR are nucleoside analogs that interfere with viral replication. They can inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and reduce the synthesis GTP de novo, hence affecting the function of viral RdRp. As a potent mutagen, RBV could induce RNA mutagenesis in subsequent generations of HTNV virions (Chung et al., 2013) , while it is not expected that ETAR induces mutation, probably due to the lack of pseudobase pair presence (Chung et al., 2008) . Additionally, RBV was reported to modulate host immune responses by suppressing interleukin-10-producing regulatory T cells (Kobayashi et al., 2012) , while there is no evidence showing that ETAR could exert immunoregulatory effects (Szabo, 2017) . Both in vitro and in vivo antihantaviral activity of RBV and ETAR have been confirmed by a series of studies. For HFRS therapy, RBV-treated suckling mice had a higher survival rate upon HTNV infection than the placebo control group (Huggins et al., 1986) . In China, a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 242 HFRS patients caused by HTNV infection. The result showed that postexposure administration of RBV could decrease mortality by sevenfold and reduce the risk of entering the oliguric phase, suggesting that RBV is effective against HTNV-induced HFRS (Huggins et al., 1991) . However, a clinical trial for HFRS caused by PUUV infection in Russia showed that RBV could not improve patient condition, especially reducing viral load, and that RBV could increase the occurrence of side effects of RBV, including rash, sinus bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, and reduced hemoglobin. These data suggested insufficient efficacy and safety of RBV in the treatment of HFRS caused by PUUV (Malinin and Platonov, 2017) . For HCPS treatment, two studies confirmed that RBV could protect hamsters from lethally intraperitoneal or intranasal ANDV challenge without toxicity, and even abbreviated treatment regimens from 7 days to 3 days worked if therapy commenced 1 day following virus challenge (Safronetz et al., 2011; Ogg et al., 2013) . Unfortunately, two clinical trials for the treatment of HCPS using RBV did not show any improvement in survival rates compared with those for patients during the same time frame or receiving placebo treatment. It is speculated that RBV treatment might be ineffective once HCPS progresses to the cardiopulmonary phase. ETAR showed an EC(50) value of 10 and 4.4 µmol/L for HTNV and ANDV in Vero E6 cells, respectively, which is much lower than its toxic dosage of 880 µmol/L (Chung et al., 2008) . Moreover, ETAR administration in sucking mice with a dosage of 12.5 or 25 mg/kg at 10 days post HTNV infection could significantly increase the survival rate from 10 to 25%, an effect equal to that of RBV (Chung et al., 2008) . To date, there were no studies on the antiviral activity of ETAR on other hantaviruses. Hantaviral NP could bind to an evolutionary conserved sequence at the 5 terminus of hantaviral genomic RNA. The interaction of NP with the viral genome could protect viral RNA from host recognition and degradation, facilitate the N-mediated viral RNA translation process, and help package the viral genome into nucleocapsids. Several compounds, namely, lead inhibitor K31, K34, and 103772, were reported to interrupt the NP-RNA interaction against SNV and ANDV infection. They could abrogate both viral RNA synthesis and translation without affecting the normal biological process of host cells, among which K31 showed antiviral activity similar to that of RBV (Salim et al., 2016) . However, K31 failed to affect the replication of HIV or adenovirus, demonstrating its selectivity for hantaviruses. Arbidol, an immunomodulator developed in Russia, was also found to protect against HTNV infection both in vivo and in vitro (Deng et al., 2009) .

Targeting viral RNAs is the most direct and effective way to curb hantaviral replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against hantaviral genes could facilitate viral RNA clearance based on the RNA interfering (RNAi) mechanisms and has been tested as a potential antiviral strategy in vitro and in vivo. It has been demonstrated that siRNAs targeting the S, M, or L segment of ANDV could reduce viral replication in Vero E6 cells or human lung microvascular endothelial cells and that an S-targeted siRNA pool seemed to be more efficient in reducing viral transcription and replication than M-or L-targeted siRNA in Vero E6 cells. Importantly, these siRNAs could inhibit ANDV replication even if given after infection (Chiang et al., 2014) . Although siRNAs could effectively suppress hantavirus amplification in host cells most likely through promoting viral RNA clearance, their antiviral activity might be greatly compromised considering their poor biological stability and targeting ability in vivo. One strategy is to combine siRNAs targeting encoding sequences of HTNV genome with recombinant antibodies (3G1-Cκ-tP) recognizing HTNV Gc, which were applied by intraperitoneal injection in an HTNVinduced encephalitis mouse model. The result indicated that through combination, siRNAs could be specifically delivered to the HTNV-infected brain cells and protect against HTNV intracranial infection . On all accounts, novel delivery system should be developed to ensure the stability and selectivity of siRNAs, and the efficacy and safety of these systems remained unclear for the treatment of HFRS or HCPS.

Increased capillary leakage due to hantaviral infection is the basic pathogenic feature for both HFRS and HCPS. Therefore, treatment strategies improving microvascular endothelial cell function seem to be feasible in mitigating disease severity and reducing mortality (Alkharsah, 2018) . Hantavirus-disturbed vascular function is a multifactorial event whose complicated mechanisms still need to be elucidated, and two kinds of hypothesis have been developed. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) theory was first proposed and studied in depth. VEGF binding to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) could activate SFK (Src family kinases) signaling, which may result in dissociation, internalization, and degradation of VEcadherin. Altered expression and localization of VE-cadherin contributed to impaired barrier structure of adherent junctions, which could lead to incremental cellular permeability (Jiang et al., 2016) . It has been demonstrated HTNV or ANDV infection could disrupt the interaction of β3 integrin with VEGFR2 and induce VEGFR2 hyper phosphorylation, which may enhance the permeability of infected endothelial cells by sensitizing them to VEGF (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012) . As increased VEGF content has been noted in the plasma of HFRS and HCPS patients and is closely related to disease severity in the acute phase (Bird et al., 2016; Pal et al., 2018) , it is feasible to repurpose those FDA-approved drugs targeting vasoactive mediators for use as hantaviral infection therapy. In line with this strategy, one study reported that the VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor, as well as SFK inhibitors, could obviously stabilize ANDV-induced endovascular permeability, among which the SFK inhibitors dasatinib and pazopanib blocked VE-cadherin dissociation by more 90% (Gorbunova et al., 2011) . Another study also indicated that application of vandetanib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor preventing VEGFR2 phosphorylation, before ANDV infection could delay animal lethality and increase total survival by 23% in ANDV-challenged hamsters (Bird et al., 2016) . In contrast, similar small molecules administered after the onset of viremia failed to protect hamsters from lethal ANDV challenge (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . Moreover, some other small molecules, such as angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), were found to inhibit hantavirus-directed endothelial cell permeability in vitro (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2008) , while further research in vivo should be performed to confirm their efficacy.

Another promising theory is increased activation of the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS) during hantavirus infection. One study using a model with co-cultured endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells demonstrated that activation of KKS and subsequent liberation of bradykinin (BK), but not VEGF, were mainly responsible for the dramatic increase in endothelial cell permeability after hantavirus infection (Taylor et al., 2013) . BK, a nonapeptide that binds BK type 2 receptor, could induce blood vessel dilatation and vascular permeability increase, resulting in collapsed blood pressure. Icatibant is a peptidomimetic drug that can block the interaction of BK with the BK type 2 receptor by binding to this receptor itself. One case reported that a 37-yearold male who once underwent splenectomy due to congenital spherocytosis manifested with severe capillary leakage syndrome caused by PUUV infection. With a single dose of icatibant, the condition of the patient stabilized, followed by gradual improvement and full recovery (Antonen et al., 2013) . Another case report also confirmed the efficient treatment of icatibant in a 67-year-old female HFRS patient (Laine et al., 2015) . These clinical data indicated that BK receptor antagonist might be a novel treatment strategy for hantavirus diseases. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that the foresaid two patients had spleen abnormalities, which might be related to the curative effect of icatibant. Clinical trials enrolling a large number of HFRS or HCPS patients should be performed to further identify the remedy effects of bradykinin receptor antagonists.

It is wildly accepted that HFRS and HCPS are caused by uncontrolled systemic inflammatory responses, in which multiple inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α, IL-8, and RANTES, contributed to disease progression (Manigold and Vial, 2014; Schonrich and Raftery, 2017) ; however, immunoregulation treatment in HFRS or HCPS is undesirable. A recent study with depletion of alveolar macrophages, which are considered the main resource for proinflammatory responses, could not prevent ANDV-caused pathogenesis in hamsters (Hammerbeck et al., 2016) . The immunomodulatory treatment of corticoids was firstly performed during the Korean war, but the case fatality rate was not improved (Sayer et al., 1955) . In Chile, a retrospective analysis suggested that a high dose of methylprednisolone could reduce mortality in 22 HCPS patients (Brocato and Hooper, 2019) . However, a double-blind clinical trial in Chile failed to observe a significantly improved outcome between methylprednisolone recipients and placebo recipients for HCPS. Similarly, another randomized prospective study did not show any benefit from corticosteroid treatment in HFRS patients (Qian et al., 1990) .

The initiation of careful observation and prompt but judicious supportive treatment is crucial to improve patient survival condition for both HFRS and HCPS (Sargianou et al., 2012) . It has been demonstrated that admission to the ICU and supportive treatment could greatly reduce the mortality rate of HFRS (Huggins et al., 1991) . In general, the treatment principle for HFRS patients is using intravenous hydration and electrolyte therapy to maintain physiological blood pressure. Platelet transfusions can be applied to reduce the mortality in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) is the first choice to improve uremia condition and rectify kidney dysfunction in patients with acute kidney injury. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) should be applied for those critical HFRS patients, especially when they have a complication, such as multi-organ injury pulmonary edema, or cerebropathy (Jiang et al., 2016) . Treatment of patients with HCPS should also be performed in the ICU with continuous cardiac monitoring and respiratory support. The palliative treatments for HCPS usually include mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and hemofiltration (Sargianou et al., 2012) .

HFRS and HCPS caused by hantavirus infection are reemerging infectious diseases that greatly threaten global public health. At present, there are currently no US FDA-approved treatments or vaccines available; only the whole virus-inactivated vaccine against HTNV or SEOV is available in China and Korea. With the implementation of intervention measures, the incidence of hantavirus infections seems to have shown a decline in recent years. In China and Korea, the number of HFRS cases has been drastically reduced. But the vaccines elicit suboptimal immune responses, confer inadequate protection, and may cause safety concerns. In 2017, the recurrence of global outbreak of HFRS has drawn renewed attention to this old disease, which seriously threatens human health. HFRS in China was still a natural focal disease with relatively high morbidity and fatality, and its distribution and epidemic trends had also changed. Surveillance measures, together with prevention and control strategies, should be improved and strengthened to reduce HFRS infection in China. Therefore, the best solution is to develop a functional vaccine to prevent hantavirus infection. Among the three types of vaccines discussed above, only DNA vaccine candidates have progressed to clinical trials. Subunit protein vaccines not only are safe and easy to produce but also do not easily cause interference between the components of a multivalent formulation Liang et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2018) . To resolve the above problems, we propose to construct a universal genetic engineering novel subunit protein vaccine against HTNV and SEOV by combining bioinformatics methods, viral surface protein structure biology knowledge, and molecular biology tools. Antiviral treatment only works when applied during the early infection stage, possibly because uncontrolled immune responses occur and predominate the pathogenesis process post-acute infection. Immunomodulatory therapy hardly improves the patient survival rate, possibly because suppressed inflammatory responses inhibit prompt viral clearance and enhance virus-caused injury increase. Therefore, based on rapid supportive care, effectively combining antiviral treatment and immunomodulatory therapy is a potential strategy for HFRS and HPS. 3G1 and 3D8, the mice MAbs against HTNV developed by our team, have been used for HFRS treatment and the result indicated that application of 3G1 and 3D8 at early stage of disease could significantly improve the patient condition and increase survival rates, especially for those severe or critical HFRS patients (data unpublished). Hence, NAbs might be the most promising treatment for HFRS or HPS, and the effective humanized neutralizing antibodies should be further developed.

Moreover, it is universally acknowledged that type I IFN responses are essential for hosts to defend against hantaviral infection. Multiple IFN stimulated genes (ISG) were confirmed to have antihantaviral activity. The interferon-induced MxA protein, a GTPase with extensive antiviral activity, notably against influenza viruses, was reported to inhibit HTNV and PUUV replication in Vero cells (Frese et al., 1996) . The interferoninduced IFITM3 protein was able to inhibit HTNV infection in both HUVEC and A549 cells by inhibiting virus entry (Xu-Yang et al., 2016) . Several studies have shown that pretreatment with type I IFN could effectively inhibit hantaviral infection. Pretreating endothelial cells (ECs) with IFNα blocks hantavirus replication, and this inhibitory effect is still observed when IFNα is added to ECs within 12 hpi; however, the addition of IFNα 15-24 h after infection had little effect on hantavirus replication. Clinical data indicated that IFN treatment is only effective prophylactically or shortly after hantavirus infection. In fact, during the natural infection process, compared with nonpathogenic hantaviruses, pathogenic hantaviruses could inhibit host IFN production at an early infection stage, but the specific mechanism remains ambiguous. Our team recently found that HTNV could induce complete autophagy at an early phase, which promotes host MAVS degradation and disturbs RIG-I-MAVS signaling-mediated IFN production. The application of autophagy inhibitors, including 3-MA and CQ, could significantly enhance type I IFN responses and inhibit HTNV replication both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that lncRNA NEAT1 could positively regulate RIG-I-DDX60mediated IFN responses during HTNV infection and that overexpression of NEAT1 could restrain HTNV amplification both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that enhancing host IFN responses during the early infection phase may be a novel therapeutic strategy for HFRS and HCPS, while there is still much work to be done to translate basic medicine research to clinical practice.

molecules Pharmacological and Biological Antiviral Therapeutics for Cardiac Coxsackievirus Infections,"Subtype B coxsackieviruses (CVB) represent the most commonly identified infectious agents associated with acute and chronic myocarditis, with CVB3 being the most common variant. Damage to the heart is induced both directly by virally mediated cell destruction and indirectly due to the immune and autoimmune processes reacting to virus infection. This review addresses antiviral therapeutics for cardiac coxsackievirus infections discovered over the last 25 years. One group represents pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances that inhibit virus uptake by binding to the virus capsid (e.g., pleconaril) or inactivate viral proteins (e.g., NO-metoprolol and ribavirin) or inhibit cellular proteins which are essential for viral replication (e.g., ubiquitination inhibitors). A second important group of substances are interferons. They have antiviral but also immunomodulating activities. The third and most recently discovered group includes biological and cellular therapeutics. Soluble receptor analogues (e.g., sCAR-Fc) bind to the virus capsid and block virus uptake. Small interfering RNAs, short hairpin RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides bind to and led to degradation of the viral RNA genome or cellular RNAs, thereby preventing their translation and viral replication. Most recently mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has been shown to possess antiviral activity in CVB3 infections. Taken together, a number of antiviral therapeutics has been developed","Myocarditis is defined as a subclinical inflammation of the heart muscle and may be induced by infectious, toxic or immunologic agents. Among the different infectious pathogens viruses are the most common causes of myocarditis [1] and serological studies, nucleic-acid hybridization and PCR-based studies of endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy specimens have shown that enteroviruses represent one of the most common groups of viruses detected in the myocardium [2] . Although myocarditis is a frequent disease, it often goes unrecognized. Based on more than 12,500 randomly selected routine autopsies performed over a 10 year period about 1% of the population were found to have lymphocytic myocarditis [3] . In most cases myocarditis is detected in the group of young adults between the ages of 20 and 39 [4] .

Coxsackieviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and the genus enterovirus. The viruses have a positive-stranded RNA genome of about 7.4 kb encoding a monocistronic polyprotein [5] which is processed into mature peptides during translation by viral proteases [6] . Four capsid proteins (VP1 to VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) are found during coxsackievirus infection of cells [7] . Based on different organ tropism and differences in organ damage observed in mice, coxsackieviruses can be classified into two groups. The group A coxsackieviruses (CVA) has 23 members, whereas the group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) has only six members [8, 9] . Coxsackieviruses commonly induce mild disease, but under some circumstances, which seem to depend on genetic and individual predispositions, the viruses overcome local host defenses and can induce severe infections of the heart, pancreas, and brain [9] . The CVB group includes serotypes, in particular CVB3, that are frequently associated with infections of the heart. The course of CVB3 heart infections in patients may be different. Typically CVB3 induces acute myocardial infections and, in most cases, patients undergo a complete recovery. Fulminant infections, however, can occur and can result in sudden death. If the virus cannot be eliminated by host immune defense mechanisms, a persistant CVB3 infection and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the leading causes for heart transplantation, can be developed. The incidence of enteroviral infections in the hearts of patients with myocarditis and DCM is variable but infection rates of up to 40% have been observed [2, 10, 11] . Although DCM has multiple causes, there is evidence that 30% of DCM patients are infected with enteroviruses [12, 13] .

The pathogenic mechanisms of CVB3 induced myocarditis are yet not fully understood. That enteroviruses play an active role in development of myocarditis in humans, especially in fulminant and acute courses of infections, is supported by detection of enteroviral replicative intermediates (minus-strand enteroviral RNA) in 50% of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and suspected clinical myocarditis [10] . In contrast, in patients with idiopathic DCM and chronic coronary disease (CCD), representing end-stage cardiac diseases, 36% and 33% of the patients were positive for enterovirus genomes, but only a small percentage (6.5%) of them had an active enteroviral replication in the myocardium. Moreover, no fully replicative virus could be isolated from myocardium of the patients [14] . In chronic heart infections, coxsackieviruses persist in a latent form and animal models have shown that virus persistence can result from production of stable double-stranded RNA [15] or is associated with deletions in the 5'-non-translated region of the viral genome [16] . Based on these observations, it was important to determine whether replication deficient coxsackievirus variants are able to induce DCM. To prove this Wessely et al. generated transgenic mice that expressed a replication restricted CVB3 cDNA exclusively in the heart. These animals expressed the coxsackieviral genomes in their cardiomyocytes at low-level without forming infectious virus particles. Histopathological analysis of transgenic hearts revealed typical morphologic features of myocardial interstitial fibrosis and degeneration of myocytes, resembling DCM in humans. Functionally these changes were accompanied by decreased systolic functions and excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities similar to pressure overload models of DCM [17] . Thus, this study confirmed that non-replicative coxsackieviruses are sufficient to induce DCM.

Studies in in vitro and in vivo models carried out over the last 25 years have contributed significantly to elucidating important aspects of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of the cardiac coxsackievirus infection. Based on these studies, it is clear that both direct virus induced injury as well as immune and autoimmune mechanisms triggered by viral infection are involved in development of coxsackievirus induced myocarditis [18, 19] . The impact of direct virus induced cytotoxicity is supported by the fact that CVB3 RNA is detected at all stages of CVB3 heart infections [20] and that the virus replication correlates with negative clinical outcome, suggesting that continued replication of the virus is involved in the progression of the disease [21] . Furthermore, it has been shown that enterovirus induced cytotoxicity is directly related to expression of viral proteins. CVB3 expresses two viral proteases, 2A and 3C. Both can induce apoptosis through activation of the extrinsic caspase-8-mediated pathway and the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway [22] . The protease 2A also cleaves the eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) eIF4GI and eIF4GII, leading to cessation of host protein synthesis [23, 24] and is able to cleave dystrophin in CVB3 infected cultured myocytes and in infected mouse hearts [25, 26] . The latter is thought to play a role in release of the virus from the myocyte [27] since viral infection is increased in the absence of dystrophin [28] . More importantly, impaired dystrophin functions lead to the disruption of the extra-sarcomeric cytoskeleton and loss of transmission of mechanical force to the extracellular matrix [29, 30] which seem to be important factors contributing to the development of DCM [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Although therapeutic approaches aiming at modulation or inhibition of the immune system, such as immunoglobulin therapy, immunoabsoption or specific antibody therapy hold also promise for the treatment of myocardial enteroviral infections [35] [36] [37] , this review will focus on direct pharmacological and biological therapies targeting specific points of the virus replication cycle to inhibit coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis.

Infection and replication of any virus, including CVB3, starts with interaction of the virus and its cellular receptor on the host cell, and ends with the release of viral progeny. Every step during this life cycle is a potential target for inhibiting viral infection. Based on their targets, pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances that are able to selectively inhibit the replication of coxsackieviruses can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of small molecules witch interfere with the viral capsid and prevent attachment/internalization or uncoating of the virion in the host cell. Substances of the second group inhibit viral replication by directly interfering with viral proteins and those of the third group interact with cellular proteins which play an important role in viral replication.

The first essential step of viral infection is the interaction of the viral capsid with the receptor on the surface of the host cell. Coxsackievirus capsids are assembled from 60 identical protomers, each composed of the four structural proteins VP1-VP4. The viral shell is formed by VP1 to VP3, and VP4 lies on the inner surface and establishes a connection between the capsid and the RNA genome [7] .

The surface of the virion shows a five-fold axis of symmetry, surrounded by a large depression termed the ""canyon"" which contains a hydrophobic pocket [38] . The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is the primary receptor of CVB [39, 40] and its binding to the pocket on the canyon floor of CVB mediates the internalization of the virus into the host cell [41] .

Several drugs have been developed that selectively inhibit the interaction of CVB with CAR. The WIN compounds are antiviral drugs interacting with the hydrophobic pocket at the bottom of the canyon [42] ( Figure 1 ). They were discovered initially by the Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute and first used for inhibition of rhinovirus infections [43] . These small molecules inhibit interaction of the virion with the cellular receptor molecule and thus prevent virus binding to the target cell receptors [44] . Furthermore, binding of specific WIN molecules in the pocket results in an increase in protein rigidity and stabilizes the entire viral capsid against enzymatic degradation so that uncoating and release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm is prevented [45] [46] [47] . In the last 25 years many WIN based drugs have been tested regarding their inhibitory effects against different members of the picornavirus family such as rhinovirus [48] , poliovirus [49] , echovirus [50] , and enterovirus [51] . WIN 54954, a broad-spectrum anti-picornaviral drug, was one of the first WIN compounds to be clinically tested. Its effectiveness against human rhinovirus, echovirus 9 and also enterovirus infections has been shown in vitro and in vivo [51] [52] [53] [54] . In vitro studies demonstrated that WIN 54954 can reduce picornavirus titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude [51, 52] . In vivo administration in mice experimentally infected with CVB3 led to a reduction of the proportion of cardiomyocytes containing viral RNA by about 90% and significantly inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis [55] . Moreover, administration of the drug resulted in complete protection against mortality of CVB3 in infected mice [56] . The latter study revealed that a strong decrease of virus induced mortality occurred when the treatment was started concomitant with CVB3 infection. When onset of therapy was delayed for one day, 85% survival was observed, whereas in the non-treatment group no animal survived, demonstrating significant, if no longer complete, protection from the virus. A therapeutic effect was still notable when treatment was initiated 4 days after virus inoculation [57] . Thus WIN 54954 therapy was almost fully effective within 24 hours after CVB3 infection, but the beneficial effect declined over time [57] . WIN 54954 treatment did not, however, abrogate the inflammatory reaction in the myocardium in CVB3 infected animals [55, 56] . As shown in a phase 1 clinical trial against rhinovirus infections and in a myocarditis model of mice infected with coxsackievirus A9, low doses of WIN 54954 were well tolerated [53, 58] . At higher doses of 100 to 200 mg/kg/day, however, neurological toxicity was observed in the murine myocarditis model in vivo [53] . Moreover, the compound is rapidly metabolized and induces reversible hepatitis, which made this compound uninteresting for further studies in the end [59] . WIN 63843 (pleconaril) represents a novel, orally available, systemically-acting compound of the WIN series with a high oral bio-availability and long plasma half-life. The compound has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against clinical isolates and prototypic strains of enteroviruses, including CVB1-CVB5, in vitro [60, 61] . Pleconaril has been more extensively evaluated in clinical studies than any other anti-picornavirus drug and shows clear efficacy in the treatment of various picornavirus-associated illnesses, whereas side effects are rare [4, [62] [63] [64] . In one study Rotbart et al. investigated the therapeutic response after pleconaril treatment in a follow up study in 38 patients with potentially life-threatening enterovirus infections. About 80% of the patients had a clinical response temporally associated with pleconaril therapy and to a similar degree patients showed virological, laboratory and radiological responses [4] . Clinical trials, however, revealed that therapeutic efficacy of pleconaril depends on the virus species targeted. A significant therapeutic effect was apparent during treatment of rhinovirus and several enterovirus infections [59, 65, 66] . In 2002 the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA declined to approve pleconaril for treatment of the common cold, as the panel remained unconvinced about the drug's safety profile [67] . Pleconaril has not yet been used in clinical trials explicitly for the treatment of enterovirus induced myocarditis. In vivo studies carried out by Pevear et al., however, demonstrated an efficient antiviral efficacy of the compound in enterovirus induced mouse myocarditis. Mice showed reduced mortality and a reduction of the CVB3 titer in the heart by about 4 to 7 orders of magnitude [60] .

Several studies demonstrated naturally occurring mutants resistant to pleconaril and, moreover, pleconaril treatment seems to result in rapid emergence of resistant CVB3 mutants [68, 69] . Such mutants predominantly contain a single amino acid substitution, Ile-1092 Leu/Met in the hydrophobic pocket of the canyon which prevents efficient binding of the compound, while it does not impair binding of the virus to cellular receptors [69] . In order to overcome virus resistance, new pleconaril derivatives have recently been synthesized and successfully tested against pleconaril-resistant mutants [70] .

In the last few years several additional new drugs have been developed which are functionally similar to the WIN compounds and have good antiviral efficacy against rhinovirus infection but less activity against coxsackievirus infections [71] . Thus, the search for more potent, highly bio-available compounds with a broad antiviral spectrum and high efficacy goes on.

The second class of picornavirus inhibitors comprises drugs that interfere with viral proteins during replication. These compounds interact with non-structural proteins, viral proteases or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and thereby inhibit viral replication in infected cells. A series of compounds, such guanidine hypochloride, HBB, MRL-1237 and TBZE-029 interact with the viral protein 2C, resulting in inhibition of the viral RNA synthesis and leading to protection of cells from virus-induced cell lysis [71, 72] (Figure 2 ). Their antiviral activity against coxsackieviruses was only investigated in in vitro experiments. These experiments, however, revealed that a single mutation in the viral 2C protein is sufficient to confer resistance against the antiviral treatment [71] . Nitric oxide (NO) donors form another class of molecules which interfere with the functions of viral non-structural proteins ( Figure 2 ). They inhibit enterovirus proteases 2A and 3C by S-nitrosylation [73, 74] . Both proteases are involved in host cell shut-off and lead to the development of the cytopathic effects [75] [76] [77] . The NO donors GTN and ISDN are able to inhibit coxsackievirus proteases and induce a significant antiviral effect in vitro. Furthermore, GTN significantly reduced signs of myocarditis after administration by decreasing immune cell infiltration and virus-induced fibrosis up to day 14 post-infection (p.i.) [78] . In another study the NO-donor was NO-metoprolol, a novel NO-releasing derivative of the β1-selective adrenergic receptor agonist metoprolol. It has been shown that metoprolol improves the survival, remodeling, fibrosis and left ventricular systolic function in a knock-in mouse model for inherited dilated cardiomyopathy [79] . In the CVB3 myocarditis mouse model treatment with NO-metoprolol displays an enhanced therapeutic benefit compared to metoprolol, with significant reduction of viral RNA copy numbers, body weight loss, infiltration and fibrosis score [80] .

Several nucleoside analogues were analyzed with respect to their anti-picornaviral potency. The most intensively studied drug is ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside, structurally related to inosine and guanosine. When ribavirin is incorporated into viral RNA it induces mutations that can be lethal for the virus (Figure 2 ). It has been shown that ribavirin has a broad antiviral activity against several RNA viruses in vivo, e.g., RSV, measles, lassa, and hepatitis C viruses [81] [82] [83] . In vitro activity of ribavirin against enteroviruses has been demonstrated by several groups [84] [85] [86] , and treatment of murine CVB3 myocarditis led to significantly decreased myocardial virus titer, inflammation, necrosis and myocardial calcification [86] . One side effect of ribavirin treatment, however, is hemolytic anemia [87] , so ribavirin may be contraindicated in patients with acute and chronic myocarditis. In a further study, Harki et al. synthesized cytidine analogues and evaluated them for antiviral activity. One of the tested molecules, a 5-nitrocytidine, decreased viral titer in CVB3 infected cells with 12-fold higher efficiency than ribavirin, but so far the results of in vivo studies, if any, have not been reported [88] .

A third group of antiviral drugs includes molecules which interact with cellular proteins and thereby interfere with viral replication. Several studies have shown that ubiquitination is required for effective replication of different viruses, among them coxsackievirus [89] [90] [91] . The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major intracellular pathway for protein degradation, with over 80% of cellular proteins being recycled through this pathway. UPS thus plays a key role in the regulation of a variety of fundamental cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, antigen processing, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair [92] [93] [94] . In the last few years several inhibitory substances targeting the UPS were analyzed for their ability to inhibit coxsackievirus infections ( Figure 2 ). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa, reduced coxsackieviral RNA synthesis, protein expression and progeny release up to 170-fold and 20-fold, respectively, in vitro [95, 96] . Other UPS-inhibitors, the peptide-aldehyde MG132 and lactacystin, reduced CVB3 infectivity in the murine cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 and increased cell viability [90] . Treatment of CVB3 infected mice with the proteasome inhibitor MLN353, however, resulted in an only slight decrease of viral-induced mortality and myocardial injury. Significant inhibition of viral replication in the heart was not detectable [97] . Although UPS inhibitors may be potential therapeutic tools for treatment coxsackievirus infection their relatively low efficiency and possible drug-induced side effects may limit their use for treatment of coxsackievirus infections in humans.

In summary, over the last 25 years many pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances have been developed, concomitant with the improvement of our knowledge of picornavirus structure and replication cycle. Adverse properties in bio-availability and safety of these drugs, rapid development of escape mutants and, in part, low efficacy currently limits their use in treatment of myocardial coxsackieviral infections in humans.

Interferons (IFNs) belong to the group of the cytokines and have antiviral and immunomodulating activities. Suspected from early investigations demonstrating the release of cytokines from CVB3 infected human monocytes [98] , the role of IFNs in CVB3 infections became obvious when IFN-β knockout mice proved to be highly susceptible to CVB3 infections and developed a breakdown and disruption of cardiomyocytes [99] .

In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of IFN treatment for coxsackievirus infections of the heart. Heim et al. showed antiviral activity of recombinant IFN-β and IFN-γ and ribavirin and natural human IFN-α co-treatment in a CVB3 carrier state infection of cultured human myocardial fibroblasts in vitro [85, 100] . In another study, Wang et al. confirmed antiviral and cardio-protective efficacy of murine IFN-β and IFN-α 2 in an CVB3 induced mice myocarditis model in vivo [101] . The potency of IFNs for treatment of myocardial enteroviral infections in humans was demonstrated several years ago. Twenty-two patients with entero-or adenoviral myocardial persistence were treated with IFN-β over a period of six months. Enteroviral genomes were eliminated from all patients. The viral clearance was paralleled by a significant decrease of left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameters of the heart and by an improvement of left ventricular function. Moreover, IFN-β was well tolerated in this study. Patients only showed flu-like side effects during the first 3 weeks of IFN-β treatment that could be efficiently suppressed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Further investigations of the therapeutic potential of IFN-β are currently being carried out in an ongoing multicenter randomized Betaferon ® (Bayer Schering Pharma AG) study in patients with chronic viral cardiomyopathy (BICC study) [102] .

Antisense approaches have proven to be promising strategies to inhibit viruses. Conventional antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded molecules composed of DNA monomers and modified variants thereof. These antisense oligonucleotides bind to a complementary (virus) RNA and prevent its translation or induce its degradation by RNase H [103] . The only antisense oligonucleotide that has been approved by the regulatory authorities to date is fomivirsen, a phosphorothioate-modified DNA oligonucleotide which was used to treat retinitis induced by cytomegalovirus, but was discontinued since the drug's market shrank [104] .

Antisense oligonucleotides have also been considered as novel tools to inhibit CVB3. In an initial screening, seven antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the 5' and 3' UTR of CVB3 and evaluated with respect to their antiviral activity in HeLa cells [105] . Phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were used that are resistant to degradation by cellular nucleases. Efficient virus inhibition was achieved with antisense oligonucleotides directed against either of the two untranslated regions. The most efficient antisense molecule targeting the 3' UTR was subsequently used to inhibit CVB3 in HL-1 cells and in vivo [106] . This antisense oligonucleotide strongly inhibited viral RNA and protein synthesis in cell culture and its intravenous administration into A/J mice decreased the viral titer by 0.5 log 10 . To improve the in vivo delivery, a cell-penetrating arginine-rich peptide was conjugated to a morpholino oligomer [107] . Since morpholino oligomers do not induce RNase H cleavage of the target RNA, their mechanism of action is based on a steric blockade of the target RNA function. Intravenous administration of the oligomer once prior to and once after CVB3 infection resulted in an enhanced, approximately 2 order of magnitude decrease in viral titer and in significantly less damage to cardiac tissue.

A decade ago short double-stranded RNA molecules were found to efficiently inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells [108] . These so-called small or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are usually 21 nucleotides in length, 19 of which form a duplex. After introduction into cells, siRNAs elicit efficient induction of post transcriptional gene silencing known as RNA interference (RNAi). They are incorporated into a multimeric protein complex named RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). While one of the two RNA strands is discarded, the antisense strand guides RISC to the complementary target RNA and induces its endonucleolytic cleavage (Figure 3) . Comparative studies revealed a significantly higher efficacy of RNAi compared to the application of antisense oligonucleotides [109] . The RNAi approach can either be directed against the virus itself or against the virus's receptor, whose silencing will prevent virus entry into the cell.

The duration of gene silencing mediated by siRNAs is limited to a few days at most. Therefore, an alternative approach was developed to express self-complementary short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) intracellularly. These shRNAs are exported from the nucleus and processed into siRNAs, which can then be incorporated into RISC as described above. In addition, the shRNA strategy opens up the possibility of delivering expression cassettes into the target cells by viral vectors. The most commonly used vectors are based on retroviruses (including lentiviruses), adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) [110] .

Soon after its discovery, RNAi was considered a novel option to treat viral infections. Successful RNAi applications have been reported for most classes of medically relevant viruses including HIV-1, HBV, HCV, SARS-coronavirus, influenza virus und poliovirus [111, 112] . Some of these approaches have already reached the stage of clinical testing. While RNAi-mediated therapies against HIV-1 and HBV are based on shRNA expression systems [113] , the most advanced clinical phase II trial makes use of chemically synthesized siRNAs against RSV, which are administered by a nasal spray [114] .

Because of the highly efficient nature of RNAi, it comes as no surprise that RNAi has been evaluated as novel strategy to inhibit CVB3 [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] . All of the initial studies showed that only siRNAs against the coding region of the virus genome revealed significant antiviral activity, but not those against the untranslated regions. In order to investigate the mechanism of RNAi-mediated inhibition of CVB3 in more detail, siRNAs were intentionally designed to target either the viral plus strand or the minus strand or both [121] . This study provided clear evidence that silencing of the viral plus-strand is the key to inhibit CVB3, most likely because the minus-strand might be inaccessible to the silencing machinery.

A major problem for the long term inhibition of viruses is the emergence of escape mutants. This limitation, which is well known for conventional antiviral therapy with low-molecular weight drugs, is applicable to RNAi approaches as well. Virus escape as a consequence of the accumulation of point mutations in or close to the siRNA target site has been observed for various types of viruses, including poliovirus [122] and HIV [123, 124] . Three counter-strategies have been followed to counter the problem of viral escape: (1) targeting of conserved regions of the virus genome; (2) combination of efficient antiviral siRNAs; and (3) silencing of host factors that are essential for the viral life cycle.

Mutations in highly conserved regions of the virus genome are likely to cause a loss of virulence. Comparison of silencing by siRNAs against different genomic regions of CVB3 revealed that targeting of nonstructural protein coding regions is superior to selecting structural protein coding regions, since enzymes often lose activity when mutations occur [125] . Several groups have initially directed siRNA against the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the CVB3 genome, which harbors the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Interestingly, none of the tested siRNAs exerted significant antiviral activity [118, 119, 125, 126] . A possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that tight structures such as the IRES are detrimental to siRNA-mediated gene silencing [127] . Only after laborious screening for accessible sites for complementary oligonucleotides in the 5' UTR could siRNAs targeting the IRES be developed that were capable of inhibiting CVB3 [128] . The antiviral activity of the siRNA was improved further by its partial modification with locked nucleic acids (LNA), which have a high affinity towards complementary RNAs. Another highly conserved region of the CVB3 genome is the cis-acting replication element (CRE) located in the 2C protein coding region. An siRNA directed against this region conferred sustained protection against CVB3 and prevented the emergence of viable escape mutants [129] . Since the CRE sequence is identical in other enteroviruses such as echoviruses 6 and 7 and A-type as well as other B-type coxsackieviruses, the siRNA has a universal and persistent anti-enteroviral activity.

A widely employed strategy to minimize viral escape in conventional virus therapy is to combine various agents with antiviral activity. For HIV, this approach is known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) or combined anti-retroviral therapy. The adaptation of this idea to RNAi is the combination of two or more active siRNAs or shRNAs. Combination of two shRNA expression cassettes in one vector was found to maintain silencing activity against mutated target RNAs of CVB3 in a reporter system, since the second shRNA can compensate for the loss of silencing activity of the shRNA directed against the mutated target site [115] . A systematic investigation of viral escape in cell culture revealed that cocktails of three siRNAs targeting distinct sites of the virus genome could maintain therapeutic efficacy, while virus inhibition with dual-or single-molecule-based RNAi was abrogated by viral escape [125] .

In the long run, however, resistant mutants are likely to develop even against combinations of three or more site-specific siRNAs. Therefore, recently the idea was advanced to use a pool of siRNAs covering 3.5 kb of CVB3 genomic sequence [130] . The pool was generated by synthesizing a long double-stranded RNA covering the region encoding most of the non-structural proteins of CVB3, which was subsequently cleaved into siRNAs by recombinant Dicer. The pool was found to be significantly more effective than single-site siRNAs. Although this strategy can be expected to prevent viral escape, its therapeutic application is questionable since the antiviral agent consists of a heterogeneous mixture of hundreds of different siRNA molecules. It is currently unclear whether the pool of siRNAs will induce more severe off-target effects than single siRNAs, since it consists of numerous sequences, each of which can potentially regulate non-target RNAs.

The third strategy for sustained inhibition of viral spread is silencing of genes of the host cells that are required by the virus to enter cells and replicate (Figure 3 ). The advantage of this approach is that viruses have a limited capacity to adapt to host cell changes. CVB3 initially attaches to the decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which serves as a co-receptor, prior to the virus entering the host cells via CAR. Whereas CAR is essential for cardiac CVB3 infection [131] most or all CVB2, 4, 6 as well as some strains of CVB1, 3 and 5 do not bind DAF [132] . As expected, silencing of CAR was found to prevent infection of the treated cells by CVB3 [119, 133] . Whether CAR can be considered a therapeutic target is debatable, since an essential prerequisite for the medical application of this strategy would be that the factor is dispensable. CAR is located in the tight junctions of epithelial cells [132, 134] and its constitutive knockout was found to result in an embryonic lethal condition associated with cardiac defects [135] . In contrast, animals with a conditional knockout of CAR at a later time point of embryonic development (E11) survived to adulthood and did not have evident cardiac abnormalities [136] . Very detailed investigations of heart function, however, revealed a block of atrio-ventricular conduction developed in the absence of CAR in the adult mouse heart, which may lead to arrhythmia [137, 138] . This finding was confirmed more recently with conditional knockout mice that exhibited a complete atrio-ventricular block and various phenotypes in other organs as well [139] . It should, however, be noted that no direct conclusions can be drawn from knockout experiments for RNAi applications, since knock-out animals completely lack CAR while RNAi only results in a partial knockdown of target gene expression, possibly leaving enough to prevent these defects from occurring.

Since CAR might have essential cellular functions, other host factors should be considered as targets for inhibitors that block CVB3 indirectly. In a recent study, an RNAi screen covering the druggable genome was carried out to identify cellular factors required for CVB3 infection of human cells [140] . With this approach, a set of genes could be identified whose depletion inhibited infection. Further studies will now be necessary to evaluate whether any of these genes are suitable candidates for the development of inhibitors with antiviral activity.

Cellular delivery, potency and specificity of siRNAs can be improved by chemical modification of the double-stranded RNA [141] . In addition to LNA-modified siRNAs, which were mentioned above, siRNAs containing LNA, as well as unlocked nucleic acids (UNA), have been tested against CVB3 [142] . In this study, a design pattern could be elucidated in which the UNA monomers do not compromise the high antiviral siRNA activity. Further studies have shown that the introduction of UNAs into an siRNA minimizes off-target activity [143] , which constitutes one of the major challenges associated with the clinical use of RNAi. A second major hurdle for the application of RNAi is efficient cellular delivery of the siRNAs. Attachment of lipophilic molecules such as cholesterol or receptor ligands like folate have been shown to improve, in some cases cell-type specifically, cellular uptake of a given siRNA, even in the absence of delivery agents. A folate-linked bacterial phage packaging RNA was used as a vehicle to deliver double-stranded RNA into HeLa cells, a folate receptor positive cancer cell line widely used as an in vitro model for CVB3 infection [144] . As a further development of this strategy, an artificial micro RNA (amiRNA) targeting the 3' untranslated region of the CVB3 genome instead of standard siRNAs was used as the silencing mediator [145] . The amiRNA was designed to contain mismatches to the central region of the target site and was shown to tolerate mutations, thus having the potential to suppress viral escape mutants.

A major challenge in the development of new therapeutic strategies is the translation of knowledge gained with cell culture experiments to the in vivo situation. An siRNA targeting the 2A protease encoding genomic region was found to lead to significant reduction of viral tissue titers, attenuate tissue damage, and prolong survival in highly susceptible type I interferon receptor-knockout mice [116] . As outlined above, prolonged silencing can be achieved by continuous intracellular generation of shRNAs from expression cassettes. As a proof-of-principle for this approach, plasmid-derived shRNAs were used to inhibit CVB3 in Balb/c mice [126] . Two of the tested shRNAs exerted strong antiviral effects accompanied by attenuated pancreatic tissue damage. For both of the aforementioned studies, however, the siRNAs and shRNA expression plasmids, respectively, were applied by hydrodynamic transfection. This method involves high pressure injection of the nucleic acid into the tail vein, which does not lend itself to a therapeutic setting for humans. It was therefore necessary to develop alternative application routes for efficient RNAi-mediated inhibition of CVB3. Since delivery of chemically synthesized siRNAs across the endothelial barrier to cardiomyocytes is inefficient, even in the presence of transfection agents, transfer of shRNA expression cassettes by viral vectors appears to be the method of choice.

Kim et al. used a lentiviral vector to deliver the expression cassette for the above mentioned shRNA against the highly conserved CRE region [146] . Mice were injected intraperitoneally with the lentiviral vector and were subsequently challenged with CVB3. Treated animals had significant reductions in viral titers, viral myocarditis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and, most importantly, the survival rate was improved from 20% to 50% at day ten after infection. Since retroviral vectors bear the risk of insertional mutagenesis and adenoviral vectors induce a strong immune response, vectors based on adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are considered promising vehicles for gene transfer. While the wild type virus is single-stranded, the more recently used viral vectors contain a self-complementary double stranded genome, which ensures rapid onset and a high level expression of the transgene [147] . Furthermore, tissue tropism of the viral vector can be directed by the use of pseudotyped AAV vectors, which consist of a genome based on the standard serotype 2 and capsid proteins from a different serotype. We could show that delivery of the shRNA double expression cassette by a pseudotyped, self-complementary AAV vector into primary rat cardiomyocytes inhibited CVB3 replication by about 3 orders of magnitude. Moreover, in mice with CVB3 myocarditis, the RNAi treatment significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction [120] .

Taken together, the in vitro studies demonstrate that RNAi is an efficient approach to inhibit CVB3 and subsequent in vivo studies confirmed viral vectors to be suitable vehicles for the delivery of shRNA expression cassettes to the heart. The technology thus has the potential to develop into a therapeutic option to treat humans with virus-induced myocarditis [148] .

A prerequisite of successful virus uptake is the specific binding of the virus to a cellular receptor. Soluble receptors analogues (SRA) bind to the virus before the virus interacts with their cellular receptors, thus preventing binding of the virus and subsequent uptake into the target cells. SRA can be found as naturally occurring cellular proteins generated by alternative splicing of the cellular receptor transcripts or are artificially designed as recombinant proteins by genetic engineering [149, 150] . Many SRA lack the transmembrane domain. This domain is necessary for anchoring the natural receptor protein in the cell membrane and its absence enables SRA to pass through the cell membrane and accumulate in the extracellular space. In general, SRA that exclusively consist of virus binding sites are sufficient to neutralize the target virus. Their efficiency, however, is sometimes too poor to allow their use in therapeutic treatments [151, 152] . Genetic engineering can increase SRA efficiency. The most common modification represents the fusion of the virus binding domain with the carboxy-terminus of the human IgG1 Fc region, resulting in generation of a dimeric antibody-like molecule [153] . Important effects result from this modification. The antibody Fc-region promotes the solubilization of the SRA, the half-life of the fusion protein increases up to 100-fold in vivo [154] and recognition of the IgG-Fc domain by Fc receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages enables clearing of the virus shortly after the virus is bound to the soluble receptor peptide by phagocytic cells [155] . Moreover, large amounts of soluble IgG-Fc can easily be purified using a protein A-coupled sepharose [150] . In this context it was shown that CVB3 neutralization was 125-fold more efficient with soluble DAF-IgG Fc fusion proteins (sDAF-Fc) than with the monomeric sDAF homologue comprising only of the cellular DAF ectodomain [156] . Alternatively the virus binding domain of a virus receptor can be fused to the C-terminal part of the C4b binding protein (C4bp) α chain leading to production of a disulfide-linked homo-octamer soluble protein with a spider-like structure [151] . Christiansen et al. reported that a fusion protein encompassing the CD46 ectodomain linked to C-terminal part of the C4bp α chain (sCD46-C4bpα) was able to bind to the measles virus hemagglutinin protein expressed on murine cells with a higher avidity than soluble monomeric CD46 (sCD46). Moreover, sCD46-C4bpα, but not the sCD46, fully protected CD46 transgenic mice against a lethal intracranial measles virus challenge [151] .

Competitive inhibition, as well as steric problems during the entry or uncoating steps, seem to be the main mechanisms responsible for blocking of viruses by SRA [157] . Another significant blocking mechanism was elucidated for SRA targeting viruses of the picornavirus family. In analogy to the physiological mechanism occurring during natural virus binding to cell receptor, it has been shown that the exposure of coxsackieviruses to virus specific SRA can induce the formation of altered (A)-particles [156, 158] (Figure 4) . A-particles have low buoyant density and lack the viral VP4 and the RNA-genome. These particles have lost their capacity to infect cells and their formation is an irreversible process [132, 157] .

The protective effect of SRA has been described for several viruses including HIV [159] , adenovirus [160] , measles virus [152] and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) [161] . Its effectiveness was also demonstrated for several members of the picornoviridae including entererovirus 71 [162] , rhinovirus [157] , and polioviruses [163] . To test their potential for inhibition of coxsackievirus myocarditis, SRA of CAR (sCAR-Fc) and DAF (sDAF-Fc) were developed and analyzed in different CVB3 myocarditis models [150, 154, 160, 164] . Yanagawa et al. injected recombinant sDAF-Fc in mice 3 days before, concurrent with or 3 days after CVB3 infection. Histological examination demonstrated a significant reduction in lesion area, cell necrosis, calcification, and inflammation in hearts of animals treated before and concurrent with CVB3 but not in the post-infection group. However, all groups had a similar reduction of infectious CVB3 in the heart [150] . Very similar results were subsequently obtained with sCAR-Fc. The therapeutic effect induced by sCAR-Fc, however, seemed to be stronger than that observed for sDAF-Fc, especially in the pre-and concomitant treated groups [154] . Moreover, sCAR-Fc inhibited CVB3 induced pancreatitis in vivo, which was not found for sDAF-Fc [150, 154] . Differences in efficiency can be explained by the fact that sCAR-Fc bind to CVB3 with 5,000-to 10,000-higher affinities than the equivalent form of DAF [156] but also the fact that sCAR-Fc induces A-particles, whereas sDAF-Fc forms reversible complexes with CVB3 [158] , may contribute to this observation ( Figure 4) . Although these results convincingly demonstrate that sDAF-Fc and sCAR-Fc can efficiently inhibit CVB3-induced myocarditis, a comprehensive assessment regarding the impact on contractile heart parameters, the most important parameters from the clinical perspective, was not carried out in these studies. We therefore aimed at characterizing the protective effect of sCAR-Fc treatment in more detail. To this end, we cloned sCAR-Fc and inserted it into an adenoviral vector under control of a doxycycline (Dox) inducible promoter. Following systemic application, sCAR-Fc expression was induced by addition of Dox 2 days before, concomitant and 1 day after CVB3 infection. Induction of sCAR-Fc prior to infection completely blocked the virus and even concomitant and post-infection induction strongly reduced cardiac CVB3 infection, myocardial injury, and inflammation. Moreover, a significant improvement of systolic and diastolic cardiac parameters was detected in animals in which sCAR-Fc expression was induced prior to or concomitant with the CVB3 infection [164] . As Dox induction results in therapeutic serum levels of sCAR-Fc (ranging between 20-100 ng/mL [160] ) 16 to 24 hours after induction at the earliest, the improvement in hemodynamic parameters in the concomitant group revealed that sCAR-Fc had a distinct therapeutic effect on heart function.

In a further approach aimed at generating sCAR-Fc/sDAF-Fc variants with increased efficiency, Lim et al. constructed sCAR-sDAF receptor chimeras containing the virus binding sites from hCAR and hDAF fused to the human IgG1 Fc region. One of this fusion proteins, hCAR:hDAF-Fc, showed stronger CVB3 neutralizing activity than sCAR-Fc in vitro and its employment in vivo resulted in significantly higher survival rates of CVB3 infected mice than observed for sCAR-Fc [160] . Finally, one study analyzed the potential of the naturally occurring sCAR variant CAR4/7, originally detected as a CAR splice variant in HeLa cells [149] , for inhibition of CVB3 myocarditis. Although the viral load in hearts of CVB3 infected animals treated with CAR4/7 was significantly reduced, surprisingly the animals developed signs of autoimmune myocarditis characterized by aggravated myocardial inflammation, tissue damage and presence of CAR-specific antibodies which were autoreactive against myocardial tissues [165] . The mechanisms leading to these auto-immunologic side effects induced by CAR4/7 are not yet understood. There may be specific immunological reactions related to the specific sequence of CAR4/7, or perhaps it relates to the fact that recombinant CAR4/7 was produced in bacteria, which altered its glycosylation pattern and increased the risk of co-purifying pro-inflammatory substances. In this regard it should be noted that the other approaches employing sCAR or sDAF variants in CVB3 infected mice in vivo did not lead to these side effects, as mentioned above, demonstrating that it is not a general feature of sCAR, sDAF.

The therapeutic potential of the combination of sCAR-Fc or sDAF-Fc with other therapeutical approaches (pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances, RNAi, immunomodulators) in CVB3 myocarditis remains to be uncovered. As one initial example, we have recently demonstrated that the simultaneous application of sCAR-Fc and siRNAs against CVB3 exerts synergistic antiviral activity in the treatment of a persistently infected cardiac cell line in vitro [166] . Further studies are currently underway to verify these results in CVB3 myocarditis models in vivo.

Summarizing these data, it can be concluded that sCAR-Fc and sDAF-Fc represent novel promising biologics that may potentially be used for treatment of coxsackievirus infections in humans. However, several questions are still unanswered and must be addressed in further research. Can coxsackieviruses develop resistance against sCAR and sDAF? What is the safety profile after long term application? Can sCAR or sDAF inhibit the development of chronic forms of CVB3 myocarditis?

Due to the great progress made in the understanding of stem cell therapy in recent years, application of stem cells is considered as one of the most promising strategies for therapeutic interventions in the future. Regenerative approaches aim at the restoration of the physiological cellular composition of diseased organs. Recent research indicates that the mammalian heart can be repopulated by cells from extra-cardiac sources. Transplantation of exogenous cells is therefore considered to be the likely next generation of cardiac cell therapies [167] .

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the particular advantage of being non-immunogenic and thus allow the use of allogenic MSCs for clinical applications. In a recent preclinical study, the potential of MSCs to improve myocarditis induced by CVB3 was demonstrated for the first time [168] . As a prerequisite for the clinical application of this strategy, MSCs were shown not to be infected by CVB3, most likely due to a low expression level of CAR. In co-culture experiments with the cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1, MSCs reduced CVB3-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, MSC diminished viral progeny release by approximately 5-fold. Importantly, intravenous injection of MSCs decreased cardiac apoptosis and improved left ventricular function in an experimental model of murine acute CVB3-induced myocarditis. A detailed mechanistic analysis revealed that the protective effect of the MSCs is mediated in an NO-dependent manner and requires priming via IFN-γ. Further research, however, will be required to investigate possible side effects and the potential of MSC transplantation for the treatment of CVB3 induced myocarditis.

Coxsackieviruses are one of the most important infectious agents associated with acute and chronic myocarditis in humans. Based on the elucidation of the coxsackieviral replication cycle a wide panel of pharmacologically active low molecular weight substances with strong antiviral activity have been developed but to date none are in routine clinical use. More recently biologics such as SRA, siRNAs or MSC have been found to be suitable to inhibit viral replication and inhibit coxsackievirus myocarditis ( Table 1) , but further investigation is necessary to elucidate their full therapeutic potentials and safety profiles. Based on our understanding of the pathogenesis of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis, considering that both viral and immune and autoimmune mechanisms are involved in progression of the disease, antiviral therapy and its combination with immunomodulatory therapies may hold the greatest potential for improving the therapeutic outcome of coxsackievirus infection.

New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets,"Background: The urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype H1N1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir, the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses, and indeed the evolving swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic. A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class.","A novel class of human monoclonal antibodies against influenza has been recently discovered [1] . These antibodies bind to the membrane-proximal stem of haemagglutinin, the major viral surface protein, and neutralize the influenza virus by blocking its fusion with the host cell [2] . A panel of antibodies with a similar mode of action was reported subsequently by Sui et al. [3] . Due to the high conservation of their recognition site, this class of antibodies has shown the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza subtypes, including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 [1] , and can be expected to also neutralize viruses from subtypes H4, H8, H11-H14 and H16, as well as their future antigenic drift variants [2] . One of these antibodies, CR6261, was investigated in mice and shown to be protective when given before and after lethal challenges with H1N1 and H5N1 virus, suggesting that it has potential as the first-ever broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections [1] .

According to the World Health Organization, seasonal influenza causes up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year [4] . Immunologically naïve infants, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly are particularly susceptible to illness caused by seasonal influenza viruses, with 90% of deaths occurring in the latter group [4, 5] . In addition, subtypes of influenza A viruses that have not previously circulated among humans occasionally cross from animal reservoirs, raising the spectre of a pandemic.

Over the past decade, the most prominent pandemic threat appeared to be posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1. However, it was a new strain of human H1N1 that emerged in Mexico and the United States in March and April 2009 and rapidly spread across the globe that caused the WHO to declare a pandemic on June 11th [6, 7] . Although the virulence of this virus is currently moderate, particularly compared to the case fatality rate of over 60% of human H5N1 infections, this may change over time. Meanwhile, the threat from highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses persists as they continue to circulate and evolve in bird populations.

Preventive vaccination has historically been the primary means of influenza control, but this approach has important limitations. Vaccines typically elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response only to the specific viral strains they contain, and closely related viruses [8, 9] . Furthermore, influenza vaccines have suboptimal immunogenicity and efficacy in the groups at highest risk of severe disease: the very young, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [10] .

The current therapeutic regimen for influenza A is limited to two classes of drugs: the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Adamantanes rapidly elicit viral resistance, and resistance rates are high among H3N2 viruses and certain clades of H5N1 viruses [11] [12] [13] [14] . The use of oseltamivir, the leading antiviral influenza drug, has been limited by the sudden and widespread emergence of resistance among circulating H1N1 influenza strains [15, 16] . Oseltamivir resistance has also been observed during treatment of H5N1 infection [17, 18] . Zanamivir is still effective against H1N1 viruses and resistance to this drug is less likely to arise [19] . However, its use is limited to patients who can actively use an inhaled drug, which excludes young children, impaired older adults, or patients with underlying airway disease [16] -once again, the group of patients most vulnerable to serious complications from influenza infection.

In the absence of reliable antiviral drugs and vaccines, development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is urgently required. In order to assess whether CR6261 may be a viable option for human treatment, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this human monoclonal antibody in a highly stringent lethal H5N1 influenza ferret model. The ferret is the most suitable disease model for human influenza infection as it displays very human-like disease [20] [21] [22] .

Four groups of 6 ferrets each received 30, 10, 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 via an intravenous injection and were challenged the next day with the highly pathogenic avian A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus. A control group of 6 ferrets received 30 mg/kg of the irrelevant isotype-matched antibody CR3014.

All ferrets that received 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 survived, compared to only 33.3% of the control animals ( Figure 1A) . A further reduction of the dose to 3 mg/kg was clearly correlated with a lower survival rate of 66.7%. Though not statistically significant different from survival observed in control animals, there is a 50% mortality reduction. The lowest dose of 1 mg/kg CR6261 was not associated with survival benefit compared to control animals. Survival times differed significantly between groups receiving 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 and the control group (p = 0.020).

Moribund animals showed general depression, anorexia and lethargy, and exhibited clinical signs of respiratory disease, including dyspnoea. Animals treated at efficacious dose levels (30 and 10 mg/kg) did not loose body weight, whereas the mean weight loss in the control group was 10.5% by the time the ferrets died or were euthanized ( Figure 1B ). An exception was one control ferret that succumbed to infection within 48 hours after challenge and lost hardly any weight before. Ferrets that received 3 or 1 mg/ kg CR6261 showed similar declines in body weight as the control animals.

One day after challenge the maximum body temperature was observed; for each ferret the maximum body temperature is depicted in figure 1C . The groups treated with 30 or 10 mg/kg had mean temperatures of 39.4uC and 40.7uC, respectively, which were significantly lower than the mean of 41.7uC observed in the control group (p,0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). The mean temperature observed in animals treated with the lower doses of CR6261 (41.3uC and 41.5uC for 3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) did not differ significantly from the control group.

The mean temperature in animals observed 3 days before challenge was similar across the 5 groups, ranging from 37.6uC to 38.4uC. Individual body temperature varied considerably within one healthy ferret over 24 hours (standard deviation 0.7uC).

Ferrets treated with 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract at any time, whereas animals in the control group did ( Figure 1D ). Treatment with 3 and 1 mg/kg did not prevent shedding, but reduced the proportion of ferrets with infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs.

After necropsy, all ferrets were assessed for viral load in the lungs (figure 1E), and the animals that received 30 mg/kg CR6261 or control antibody were also assessed for viral load in the brain, liver, spleen, blood and kidney. The levels of virus replication in the lungs of ferrets treated with 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 were 3.9 and 2.9 log 10 TCID 50 /g lower than that in the control group (both p,0.001). No infectious virus was detected in any of the other organs of the ferrets that received 30 mg/kg CR6261, whereas infectious virus was found in the brain of 2, the liver of 3, and the spleen of 5 of the 6 control animals (data not shown). There was no significant difference in lung viral load in the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 compared to the control group (p = 0.74 and p = 0.91, respectively).

Histopathological results were in accordance with the findings described above; animals that received 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed much less pulmonary lesions such as primary atypical pneumonia, subacute bronch(iol)itis, emphysema and congestion, or showed such lesions at a lower grade of severity, compared to animals from the other groups. Bronchiolitis obliterans was not observed in any animal that received 30 mg/kg CR6261. Compared to this higher-dose group, animals that received 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed more regenerative response (diffuse grey/red area and bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) in the lungs, and more inflammatory changes in the trachea. Pulmonary oedema was not observed in animals that received 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261, but was observed frequently in all other groups. These findings were in agreement with mean lung weights, which were lowest in the animals treated with 30 or 10 mg/ kg CR6261 (6.3 g and 7.6 g, respectively) and significantly lower in this group than in control animals (15.0 g; both comparisons p,0.001). No significant difference in lung weight was found between the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 (14.1 g and 15.4 g, respectively) and the control group (15.0 g).

These findings show that, in a dose dependent way, prophylactically administered CR6261 confers protection against lethal H5N1 challenge, prevents morbidity and viral dissemination and reduces pulmonary pathology.

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of the monoclonal antibody CR6261, two groups of 10 ferrets were challenged as above and given 30 mg/kg of CR6261 either 4 or 24 hours later. A comparator group of 10 ferrets received 30 mg/kg of the control antibody 4 hours after challenge.

Survival rates in the groups receiving CR6261 at 4 and 24 hours after challenge were 100%, whereas only 20% of the animals in the control group survived (p,0.001) (Figure 2A ). Mean decline in body weight at the end of the experiment was 6.2% in the group of ferrets that received CR6261 4 hours after challenge ( Figure 2B) , which was significantly less (p = 0.025) than the 10.1% observed in control animals. Animals treated 24 hours post challenge showed a mean body weight loss of 8.4%, which was not significantly different from the control animals (p = 0.427). The group of ferrets treated with CR6261 4 hours post challenge had a mean maximum temperature of 40.0uC, compared to 41.8uC in the control group (p,0.001). In line with the rapid rise in temperature after challenge observed in the prophylaxis experiment ferrets treated with CR6261 24 hours after challenge showed a mean maximal temperature of 41.5uC before CR6261 was administered (p = 0.15 versus 41.8uC of the control group, figure 2C ).

Ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract throughout the study ( figure 2D ). In the group treated with CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge, one ferret had a low concentration of infectious virus (2.8 log 10 TCID 50 ) in the throat on day one, but no virus was detected on subsequent days. In contrast, all animals in the control group shed virus during one or more days. Accordingly, the mean viral loads in the lungs of ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 and 24 hours post challenge were considerably lower than that in the control group (differences were 3.9 and 4.5 log 10 TCID 50 /g, respectively, both comparisons p,0.001; Figure 2E ).

The lungs of animals that received CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge showed less pulmonary lesions (alveolar oedema, bronchiolitis obliterans, congestion, emphysema, bronchioloalveo- lar hyperplasia and primary atypical pneumonia), or showed such lesions at a lower grade of severity, compared to the lungs of animals from the other two groups. Animals of the control group were most affected by primary atypical pneumonia. These findings were in accordance with the observation that the mean lung weights of ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge were lower compared to the control group (5.7 g versus 14.9 g, p,0.001; Figure 2F ). Animals that received CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge showed most regenerative response (bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) in the lungs, suggesting damage to the lung parenchyma with subsequent regenerative response. The mean lung weight in this group was significantly higher than that of the group receiving CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge (8.4 g versus 5.7 g), but lower than that of the control group (p,0.001).

From the study outset, one animal had been added to each of the two treatment groups to be sacrificed for gross-pathology and histology on lungs as soon as 50% of the control animals died. The purpose was to test for possible bias due to differences in the timing of death. Infectious virus titres in the lungs of the treated ferrets sacrificed at day 3 were identical to those in treated animals sacrificed at the end of the study (open circles in figure 2E) . Similarly, there were no differences in lung weight and pathology between animals sacrificed at day 3 or after day 5 ( figure 2F ). This indicates that the results were not biased by differences in the timing of euthanasia or spontaneous death.

CR6261 represents a new class of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibits immediate and potent efficacy for the prevention or treatment of influenza in a clinically relevant model for severe disease. The results presented here also confirm previously reported data demonstrating the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of CR6261 in mice challenged with H5N1 influenza viruses. Together with the H1N1 challenged mice data published earlier [1] these findings indicate that CR6261 is effective across a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, including seasonal and potentially pandemic strains.

Passive immunotherapy would be particularly beneficial for the groups at highest risk of severe disease due to seasonal influenzathe elderly and immuno-compromised-but may also be indispensable for the general public in the event of a pandemic disease outbreak caused by high-risk pandemic candidates such as H2, H5, H6 and H9.

Monoclonal antibodies against influenza viruses have been studied for decades, but their potential-and thus development-as 'passive' immunotherapy for influenza has been inhibited by the lack of monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. This lack is due to the tolerance of influenza virus for genetic changes in the most immunogenic regions on its surface. The recent discovery of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal influenza antibodies [1] and the demonstrated efficacy of a representative of this novel class of antibodies against lethal viral challenge in a clinically relevant model, as presented in this paper, create an opportunity for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections, regardless of the causal strain. The possibility of a potent and broadly neutralizing agent that would equip clinicians and public health workers to deal effectively with the influenza viruses of the future represents a paradigm shift in the approach to influenza control.

Influenza illness observed in the ferrets infected with H5N1 virus in this study closely resembles influenza in humans with H5N1 infection, who present with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia [23] . Besides respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are often present. In severe cases, the pneumonia rapidly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. High viral loads, extrapulmonary virus dissemination and hypercytokinaemia are associated with fatal outcome (reviewed in [24] [25] [26] ). Autopsies of patients who succumbed to influenza A (H5N1) virus infection have shown diffuse alveolar damage, patchy interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis with squamous metaplasia and pulmonary congestion with various degrees of haemorrhage [27] [28] [29] . The clinical signs observed in the control animals of this ferret study correspond to the most severe influenza pathology in humans [23] . The efficacy of CR6261 in preventing these clinical signs in the prophylactic and therapeutic ferret model presented here, together with the efficacy shown in mice after lethal challenges with different viruses, strongly indicate that CR6261 can be expected to be efficacious against disease caused by the other, less virulent viruses it neutralized in vitro [1] .

In a meta-analysis of experimental influenza infection of placebo-treated and untreated healthy volunteers, Carrat et al. [30] studied 1280 participants who were challenged with either influenza type H1N1, H3N2 or B. Interestingly, viral shedding was highly correlated with the presence of clinical symptoms such as fever, runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, cough and shortness of breath. The authors concluded from their meta-analysis that subjects with symptomatic illness shed virus in amounts 100 to 1000 fold higher than subjects who were not ill. The fact that CR6261 after intravenous administration instantaneously reduces viral shedding indicates that in man CR6261 might reduce clinical symptoms in subjects infected with influenza virus. In addition, studies in guinea pigs showed that a reduction in nasal wash titers correlate with a decreased efficiency of viral transmission by aerosol [31] . The ability of CR6261 to abolish shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions strongly suggests that antibodies like CR6261 might prevent or reduce virus spreading at the onset of an epidemic influenza outbreak in nursing homes or in case of a pandemic.

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus, as this provides a stringent disease model for severe influenza. However, the potential use of this antibody is not limited to viruses of this subtype or to other avian strains that may pose a pandemic threat. CR6261 has been shown to recognize H1 viruses that have emerged over a time span of 90 years from the H1N1 virus which caused the 1918 'Spanish flu' pandemic to the latest Brisbane viruses. Since the epitope is conserved CR6261 is predicted to bind to future antigenic drift variants. This means that CR6261 could be used to protect against all H1 influenza viruses, including the ones resistant to oseltamivir. Use of CR6261 in combination with effective medication against H3, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir, would effectively protect against all seasonal influenza viruses, without a need for prior knowledge of the virus subtype or strain.

In the present study ferrets were challenged with an inoculum which is probably much higher compared to the viral exposure in naturally infection in humans. The rapid deterioration in ferrets with death occurring within 3 days underpins this hypothesis since humans exposed to H5N1 develop the first symptoms 2-4 days after the last exposure and even periods of up to 8 days have been reported [25] . The clinical signs in this model are quite extreme, but important for establishing the efficacy of the antibody as proof of concept. The data of these two experiments demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant ferret model of human influenza.

The human monoclonal antibody CR6261 was isolated from the IgM+, CD27+ B cell repertoire of a healthy individual who was recently vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine, using phage display selection on recombinant H5 haemagglutinin [1] . CR3014, an isotype-matched antibody with the ability to neutralize SARS corona virus-which has similar tissue/organ tropism as that of H5 viruses-was used as a control antibody [32] . Both antibodies were produced on PER.C6H cells.

The study was performed with outbred ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, female, age approximately 8 months, Schimmel Farms, Uddel, the Netherlands). Ferrets were screened for the presence of serum antibodies against Aleutian Disease virus, circulating seasonal influenza virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) and the challenge virus (H5N1, A/Indonesia/5/2005), and only seronegative animals were used in the study. The animals were housed in study groups of 6 (prophylactic experiment) or 10 (therapeutic experiment).

Antibodies were administered by intravenous injection in the jugular vein. Viral challenge was performed intratracheally with 10 5 TCID 50 A/Indonesia/05/2005 in 3 mL of PBS [33] . Clinical observations were performed twice a day on days of intervention and once daily on other days. In the prophylactic experiment, animals were weighed 2 weeks before viral challenge (day 214), immediately prior to antibody administration (day 21), and after challenge (days 2, 4, and 5 or on the day of premature death). In the therapeutic experiment, animals were weighed on day 214 and day 22, immediately prior to challenge and antibody administration, and on days 2, 4 and the last study day. Body temperature was recorded every 15 minutes throughout both experiments using a device (DST micro-T, Star-Oddi, Reykjavik, Iceland) implanted in the peritoneal cavity 14 days before challenge.

The animal experiments were carried out in the central animal facilities of the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI, Bilthoven) under conditions that meet the Dutch legal requirements for animal experimentation and are in accordance with the 'Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals', the recommendations of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (US National Institutes of Health), and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAA-LAC) standards.

Viral titrations were performed as described elsewhere [34] . Briefly, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were collected from all animals at day 21, day 2, day 4, and day 5. Individual swabs were homogenized and resuspended in 3 ml medium and stored at 280uC until analysis. Viral titres were determined by virus titration on Madine Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract was analysed by calculating the proportion of ferrets with detectable levels of infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs relative to the number of living ferrets.

After necropsy, the cranioventral, craniodorsal, caudoventral and caudodorsal sections of the right lung were collected from each animal, weighed, homogenized and resuspended in 3 ml medium, and stored at 280uC until analysis. Viral titres were determined after thawing of the tissue sections followed by homogenization and resuspension by virus titration on MDCK cells. In addition, viral titres in tissues of brain, spleen, liver, kidney, and plasma from animals that received either 30 mg/kg of CR6261 or CR3014 one day prior to challenge were determined using the same method.

A complete macroscopic post-mortem examination was performed on all animals. This included examination of the external surfaces and all orifices; the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities with their associated organs and tissues; and the neck with its associated organs and tissues. Lungs were weighed and all lung lobes were inspected and lesions described. The left lung (including trachea) was collected during autopsy, inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin for fixation/histology and microscopic examination. Paraffin embedded tissue sections (left cranial lobe, left caudal lobe, right cranial-, middle-and caudal lobes and accessory lobe) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and assessed by light microscopy for aspects like congestion, emphysema, presence of foreign body, haemorrhagy, bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia and inflammation, and oedema.

Prior to blood sampling, the taking of nose and throat swabs and euthanasia, the ferrets were anaesthetised with ketamin (25 mg/ kg; i.m.). For implantation of temperature sensors, antibody administration and viral challenge, the animals were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamin (12.5 mg/kg; i.m.) and domitor (7.5 mg/ kg; i.m.), followed by antisedan (0.5 mg/kg; i.m.).

Survival times after viral challenge were analysed using the logrank test and survival proportions using the Fisher's exact test. Body weight expressed as percentage change from baseline was calculated at the end of the study period (or earlier in the event of earlier death). Maximum body temperatures were observed during day one and these values were subsequently used for calculating the mean maximum body temperature for each group. Variables were analysed in an one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc testing to compare to the control group using Dunnett's adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Lung weight and lung viral titres were compared across arms using ANOVA, with day of necropsy entered as a covariate. Differences between treatment groups were estimated using marginal means, with Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc. USA). Statistical significance level was set at a = 0.05.

Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis,‡,"www.sciencetranslationalmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/9/375/eaah3438/DC1 Fig. S1 . RANKL and OPG expression in CHIKV-infected joints. 

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes severe acute and chronic polyarthritis. CHIKV was first isolated in Tanzania in 1947 (1), but the virus has emerged rapidly over the last decade, causing outbreaks in the islands of the Indian Ocean, in Southern Europe, and in Southeast Asia (2) . In 2013, CHIKV spread to the Western Hemisphere and, by the end of 2015, had infected more than 1.8 million people in North America, Central America, and South America. The acute symptoms of CHIKV infection include fever and rash, which typically resolve within a few days, and joint and muscle pain (3) . CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the synovium to cause inflammatory arthritis (4) , which is characterized by articular swelling and prolonged morning stiffness (3) . CHIKV-induced arthritis in humans can persist, with as many as 60% of individuals progressing to chronic disease that lasts from months to years (3, (5) (6) (7) . Epidemiological projections suggest that there are currently about 400,000 individuals in the Western Hemisphere with chronic CHIKV arthritis (8) .

Chronic CHIKV arthritis clinically is similar to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (3, (9) (10) (11) , an autoimmune disease characterized by symmetrical joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. Treatment with newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been effective in preventing the bone erosions and deformities seen in patients with untreated RA. Whether chronic CHIKV arthritis causes erosive disease remains controversial, although there are reports of bone erosions in patients infected with CHIKV (9) . Effective treatment of RA relies on early diagnosis, because erosions can occur within months of onset of the disease (12) . Because CHIKV and RA exhibit significant clinical overlap, there is potential for confusing the diagnoses and inadvertently treating CHIKV arthritis with DMARD therapy (3) .

(TNF-α) and anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor]. Other biological DMARDs block T cell costimulation (CTLA4-Ig) or deplete B cells (anti-CD20). Among the newest drugs used to treat RA is tofacitinib, an oral DMARD that inhibits JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling and broadly blunts cytokine responses (13, 14) . However, many DMARDs, by virtue of their immunosuppressive properties, may predispose to serious microbial infections. Thus, there is a need to determine whether DMARDs are effective, benign, or deleterious in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis. The current standard of care for CHIKV arthritis is treatment with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (15) , although these often do not ameliorate symptoms (3). One trial compared chloroquine (a DMARD) to meloxicam (an NSAID) and found no difference in efficacy (15) , although a placebo group was not included in the trial design. Another open-label study examined a combination of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis and found that some patients partially responded to therapy, although ~50% of patients did not achieve significant improvement in disease score (16) .

Subcutaneous inoculation of young wild-type (WT) immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with pathogenic strains of CHIKV results in acute foot swelling, myositis, and arthritis (4, 17) . In this model, swelling resolves within the first 2 weeks of infection (17, 18) , although mild chronic disease can be observed histologically for weeks to months (4) . This finding contrasts with the disease in humans, which are natural hosts and frequently have a protracted clinical disease course. Human patients with CHIKV arthritis have increased numbers of circulating, activated cytolytic CD8 + T cells, as do patients with untreated RA (3).

Gene expression signatures observed in mouse models of CHIKV arthritis and RA suggested overlapping contributions of T cell-associated pathways in these diseases (19) . Mice lacking or depleted of CD4 + Tcells have reduced foot swelling and arthritis during acute CHIKV infection, suggesting that CD4 + T cells contribute to the pathology of arthritis (20) . Inflammatory monocytes also are thought to play an initiating role in CHIKV arthritis in mice, because inhibiting production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) with bindarit (21) improved the disease. Finally, treatment of mice with anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1 day before infection prevents arthritis (22) (23) (24) , but whether therapy after infection is effective has not been studied. Moreover, no previous study has tested the efficacy of clinically available DMARDs against CHIKV arthritis in mice.

Here, we examined the efficacy of several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved RA therapies in a mouse model of CHIKV infection. We identified two DMARDs (CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib) with efficacy during acute CHIKV arthritis. In particular, CTLA4-Ig, when paired with the neutralizing anti-CHIKV human mAb 4N12, was highly effective at reducing joint inflammation, periarticular swelling, migration of inflammatory leukocytes, and infection even when administered several days after virus inoculation. Thus, combination of anti-inflammatory and antibody-based antiviral therapy may serve as a model for treating humans with arthritis caused by CHIKV or other related viruses.

On the basis of previous data showing that immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to CHIKV arthritis in mice (20) and our study showing that CHIKV arthritis clinically can mimic seronegative RA (3), we hypothesized that some of the existing FDAapproved therapies for RA might ameliorate acute CHIKV arthritis. To test this idea, we performed a multiarm prospective study (Fig. 1A ) by inoculating 224 4-week-old WT mice subcutaneously in the left rear foot with 10 3 focus-forming units (FFU) of a pathogenic clinical isolate of CHIKV (La Reunion, 2006) . Mice were divided into groups of 28 animals that received one of the following treatments beginning on day 3 after infection: methylprednisolone, naproxen, methotrexate, etanercept (soluble human TNF-α receptor), CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), oral gavage vehicle control, or tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor). All of the biological agents that we used have been shown previously to have activity in mice (13, 25, 26) . We chose day 3 after infection to initiate treatment, because this represents the time point of the first peak of clinically apparent foot swelling in the WTC57BL/6 mouse model of CHIKV infection (Fig. 1B) . Animals were followed for clinical joint swelling in the ipsilateral foot and viral yield at different times after infection and treatment.

Treatment with CTLA4-Ig or tofacitinib at day 3 ameliorated foot swelling on day 7 after infection at the point of peak clinical disease [ Fig. 1 , C to F; 9.0 mm 2 (injection control) versus 7.8 mm 2 (CTLA4-Ig), P < 0.005 and 9.3 mm 2 (oral control) versus 8.5 mm 2 (tofacitinib), P < 0.005]. Other treatments had no significant effect at the dose tested in our experiments. To assess the systemic and local impact on viral burden of DMARD treatment, we evaluated CHIKV RNA levels on day 7 in serum and joint tissues. Remarkably, none of the therapies affected viral RNA levels in the right ankle or left ankle at day 7 or day 28 after infection compared to controls (Fig. 1 , G to J; P > 0.1). Thus, CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib ameliorate joint and periarticular inflammation in mice during the acute phase without substantively altering the viral burden in inflamed tissues. The beneficial effect of CTLA4-Ig, which blocks T cell activation (25) , is consistent with data suggesting that CD4 + T cells contribute to immunopathology associated with CHIKV arthritis (20) .

We next tested whether combination immunomodulatory and antiviral therapy might have greater beneficial effects. Potently neutralizing human anti-CHIKV mAbs previously were shown to protect against CHIKV-induced lethality in immunocompromised Ifnar1 −/− mice, even when administered at late time points after infection (27) . We administered either a single 600-μg dose of a control immunoglobulin G (IgG), 300 μg of CTLA4-Ig, 300 μg of anti-CHIKV mAb (4N12, a neutralizing anti-CHIKV human mAb), or 300 μg each of CTLA4-Ig + anti-CHIKV mAb ( Fig. 2A) 3 days after CHIKV infection. Whereas either anti-CHIKV mAb or CTLA4-Ig partially reduced foot swelling at day 7, the combination completely abolished it (10.8 mm 2 versus 6.6 mm 2 , P < 0.0001) relative to untreated or control IgG-treated animals (Fig. 2, A and B) . Thus, anti-CHIKV mAb therapy initiated after disease onset can partially treat the acute clinical arthritis associated with CHIKV infection, and combination therapy with anti-CHIKV mAb and the immunomodulator CTLA4-Ig completely resolves clinical disease in mice within a few days of treatment.

To confirm the activity of the anti-CHIKV mAb in this model, we assessed its effects on viral burden. Treatment with anti-CHIKV mAb (alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig) at day 3 eliminated infectious virus in the joints of infected mice within 2 days, as we observed a ~10,000-fold reduction in the ipsilateral ankle ( Fig. 3A ; P < 0.0005) and a ~100-fold reduction in the contralateral ankle ( Fig. 3A ; P < 0.05). Viral burden in mice treated with only CTLA4-Ig was not reduced in either the ipsilateral or contralateral ankle (Fig. 3A) . Although infectious CHIKV cannot be detected after day 7 in this mouse model [or during the chronic phase in humans (3, 4) ], CHIKV RNA persists in joint tissues for months (28) . Because persistent viral RNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and may contribute to CHIKV arthritis (3, 28) , we tested whether anti-CHIKV mAb treatment would reduce viral RNA levels. Although we did not observe a reduction in viral RNA levels in the ipsilateral foot joints (P > 0.1), other extremity joints exhibited a ~10-fold reduction in viral RNA on day 7 after infection, including the contralateral ankle and ipsilateral wrist ( Fig. 3B ; right ankle, P < 0.005; left wrist, P < 0.05). On day 28, there was a trend toward reduced RNA in distal joint tissues of animals treated with anti-CHIKV mAb, although this did not attain statistical significance ( Fig. 3C ; P = 0.2). Collectively, these results show that treatment with an anti-CHIKV mAb (alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig) rapidly eliminates infectious virus within 2 days and reduces but fails to clear viral RNA in affected tissues.

To begin to define the basis for reduced joint swelling associated with treatment, we analyzed the effects on local cytokine and chemokine production. Using a multiplexed assay, we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in the ipsilateral foot on day 7 after infection in animals that received either control mAb, CTLA4-Ig, anti-CHIKV mAb, or combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb. Monotherapy with CTLA4-Ig reduced levels of CXCL10 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) ( Histological analysis of joint tissues in the ipsilateral foot revealed reduced leukocyte infiltration into the midfoot joints of mice receiving CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb (Fig. 5 , A to F; yellow arrows, moderate to severe synovitis; white arrows, absent or mild synovitis). We next quantitated the number of inflammatory cells per high-power field (HPF) in the synovial space of the midfoot. CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb resulted in decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovial space (52 cells per HPF in the control group, 22 cells per HPF in CTLA4-Ig group, and 9 cells per HPF in the CTLA4-Ig + anti-CHIKV mAb group, P<0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Histological analysis did not reveal evidence of bone erosion, proteoglycan loss, or effects on expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (fig. S1 ). Consistent with a role for CTLA4-Ig in modulating immune cell recruitment, administration of CTLA4-Ig 1 day before infection resulted in reduced swelling on day 7 but not on day 3 ( fig. S2) , a time point at which subcutaneous edema but not immune cell infiltration is observed. To quantitate differences in immune cell infiltration into the entire foot at day 7 after infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry how CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb treatments affected the total numbers of immune cells in the soft tissues of the ipsilateral foot, which included the skin, muscle, and joints. After treatment with CTLA4-Ig or a combination of CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb, we observed about a three-to fourfold reduction in the number of total CD45 + leukocytes (Fig. 6 , A and B; P < 0.0005) with markedly reduced numbers of Ly6C + CD11b + inflammatory monocytes, natural killer cells, and CD8 + T cells, and a nearly complete absence of CD4 + T cells (Fig. 6 , B to G). By contrast, treatment with the anti-CHIKV mAb alone did not reduce the number of infiltrating CD45 + cells or individual leukocyte subsets into the infected foot (Fig. 6 , A to G).

CTLA4-Ig blocks T cell costimulation, but it can also have immunomodulatory effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (25, 29) . Human CTLA4-Ig, which was used in our studies, binds murine B7.1 and B7.2 antigens and can modulate APC function (30, 31) . We assessed APC activation on day 7 after infection but saw no difference in CD80, CD86, and class II major histocompatibility complex marker expression in APCs isolated from the spleen and feet of control and CTLA4-Ig-treated mice ( fig. S3 ). To test whether CTLA4-Ig exerted its therapeutic benefits via T cells, we compared the response to CTLA4-Ig and a control mAb in CHIKV-infected WT and TCRβδ −/− mice, the latter of which lack both αβ and γδ T cells. As we observed a beneficial effect of CTLA4-Ig in WT animals (Fig. 7 , A and C; P < 0.005) but not in TCRβδ −/− mice (Fig. 7 , B and C; P > 0.9), CTLA4-Ig reduces swelling during acute CHIKV infection in part via its action on T cells.

The worldwide emergence of CHIKV has created a need to identify treatments, as epidemiological estimates suggest there are millions suffering from acute arthritis and at least ~400,000 people in the Western Hemisphere suffering from chronic CHIKV arthritis (5, 8) . We reasoned that established therapies used to treat other forms of inflammatory arthritis (for example, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis) also might mitigate CHIKV arthritis. Our experiments identified CTLA4-Ig and tofacitinib as candidate DMARD therapies based on efficacy against acute CHIKV arthritis in mice.

Immunopathology likely contributes to the pathogenesis of CHIKV arthritis. Previous studies using Rag2 −/− animals suggested that the response depends on B and T cells, because Rag2 −/− animals had no ipsilateral foot swelling (20) . Leukocyte subsets infiltrating the peripheral joints of CHIKV-infected mice primarily consist of T cells, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages (4). When we blocked T cell costimulation with CTLA4-Ig, we observed reduced infiltration of T cells and inflammatory monocytes into the joints of infected animals, although this was not sufficient to eliminate the clinical disease completely. Treatment of TCRβδ −/− mice with CTLA4-Ig had no effect on joint swelling, suggesting that CTLA4-Ig ameliorates clinical disease primarily via its action on T cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that joint swelling in the foot of CD4 −/− animals is reduced in severity but not completely controlled (20) . Our findings suggest that other inhibitors of CD4 + T cell function also might limit musculoskeletal disease associated with CHIKV infection. Teo et al. (32) recently demonstrated that treatment with fingolimod, an agonist of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, limited infiltration of CD4 + T cells into CHIKV-infected joints and adjacent muscle in mice, resulting in reduced joint swelling and muscle necrosis.

Previous studies showed that mouse and human antiviral antibodies could prevent CHIKV arthritis in mice when administered before infection (28) or protect against lethality in highly immunocompromised Ifnar1 −/− mice (22, 27) . We found that treatment of WT mice 3 days after CHIKV infection with an antiviral human mAb reduced but did not eliminate joint swelling, although infectious virus could not be detected in the joints within 2 days of therapy. Foot swelling likely depends on multiple factors including synovitis, myositis, and edema resulting from production of proinflammatory cytokines (4). The anti-CHIKV mAb eliminated infectious virus within 2 days of its administration and reduced foot swelling without altering leukocyte infiltration into joints of infected animals, suggesting that leukocyte recruitment is not the only factor that affects disease severity in this model. Local cytokine production in specific compartments (for example, serum, muscles, or joints) independently may affect the virus-induced swelling or edema. Future histological studies may define better the precise mechanism by which neutralization of infectious CHIKV by antiviral antibodies ameliorates foot swelling.

The type I interferon (IFN) response is important in controlling CHIKV infection. Ifnar1 −/− mice lacking type I IFN signaling are highly vulnerable to disseminated infection with CHIKV and succumb within days due to high levels of virus in the brain and spinal cord (33) . Remarkably, treatment with tofacitinib, which blocks JAK/STAT signaling that is downstream of Ifnar1 and other cytokine receptors, reduced clinical disease without ostensible effects on morbidity or mortality. This result may be related to the pharmacodynamics of tofacitinib including its short half-life (13) . Tofacitinib therapy may blunt cytokine production and/or leukocyte infiltration without enhancement of CHIKV replication. Nevertheless, because tofacitinib is known to enhance the risk of some viral infections, including varicella zoster virus (34) , future combination therapy studies with tofacitinib and an antiviral mAb may be warranted.

Anecdotal reports in humans have suggested that methotrexate may be effective for treatment of CHIKV arthritis (16, 35) . In our studies, a low dose of methotrexate did not provide benefit against acute arthritis. It remains possible that methotrexate would show greater benefit if higher doses were used. Mouse models of Ross River virus arthritis previously revealed exacerbation of disease after treatment with etanercept (36), whereas an uncontrolled study in humans suggested that blockade of TNF-α provided some benefit in 13 patients who were diagnosed with a ""chronic rheumatologic disease"" after acute CHIKV infection (35) . However, it is important to note that some patients infected with CHIKV may develop rheumatologic disease sporadically or coincidentally after CHIKV infection. In a controlled study of mice infected with CHIKV, we did not find a benefit of etanercept therapy with acute CHIKV arthritis, but we were unable to assess chronic disease because of the histopathological absence of frank arthritis during the chronic phase. In light of our animal model results and the anecdotal nature of previous human studies, it seems that rigorous, blinded, placebo-controlled studies in human patients are necessary to define which DMARD therapies may be safe and optimal in patients with chronic CHIKV arthritis. CHIKV and related arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the joints and leave persistent viral RNA in the joints and surrounding tissues even in the absence of detectable infectious virus (28) . In previous studies, we found that most CHIKV-infected control C57BL/6 mice did not exhibit histopathological evidence of chronic arthritis 1 month after infection, although there was mild chronic tenosynovitis and myositis in some animals (4) . Because we could readily detect viral RNA in the joints at day 28, our studies suggest that persistent viral RNA may not be sufficient to cause clinically apparent chronic arthritis in mice and that other factors must contribute to pathogenesis. Thus, it remains to be determined whether our combination treatment with an antiviral antibody and CTLA4-Ig has beneficial effects in chronic CHIKV arthritis. Other animal models with more severe chronic disease (for example, nonhuman primates) may be required to address these questions.

The beneficial effects of CTLA4-Ig and antiviral antibody therapy on CHIKV arthritis must be interpreted with caution because there are limitations with the mouse model. Unlike humans, mice are not natural hosts for CHIKV and therefore do not develop the severe, debilitating arthritis that is commonly observed in humans. Because CHIKV causes less severe disease in mice, it remains possible that immunomodulatory therapies, including CTLA4-Ig, may have no or even deleterious effects in humans.

The concept of combination antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy is a unique approach for the treatment of infectious diseases. The near-complete effectiveness of combination therapy in our mouse model of acute CHIKV arthritis has implications for treatment of other viral infections in which both virus-and immune-mediated pathology result in morbidity and mortality (for example, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Given the large number of clinically available biological and small molecular DMARDs, this work may provide greater impetus for studies that test combination antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases.

We initiated this study to determine whether anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy control acute CHIKV arthritis in mice. Our initial observation was that treatment with antiviral antibody reduced infectious viral burden in the ipsilateral joint and that therapy with CTLA4-Ig diminished recruitment of T cells and inflammatory monocytes as well as the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Subsequent histological analysis confirmed these findings. We measured viral titers and RNA in tissues, immunologic parameters (including influx of specific cell subtypes into the joints and surrounding tissues), and cytokine levels. Sample sizes and end points were selected on the basis of our extensive experience with these systems. Mice were age-and sex-matched between groups. Histological analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. Initial footpad measurements were performed by three individuals in an unblinded fashion. However, the measurements after CTLA4-Ig treatment were reproduced by a fourth individual who performed a blinded assessment. Investigators were not blinded when conducting virus tissue burden analysis, cytokine measurements, or flow cytometry analysis. All primary data are in the Supplementary Materials (table S1).

All animal experiments were performed in accordance and with approval of Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, and all mouse infection studies were performed in an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. All experiments were performed with 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice or with TCRβδ −/− mice that were obtained commercially (The Jackson Laboratories).

A recombinant LR2006 OPY1 strain of CHIKV was provided by S. Higgs (Kansas State University) and generated from in vitro transcribed cDNA, as previously described (37) . At 4 weeks of age, mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 10 3 FFU of the LR2006 OPY1 strain of CHIKV in a volume of 10 μl. Infected mice were monitored daily for foot swelling with digital calipers for 28 days. At the termination of experiments, mice were sedated with a ketamin-exylazene cocktail and euthanized, and perfused via intracardiac injection with PBS. Tissues (injected left ankle, contralateral ankle, and ipsilateral wrist) were harvested and snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until processing for RNA isolation. For serum analysis, blood was collected at the time of sacrifice and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g and stored at −80°C. In some experiments, serum and joint tissues were isolated from mice on day 5 after infection for subsequent analysis by focus-forming assay.

Focus-forming assays were performed as previously described (22) . Briefly, tissue homogenates or serum were incubated for 90 min on a monolayer of Vero cells in 96-well plates, and then cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in modified Eagle media supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum(FBS). Plates were harvested 18 to 24 hours later and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The plates were incubated sequentially with chimeric CHK-9 (500 ng/ml) (22) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. CHIKV-infected foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 macro-analyzer (Cellular Technologies Ltd).

RNA was extracted from tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quantity of CHIKV RNA was determined by qRT-PCR using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems) with an E1-specific primer/probe set (38) . Two microliters of the isolated RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR and compared to a standard curve generated from RNA isolated from a CHIKV stock to determine FFU equivalents.

4N12 is a human IgG1 mAb that neutralizes CHIKV infection and has been described previously (27) . Antibody was purified from hybridoma supernatants by protein G affinity chromatography. Methotrexate, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and etanercept were obtained from the Center for Advanced Medicine Rheumatology Clinic (St. Louis, MO). Naproxen sodium and methylprednisolone acetate were purchased from Sigma. The isotype control antibody [humanized anti-West Nile virus antibody (E16)] was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein G affinity chromatography (39) .

Infected mice were sacrificed and perfused by intracardiac injection of 4% PFA at the indicated days after infection. The infected ankle/foot tissue was dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 48 hours, followed by decalcification in 14% acid-free EDTA for 10 to 14 days. Decalcified tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated by light microscopy. Embedding, sectioning, and staining were performed by the Musculoskeletal Histology and Morphometry Core at Washington University School of Medicine. All samples were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse microscope equipped with a QICAM 12-bit camera (QImaging) and processed with QCapture software using the same exposure times.

Ankles were harvested from euthanized infected mice at day 7 and collected in 500-μl PBS and homogenized using a MagNA Lyser (Roche). Cytokine levels were measured using Luminex technology with a Bio-Plex Pro mouse cytokine 13-plex assay (Millipore).

Mice were sacrificed 7 days after inoculation and perfused with PBS. The inoculated foot was disarticulated at the ankle without fracturing the bone. Cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue were everted but still attached to the distal foot and digits during digestion. Tissues were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in digestion buffer [RPMI, type I collagenase (2. 

All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. For viral burden analysis, cytokine measurements, and numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test, ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's post hoc analysis. P < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. Results in (C) to (J) are from at least two independent experiments with n = 28 per treatment group for measurement data from days 0 to 7 and n = 7 or 8 for viral burden analysis on days 7 and 28.

Clinical development of monoclonal antibody- based drugs in HIV and HCV diseases,"Today there are many licensed antiviral drugs, but the emergence of drug resistant strains sometimes invalidates the effects of the current therapies used in the treatment of infectious diseases. Compared to conventional antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used as pharmacological molecules have particular physical characteristics and modes of action, and, therefore, they should be considered as a distinct therapeutic class. Despite being historically validated, antibodies may represent a novel tool for combatting infectious diseases. The current high cost of mAbs' production, storage and administration (by injection only) and the consequent obstacles to development are outweighed by mAbs' clinical advantages. These are related to a low toxicity combined with high specificity and versatility, which allows a specific antibody to mediate various biological effects, ranging from the virus neutralization mechanisms to the modulation of immune responses. This review briefly summarizes the recent technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, and the current status of mAb-based drugs in clinical trials for HIV and HCV diseases. For each clinical trial the available data are reported and the emerging conceptual problems of the employed mAbs are highlighted. This overview helps to give a clear picture of the efficacy and challenges of the mAbs in the field of these two infectious diseases which have such a global impact.","The innate immune response is the first-line defense in determining the outcome of an infection. Infectious agents contain conserved motifs on their surface that react with conserved pattern recognition Toll-like receptors of the host. This interaction initiates a powerful innate immune response. Moreover, the infectious agent's surface proteins and carbohydrates come into contact with B-cell receptors, membrane-bound immunoglobulin of isotype M (IgM) or D (IgD), and often induce potent antibody responses, which take some weeks to fully develop [1] .

When a vertebrate organism encounters a pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, it generates a polyclonal antibody response against numerous epitopes on different antigens during infection; therefore, polyclonal serum contains a large and diverse population of antibodies, which also include neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Thus, polyclonal serum-derived biotherapeutic products can contain various nAbs against multiple and distinct epitopes; these nAbs provide strong protective activity due to additive or even synergistic effects on neutralization. However, in this type of product the vast majority of their constituent specific antibodies are non-neutralizing, since they are directed against misfolded protein or against epitopes on native surface proteins for which antibody binding is not protective [2, 3] . Furthermore, for some viral and bacterial infections, no correlates of protection have been established; therefore, the significance of antibody titers, apart from indicating past exposure, is not clear.

Mechanisms of immunological escape can explain why total antibody titers are not always protective. Many infectious organisms, including viruses, can constantly mutate surface proteins and exploit glycans to shield important epitopes, diverting the antibody response away from functionally important epitopes in favor of immunogenic irrelevant epitopes [4] .

Thanks to their protective properties, the administration of hyperimmune sera from immunized animals or immune human donors, named 'serum therapy', was the first effective treatment of infectious diseases. Later, the advent of antibiotic therapy with the advances in vaccine design has meant that serum therapy was almost abandoned for many infectious diseases. Nevertheless, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin preparations are still used to treat different bacterial toxins and virus related diseases, including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [5, 6] .

Today, the ability to rapidly generate and manipulate antibodies with a defined epitope recognition, named ""monoclonal antibodies"" (mAbs) (Figure 1 ), has opened a new window of opportunity for a rematch of antibodies in clinical practice. This achievement has been possible thanks to advances in cellular biology and biotechnology (Figure 2) , and also to improved purification techniques which have made these therapeutics safer, less immunogenic and more effective. MAb preparations have many advantages over immune sera-derived preparations which can vary due to both time and the source of origin, since different hosts mount different antibody responses. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-tolot variability and low risk of pathogen transmission. Another advantage for mAb preparations is the much Figure 1 Schematic structure of a mAb. All immunoglobulins are composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains, linked by disulphide bonds (black dashed bars). The heavy chains contain one variable domain (VH) and three or four constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3 and CH4) depending on antibody isotype. By contrast, the light chains contain only one variable domain (VL) and a single constant domain (CL). Within the Fab region, at the end of the two arms of the Y-shaped molecule, the variable domain of a heavy chain pairs with the light chain variable domain to form the antigen-binding site. In more detail, within the matched V regions, three short polypeptide segments on the heavy chain and three on the light chain form the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which dictate the precise antigen-binding characteristics of the antibody. On the other end, the Fc domain, which includes the sites for interaction with the complement system and Fc receptors, mediates effector functions determining the fate of the bound antigen.

greater activity per mass of protein since all the Ig molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus toxin as 100 to 170 mg of tetanus immunoglobulins [7] . Neither does mAb therapy have the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, which significantly limited the latter's usefulness [8] .

In recent years, mAbs have emerged as a new class of biological drugs in oncology as well as in immune and inflammatory diseases, albeit their development in infectious diseases has been slower. To date, the only mAb approved in this field is palivizumab, an anti-RSV mAb licensed for prevention of severe respiratory disease in high-risk infants and immunocompromised adults. Now the scenario is gradually changing and there are many antibodies against viruses and bacteria in various stages of clinical development. This trend has also been influenced by the development of different scientific disciplines, which makes it possible to study and dissect the function of individual microbial structures supporting Figure 2 Evolution of mAbs linked to the need to decrease their immunogenicity. Different methods to obtain mAbs are depicted. Mouse mAbs, the 'hybridoma' cells derived from the stable fusion of immortalized mouse myeloma cells with lymphocytes from immunized mice, are screened to identify individual clones producing identical antibody to a single antigenic determinant [118] . Chimeric mAbs, the murine constant regions of both heavy and light antibody chains (mCH and mCL), are replaced with human counterparts (hCH1, hCH2, hCH3 and hCL1), leaving intact the murine variable portions (mVH and mVL) [119] . Humanized mAbs, only the CDRs of the murine mAbs (mCDRs) from both the mVH and the mVL, are 'grafted' into a human backbone antibody [120, 121] . Human mAbs, 1)Human memory B-cells isolated from patients are immortalized by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, and then screened for specific antibody production [122] . 2) Transgenic mice, obtained by a genetic replacement of the mouse immunoglobulin genes with human counterparts, are used to obtain fully human mAbs by traditional hybridoma technology [123] . 3) Antibody libraries, constructed by in vitro combinatorial assembly of human immunoglobulin variable-region gene (V genes) and cloned to provide the display onto phage surfaces, are subjected to a panning against an antigen in order to select specific clones [124] . The first mAbs of each category approved for clinical use are shown. Palivizumab is the first and, so far, only mAb approved for infectious diseases. The endings used to name the different types of mAbs are also indicated. the development of more targeted drugs. There are excellent reviews about this topic [6, 9] .

In this review we focus on the mAb-therapies now underway in clinical trials (Table 1 ) designed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious diseases. Both these worldwide epidemics require new strategies due to the lack of a definitive cure and effective vaccines, to the continuous emergence of drug resistant variants, to the toxicities of licensed drugs and to the need to ensure a treatment for all patients. In this context, antibodies represent an intriguing alternative as therapeutics; in their favor are their different resistance mechanisms and a more favorable toxicity profile when compared to other available drug classes, fitting them for use in conjunction with the current chemotherapy by slowing the onset of resistance and possibly enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

The antibody structure comprises a pair of identical heavy and light chains linked by disulphide bonds held in a Yshaped arrangement (Figure 1 ). The fragment antigen-binding (Fab) portion, the region that binds the antigen, is composed of one variable and one constant domain of both the heavy and the light chain. The remaining constant sections of the longer heavy chains form the tail of the Y, termed the crystallizable fragment (Fc) region, which provides the signal for effector functions.

Antibodies can provide protective effects through various mechanisms [10] . Viral neutralization is generally meant as the ability of an antibody to provide sufficient steric interference to disrupt the interaction between a microbic antigen and its ligand in experimental conditions in vitro. This activity is clearly associated with protection, thanks to their Fab domain alone, both in natural infection and after immunization. Virus infection includes sequential steps beginning with attachment to cell-surface receptors and ending with delivery of the viral genetic material into the cytoplasm [11] . Fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a basic entry mode for enveloped viruses, such as HIV and HCV [12] , which still differ in specific aspects of viral entry and assembly, thus offering unique therapeutic opportunities. The cell surface is certainly more directly accessible for the action of the antibodies; therefore, the phase of virus entry is one of the most important targets in preventing viral infection at the origin, and many known nAbs act at this step. For the same reason, inhibition of the release of progeny virus is another possible mechanism of neutralization, as demonstrated by antibodies directed against influenza A virion surface neuraminidase [13] . In HIV and HCV fields, no virus release inhibiting antibodies have been identified to date. The interaction of HIV envelope surface protein gp120 with its host receptor, CD4, on human T cells triggers conformational changes in the envelope, resulting in exposure of a transient binding site for co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. This in turn promotes additional conformational changes in virus gp41 protein which allow it to insert its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane to initiate membrane fusion and viral entry into host cells. NAbs can inhibit viral infection by several different mechanisms in parallel with the steps that allow the viruses to enter into cells ( Figure 3 ). They can directly block virus attachment to target cells by interfering with virus-receptor interactions, as in the case of nAbs against the CD4-binding site on HIV gp120 [14] . This same goal can also be achieved by directing the antibodies to the virus receptor and/or co-receptor on host cells. MAbs can also block fusion at the cell membrane at the post-binding/pre-fusion stage, as exemplified by anti-CD4 [15] and/or anti-CCR5/CXCR4 (CCmotif receptor 5/CXC-motif receptor 4) mAbs, under development [16] . Again, mAbs directed to the external proximal membrane region of HIV gp41 can interfere with conformational changes needed for membrane fusion [17] .

Unlike HIV, HCV entry into target cells occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the viral particle [18] . Subsequent release of the viral genome into the cytosol requires the pH-dependent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Current models suggest that HCV circulate as LipoViral-Particles (LVPs) in the vascular system, these consisting of lipoproteins in complex with virus particles. Following localization to the surface of hepatocytes through interactions of LVPs with glycosaminoglycans and the low density lipoprotein receptor, specific binding of the E1 and E2 virus surface glycoproteins with the host SR-B1 scavenger receptor and CD81 occur [19] . Subsequently, viral particles are translocated to regions of the membrane possessing tight junction proteins occludin and claudins; the binding to these receptors results in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As for HIV, mAbs directed against spike viral proteins, as well as against host receptors, may act at an early stage of infection by preventing the binding of the virus on the cell surface. For example, antibodies recognizing the CD81-binding site within the envelope glycoprotein E2 have been shown to block viral entry, as have a number of anti-receptor antibodies targeting CD81 [20, 21] and SR-BI [22] . Some antibodies may act by blocking conformational changes and/or the requisite interactions between the viral and endosomal membranes required for fusion; although as yet no fusion determinant within the envelope glycoproteins has been defined.

Host protection in vivo is more complex and involves the interaction of antibodies with cells and molecules of the innate immune system. The antibody can exert protective actions through an Fc region-mediated recruitment of other components of the immune system, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Receptors for the Fc segment of IgG (Fcy receptors; FcγRs) are expressed on the surface of different types of cells, including natural killer cells (NK), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. With the exception of γδT cells, FcγRs are not normally found on T lymphocytes. Similarly, the receptor for Fc segment of IgA, the FcαR, involved in phagocytosis and induction of microbe killing, is expressed on monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils [23] .

The ADCC process is triggered by the interaction between the Fc region of an antibody bound to a nonself antigen exposed on host cells, and the Fc receptors on immune effector cells. The subsequent release of cytokines and cytotoxic granules containing perforins and granzymes promotes the death of the target cell. CDC is initiated by complement component C1q binding to the Fc region of IgG, which is in turn bound to the foreign antigen on the cell surface. This triggers a proteolytic cascade to activate the complement, so leading to the formation of a membrane attack complex that kills the target cell by disrupting its cell membrane. The Fc region can also mediate complement binding to and deposition on free virions, which can cause a direct virotoxic effect or inhibit virus binding to cells. Moreover, the so-called opsonization process, consisting of the binding of antibody Fab portion to the antigen following by the interaction of Fc domain to an Fc receptor on phagocytes, is a powerful mechanism to enhance the phagocytosis [9] .

With respect to HIV, a potential role for ADCC in modulating the course of HIV infection was first proposed on the basis of studies showing an inverse association between ADCC antibody levels and the clinical stage of disease. The strongest evidence for a role for ADCC antibody in disease progression comes from a study by Baum et al. of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [24] . In that study, rapid progressors had significantly lower ADCC antibody titers against CEM. NKR cells coated with gp120 than did non-rapid progressors at corresponding visits or non-progressors at any visit. Morever, HIV-infected individuals with spontaneously undetectable viremia were shown to have higher ADCC antibody levels than viremic subjects [25] .

In the context of HCV infection, Fc-mediated effector functions, although less well understood, can still have an important role. Sera from both the acute and chronic phase of infection can mediate ADCC via binding to viral protein E2 expressed at the cell surface [26] , while several E2-specific mAbs are able to induce CDC of E2-expressing cells [27] . Optimizing non-nAb effector functions, such as ADCC, CDC and fagogocytosis, may prove critical in the design of new effective anti-HCV therapeutic antibodies [28] . (1), as well as by binding to the viral receptor or co-receptor on host cell surface (2) . Some antibodies, can neutralize viral infection through interfering with conformational changes required for membrane fusion and subsequent release of the viral core into the target-cell cytoplasm; this postbinding neutralization may occur at the cell surface (3), or inside the endosomes for the viruses (for example, HCV) whose entry into the cell requires an endocytosis step (4). Antibodies recognizing viral or host proteins expressed on infected cell surface can exert protective actions through the Fc-mediated effector functions (for example, CDC, ADCC) (5). Again, mAbs may prevent the release of progeny virions (6) . At the bottom the antibody neutralizing effects on the viruses before cell binding, including the direct virolysis by CDC and the mAb-mediated enhanced phagocitosis, are shown (7) . In Panel B, the possible mAb-mediated immunomodulary therapies are depicted. In some chronic viral infections, virus-specific immune cells may persist in a 'non-functional' state, because of an imbalance of immunoregulatory signals involving multiple inhibitory and activating receptors, triggered by soluble factors and/or cell surface ligands. Therapeutic approaches using specific mAbs to block host immunosuppressive molecules (antagonism) or to trigger activating receptors (agonism) may be a valid strategy to restore immune cell function and treat various chronic viral infections.

system is the exhaustion of virus-specific T cells. Exhaustion consists of a progressive dysfunction characterized by the inability to proliferate and to produce key antiviral and immune stimulating cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-γ), or to lyse infected cells [29] .

A feature of functional exhaustion is that it affects many antiviral properties of both mouse and human CD8+ T cells. Loss of effector functions proceeds in a hierarchical manner starting with defects in IL-2 production and proliferation, followed by the decrease of TNF production. Cytotoxic activity is also lacking in exhausted human CD8 + T cells. At a severe stage of exhaustion, IFN-γ production is eventually compromised, with exhausted T cells ending up deleted if the high antigenic load persists [30] . Exhaustion can also occur in CD4+ T cells in both mice [31] and humans [32] . Probably the best explanation for this progressive dysfunction and loss of effector T cells is the continuous triggering of virus-specific T cell receptors owing to a high antigenic load in persistently infected hosts without a critical rest period. The current consensus is that functional exhaustion is a way of limiting the magnitude of effector T cell responses. Although this may safeguard against autoimmune responses, it may also compromise effective immunity against persistent infectious agents and tumors [29] .

Exhausted T cells are subject to complex layers of negative regulation. This involves signaling through multiple inhibitory receptors that inhibit functional and proliferative responses. The CD28 family member programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has been shown to be the most highly expressed inhibitory receptor on CD8+ T cells during chronic infection, and to have a major role in regulating T cell exhaustion during infection [33, 34] . Increased expression of PD-1 by T cells also occurs during HBV and HCV infections [35] [36] [37] . Several other inhibitory receptors have also been shown to induce T cell unresponsiveness during chronic infections. These receptors include cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) [31, 38, 39] , T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 3 (TIM3) [40, 41] , and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) [38] . In addition, certain cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) as well as regulatory T cells, may also contribute to the lack of T cell functionality during situations of high antigenic burden [42] .

There is intriguing evidence that blockade of the inhibitory receptor could restore antigen T cell responses. For example, blockade of the PD-1 signaling pathway improves antigen-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mice [31, 34] and in humans with chronic HIV [32, 43, 44] , HBV [45] and HCV [36] infections. This effect was synergistically improved in LCMV infected mouse following the simultaneous blockade of the T cell inhibitory receptors PD-1 and LAG-3, thanks to which a diminished viral load in vivo was observed, although blocking LAG-3 pathway alone had little effect on the severity of exhaustion [34] . Moreover, mAbmediated blocking of CTLA-4 pathway in vitro augments HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell function suggesting that the immune modulation of this target may also provide a clinical benefit in infected individuals [39] . Another example is the manipulation of signals mediated by glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR), a recently identified member of the TNF receptor superfamily, preferentially expressed on subset CD4 +CD25+ regulatory T cells. GITR signals break the suppressive activity of this subset. In fact, an agonistic anti-GITR mAb immediately injected after viral infection significantly increased the number of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ [46] .

One must remember that the manipulation of immunological responses could have detrimental effects on the host, as highlighted by the recent tragic human trial of TGN1412. This is a mAb against human T cell costimulatory molecule CD28 developed by TeGenero to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, on the basis of its capability of inducing preferential activation and expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells, as observed in rodent models. TGN1412 has been termed a 'superagonist' because it binds to CD28 and activates T cells without the need for prior T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. In a Phase I clinical trial (in March 2006), following administration of TGN1412, six healthy young men suffered a life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) involving multi-organ failure, something unpredicted by the preclinical studies. It is now clear that in the presence of TGN1412, activated CD4+ effector memory T (T EM ) cells were the source of the cytokines that mediated the CRS observed in the volunteers. Treg cells were not able to prevent systemic inflammation, probably because the balance between activated Treg cell and T EM cell numbers is disadvantageous for humans compared with laboratory rodents. Furthermore, in macaques, but not in humans, CD4+ T cells lose CD28 expression during their differentiation into T EM cells; this detail, however, had gone unnoticed despite many years of primate testing. In conclusion, this model failed to prevent the disastrous case above [47] .

In view of these events, such a risk needs to be carefully assessed if the modulation of immune inhibitory or activating receptors is used for increasing the functional activity of virus-specific T cells in order to avoid nonspecific inflammation. These therapeutic approaches are being carefully evaluated for cancer as well as for HIV and HCV chronic viral disease.

Given the potential antiviral effect of the antibodies, viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to protect themselves from antibody binding. One of these, the viral receptor glycosylation, is widely shared among different viruses. Carbohydrates are poorly immunogenic and, therefore, do not stimulate the response of type B lymphocytes and simultaneously hide the underlying protein structures. HCV E2 protein contains up to 11 potential Nlinked glycosylation sites. Specific glycans mask the CD81binding site and, therefore, nAb epitopes [48] . Lipid shielding may represent an additional strategy used by HCV to evade the antibody response. Current data suggest that key neutralizing epitopes are less accessible on LVPs. More recently, HCV has been found capable of direct cellto-cell transmission, which is largely resistant to antibody neutralization [49, 50] . HIV envelope protein is also glycosilated and changes occur in the frequency and position of glycans HIV gp120; these 'evolving glycan shields' have been shown to decrease sensitivity to antibody neutralization [51] . Other factors of antibody escape for HIV are: trimerization of the gp 120 and gp 41 that can shield vulnerable epitopes better exposed on the individual monomeric subunits; kinetic and spatial constraints that impede antibodies from accessing potentially vulnerable sites during receptor binding and membrane fusion process; the variable loops of gp120 that are a prime target for nAbs, which usually have a very narrow breadth of reactivity [52] . Finally, the high mutation rate of many viruses, including HIV and HCV, which undergo rapid antigenic variation, allows them to escape neutralization, constituting a significant hurdle for nAbs development.

All these problems may be counter-balanced by selecting nAbs which target conserved and more accessible areas of viral particles, and/or by using mixtures of nAbs which target various key epitopes. In fact, it has been demonstrated that combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses, including influenza [53] , coronavirus [54] and LCMV [55] , and that broad neutralization in the sera of most of some individual HIV infected donors can be associated with single or four to five principal specificities [56] .

Recent studies have indicated that nAbs play a critical role in HCV disease outcome. Viral clearance was associated with a rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies in the early phase of infection with some evidence that these antibodies are broadly reactive [57, 58] . In contrast, chronic HCV infection was characterized by absent or low-titer neutralizing antibodies in the early phase of infection and the persistence of infection, despite the induction of crossneutralizing antibodies in the later phase of infection. Current understanding of the nAb response raised against HCV suggests that E2 is the major target, and that multiple epitopes within E2 may be targeted by both linear-and conformation-dependent antibodies. Predominantly, these neutralization epitopes overlap with CD81binding sites and clearly demonstrate a role in inhibition of entry. Currently, one of these mAbs, MBL-HCV1, is being investigated in clinical trials in the prevention of liver re-infection after transplantation, for which novel antiviral preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In fact, re-infection of the graft is universal, being characterized by accelerated progression of liver disease; IFN-based therapies exhibit enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy in these patients [59, 60] . MBL-HCV1 is a fully human monoclonal antibody isolated from transgenic mice and directed to a highly conserved linear epitope of HCV E2 glycoprotein. It is able to neutralize pseudoviruses from multiple HCV genotypes and has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HCV genotype-1 infection in HCV naïve chimpanzees. A phase I open-labeled, dose escalation study was performed in healthy adult volunteers starting with 1 mg/kg and escalating to 3, 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg after a 10-day post-infusion safety review. MBL-HCV1 was well-tolerated without any seriously adverse effect event. Based on the favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data, a phase II study of MBL-HCV1 in chronically infected HCV patients undergoing liver transplantation has been planned [61] .

In the context of HIV disease, despite intensive study over two decades, only a small number of broadly neutralizing mAbs have been identified from infected patients and little is known about their activity in vivo. These antibodies are able to inhibit viral entry of most primary HIV isolates in vitro [17, [62] [63] [64] and the exceptionally high level of mutation found in their genes may reflect chronic immune responses to HIV and persistent hypermutation and selection [65] . A number of trials evaluating different formulations of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are now in progress.

The first trial assessed a chimeric monoclonal antibody CGP 47,439 to the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 over 21 weeks [66, 67] . Subsequent studies evaluated the kinetics of monoclonal antibody F105 directed to the CD4-binding site of gp120 [68, 69] , a humanized antibody binding to the V3 epitope GPGRAF [70] . Finally, a humanized mAb, KD-247 is under evaluation in clinical trials. Its epitope was mapped to 6 aa, IGPGRA, at the tip of the V3 loop of Envelope protein and demonstrates crossneutralizing activity against HIV-1 isolates in clade B [71] .

A drug based on the mAb cocktail mode is also currently in clinical development. In this regard it has already been observed that in HIV neutralization assays the effectiveness of a mix of broadly neutralizing antibodies increased synergistically compared to the effect of the individual antibody. The synergy effect was relatively weak, with a maximum of two-to four-fold enhancement, between antibody pairs, thereby increasing neutralization titers about 10-fold in triple and quadruple antibody combinations [72] . However, the use of antibodies in the cocktail mode, as an approach to improve their effectiveness, is already recognized for other pathogens or toxins. In the case of tetanus toxin, it has been reported that combining the action of three out of four antibodies increased the neutralizing activity up to 200 times [73] . In the case of botulinum toxin, neutralizing activity has been reported up to 20,000 times higher when using a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies [74] . Instead, other studies have demonstrated that the combination of two potent neutralizing mAbs against HIV, VRC01 and PG9, although not synergistic, can mediate additive neutralization viral activity and provides an improved neutralization coverage of 90% to 97% of viral strains by combining independent epitope targeting [75] .

In a proof-of-concept passive immunization trial with humans, it has been demonstrated that a cocktail of the three broadly neutralizing mAbs -2G12, 4E10 and 2F5was able to delay viral rebound in patients whose infections were fully suppressed by antiretroviral treatment before administration of the antibodies [76] . Interestingly, the main antiviral effect observed was primarily attributable to the 2G12 antibody, a mAb that binds to a noncontinuous epitope composed of glycosylation residues distributed over the envelope protein gp120 [64] , whereas the other two mAbs, 4E10 [77] and 2F5 [78] , recognize two adjacent highly conserved epitopes on the membrane-proximal ectodomain of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. In earlier phase I clinical trials, safety and tolerability were demonstrated [79, 80] . During a longterm multiple dose phase II clinical trial, high doses of the three neutralizing antibodies were given in combination to 14 HIV-1-infected individuals at weekly intervals over three months. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that repeated infusions at high dose levels were well tolerated by the patients and did not elicit an endogenous immune response against the monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies showed distribution and elimination kinetics similar to those seen for other human-like antibodies, though monoclonal antibody 2G12 had a significantly longer elimination half-life (21.8 +/-7.2 days) than monoclonal antibodies 4E10 (5.5 +/-2.2 days) and 2F5 (4.3 +/-1.1 days) [81] . Furthermore, analyses of the emergence of mutations conferring resistance to these three mAbs were performed. Sequence analysis of the 2G12 epitope relevant N-glycosylation sites of viruses derived from 13 patients demonstrated that mutations in these sites are associated with resistance. In vitro selection experiments with isolates of four of these individuals corroborated the in vivo finding that virus strains rapidly escape 2G12 pressure. Importantly, in vitro selection with 2F5 and 4E10 demonstrated that resistance to these nAbs can be difficult to achieve and can lead to selection of variants with impaired infectivity [82] . Moreover, generation of viruses resistant to the triple-combination was a slower process characterized by recurrent loss of virus replication; some generated triple-resistant viruses seemed to be impaired in their replicative fitness, and none of the patients developed detectable viruses that escaped neutralization by all three mAbs within the 77day observation period [83] .

As is true with all mAbs designed for infectious disease, the development of a successful vaccine would reduce the need for them. However, given the scarcity of drugs in the field of virology and given the slow progress on the HIV vaccine front, the development and use of microbicides, compounds that could be applied topically to prevent HIV transmission, is one of the possible strategies to counter the spread of HIV. In this regard, mAbs could be proposed as suitable components of microbicides to fight HIV entry at mucosal surface. A safety study of P2G12 mAb administered vaginally in healthy women has been completed. P2G12 is the broadly neutralizing 2G12 mAb manufactured from tobacco plants [84] . Most mAbs in clinical trials have been produced using a system called Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO-Cell) fermentation [85] , including 2G12 used along with 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies as a cocktail. The CHO-Cell fermentation production method is very expensive and cannot produce enough mAbs on a scale required for the global market; therefore, plant manufacture of such mAbs may hopefully offer some solutions to lower production costs and improve output. The process yields five grams of purified antibody from 250 kg of tobacco and production costs could be 10 to 100 times lower than when using conventional bioreactors. This study has been designed to confirm the safety of a vaginally delivered mAb P2G12 derived from plants and manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (a quality standard used for the manufacture of medicinal products). The medicine is the first plant-produced antibody to be greenlit for clinical testing by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Agency (MHRA). It took about a year to get that agency's stamp of approval because it required assurances that the drugs did not contain allergenic plant sugars or pesticides. No matter how it is produced, P2G12 antibody has not been shown to actually prevent HIV-1 infection in clinical trials; thus a version made from tobacco plants would not see approval any time soon. P2G12 would also likely be just one ingredient in a cocktail of plant-produced antibodies [84] .

To eliminate or reduce the development of escape variants it has been proposed that targeting the conserved cellular receptors of the virus may open new avenues for a viable antibody therapy for HIV infection. HIV entry into CD4+ T cells requires the presence of a co-receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, on the target cell. Thus, based on this hypothesis, mAbs directed against CD4 and against the co-receptor CCR5, have been developed and are being analyzed in clinical trials.

CD4 functions as a co-receptor, physically associating with the TCR during Ag recognition by binding to a nonpolymorphic component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Ibalizumab, a humanized mAb, binds CD4 on T cell surface away from the binding site for MHC class II molecules. It does not inhibit gp120 binding to CD4 but appears to exert its antiviral property by post-binding conformational effects that prevent CD4bound gp120 from interacting with CCR5 or CXCR4 [19, 86] . By contrast, other monoclonal antibodies, that competitively inhibit gp120 binding, interfere with MHC class II immune function [87, 88] . The reported human experience with Ibalizumab consists of three clinical trials. During phase I study, it was observed that peak mean reductions in viral load occurred later in the higher dose cohorts, whereas the extent and duration of viral suppression correlated with the degree of CD4+ cell coating by ibalizumab, which was maintained longer in the higher dose cohorts, with a duration of 15 to 34 days. Peak increases in CD4 counts at one day after infusion, well before the peak declines in viral load; this suggests that the increase may have been due to redistribution of CD4+ cells from lymphoid tissue rather than regeneration of CD4+ cells in the setting of viral suppression. A multidose study demonstrated continued safety over an extended treatment period and provided data on the development of ibalizumab resistance. Resistance testing showed reduced susceptibility relative to baseline. Resistant isolates remained dependent on CD4 for viral entry, suggesting that resistance did not develop through the use of alternative receptors. Genotypic analysis was unable to identify mutations, diagnostic of ibalizumab resistance. Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of ibalizumab's anti-HIV-1 effect, the development of resistance is associated with a reduction in the maximum percentage inhibition rather than the shift in the IC50 characteristic of competitive inhibitors [89, 90] . The half-life of IgGs under normal physiological circumstances is two to three weeks [91] . In contrast, the average half-life of ibalizumab is 3 to 3.5 days [89] . This is consistent with observations of other anti-CD4 antibodies, in which internalization or shedding of the receptor results in more rapid antibody degradation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase IIa study has evaluated the ibalizumab efficacy, the results showing a considerable viral load reduction with respect to the placebo arm [92] .

CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that mediates activation and migration of T cells and other leukocytes. CCR5using (R5) viruses typically mediate transmission and then predominate through the progression to symptomatic disease. Viruses can use an alternative chemokine receptor, CXCR4, either exclusively or in addition to CCR5. The CXCR4-using virus can be present initially, but tends to result in an increasing proportion of subjects in the later stages of the disease [93] . CCR5 co-receptor antagonists represent an emerging antiretroviral treatment class and the first to target a host molecule.

Currently, two anti-CCR5 mAbs are being investigated. One of these is CCR5mAb004, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody with robust activity against a diverse panel of HIV-1 isolates; it synergizes in vitro with other ARV classes and appears safe and effective in reducing HIV viral load. High levels of receptor occupancy were observed for 14 to 28 days with the highest dose cohorts, suggesting the potential for weekly, fortnightly or even monthly dosing [94] .

The other anti-CCR5 mAb is PRO 140, a humanized mAb that also synergizes with small-molecule CCR5 antagonists in laboratory studies [95] . PRO140 is being investigated in two modes of administration: the classical intravenous (IV) form, and subcutaneous (SC) form. The trial involving SC administration is the first to bear the proof of concept for a mAb administered subcutaneously in HIV-1 infected subjects as a potent and longacting antiretroviral agent.

An IV form of PRO 140 tested as monotherapy in HIV-1 subjects with only R5 virus detectable [96] demonstrated potent and prolonged antiviral activity, with a 1.83 log10 mean reduction in HIV-1 RNA and safety relative to placebo. The successive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled IIa trial examined the antiviral activity, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous infusions of up to 10-mg/kg of mAbs. All PRO 140-treated subjects treated with 10 mg/kg experienced a 1-log10-unit reduction in HIV-1 RNA level, there being just one exception; a post-study analysis using the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay determined that this subject had dual/mixed virus at screening. There was no change in co-receptor tropism or emergence of PRO 140-resistant virus during the course of this study, supporting the view that PRO 140 broadly inhibits R5 HIV-1 with a high barrier to resistance. The maximum tolerated dose of IV PRO 140 has not been determined, suggesting a sizeable margin of safety for PRO 140 SC administration study [97] .

The study involving PRO 140 SC administration showed virologic suppression between successive doses and no changes in R5 viral susceptibility to PRO 140 following three weeks of monotherapy, indicating no adaptation of virus to use CCR5 in the presence of drug. Pharmacokinetic data suggest the possibility of a drug regimen administered fortnightly for HIV infected individuals. Proteins and other macromolecules drain from SC sites into both blood capillaries and the lymphatic system. In animals, proteins with molecular weights of greater than 16,000 daltons have been observed to drain primarily into the lymphatic system following SC administration [98] . Such proteins transit through lymph fluid and typically are not absorbed significantly into the blood until they reach the thoracic duct. Since the molecular weight of PRO 140 is approximately 150,000 daltons, a substantial amount of SC PRO 140 can be expected to drain into the lymphatic system and potentially encounter CCR5+ cells in lymphoid tissues prior to reaching the bloodstream. For these reasons, serum concentrations may not provide a full picture of the overall exposure following SC dosing of PRO 140. SC infusion is currently used by individuals with primary immunodeficiency to self-administer at home significantly larger amounts (approximately 11 grams) and volumes (approximately 70 mL total, up to 15 mL/site) of the weekly SC-administered immunoglobulin [99] . Self-administration of 324 mg SC PRO 140 would be much simpler in comparison. Therefore, SC PRO 140 offers the potential for significant dose-dependent HIV-1 RNA suppression and may offer greater convenience for many patients in terms of patient selfadministration [100] .

The SC injection mode was chosen in order to evaluate PRO140 safety and efficacy as an adjunct to an oral antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected injection drug users with viral rebound and documented poor adherence to the previous antiretroviral regimen. Therefore, a phase IIb, national, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study was initiated and is currently recruiting participants. Given the complications that arise from the occurrence of drug resistances, the use of antibodies together with combined therapy increases the drug number and, therefore, the therapeutic opportunities. In particular, in the case of CCR5 inhibitors, one report has demonstrated that resistance to CCR5 inhibitors may increase the sensitivity of the resistant virus to certain neutralizing antibodies [101] .

Compared to CCR5, CXCR4-based blocking agents as therapy against HIV are less attractive due to the crucial role of CXCR4 in many biological processes, and the absence to date of known naturally occurring mutations leading to the inactivation of CXCR4 gene in humans. Moreover, one major problem is linked to the fact that, whereas R5 viruses are found on their own in 50% or more of patients, viruses that using CXCR4 co-receptor (X4) usually are present mixed together with R5 viruses; therefore, the use of CXCR4 specific mAbs could result in only little or transient effect on the overall viremia, also complicating the evaluation of pharmacological activity. However, antibodies against CXCR4 might still provide some benefits for some HIV positive patients when co-administrated with CCR5 antagonists, if the safety of such combinations is established [93] .

There is a pressing need for antiviral agents that are effective against multiple classes of viruses. Broad specificity might be achieved by targeting phospholipids that are widely expressed on infected host cells or on viral envelopes. Phosphatidylserine (PS), the most abundant anionic phospholipid of the plasma membrane, is segregated at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of resting mammalian cells. Loss of PS asymmetry occurs during apoptosis, cell injury, cell activation and malignant transformation, and results from inhibition of the translocases or activation of PS exporters, or lipid scrambling enzymes, such as scramblases. After enveloped viruses replicate within the host cell, they create their 'envelope' by carrying along part of the host cell's membrane upon exiting. As a result, the target phospholipid becomes exposed on the surface of the virus as well as on the infected host cell [102] .

Bavituximab is the first in a new class of patented antibody therapeutics that target and, preferentially bind, to these exposed phospholipids. It has demonstrated broad therapeutic potential across multiple oncology indications and represents a new approach to treating viral disease, too. Bavituximab is currently being evaluated in randomized phase II clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, for therapy of chronic HCV infection and for HIV/HCV co-infection. The therapeutic effect of bavituximab appears to be due to ADCC of tumor and virus-infected cells. Since PS exposure is an early event during virus infection, ADCC may limit virus spread. Furthermore, in the infectious disease setting, bavituximab causes opsonization and clearance of infectious virus from the bloodstream, leaving less virus to infect other tissues. Three completed phase I HCV clinical trials have shown that bavituximab is generally safe and well-tolerated. Reductions in serum HCV RNA levels were also observed. A randomized phase II clinical trial with previously untreated HCV genotype-1 infected patients was designed to determine the early virologic response (EVR) rate after 12 weeks of therapy with bavituximab in combination with the antiviral drug ribavirin and safety profile versus pegylated IFN-α-2a and ribavirin. The results show that the combination of bavituximab with ribavirin has a better safety profile than an IFN-containing regimen. However, the EVR development in the bavituximab-containing arm was later than the IFN-containing group; therefore, a longer-term evaluation is needed to adequately compare their effectiveness. In addition, the lower dose level appears to be more active in HCV patients than the high dose does. Such results suggest that future studies evaluating longer bavituximab treatment durations at or around the lower dose level in combination with ribavirin and potentially direct acting antivirals in certain patient populations may hold promise as IFN-free HCV therapeutic regimens [103] .

Targeting PS on cells infected with multiple different viruses and on virions themselves is a promising antiviral strategy. Although resistance has developed in monotherapy trials with ibalizumab (an anti-CD4 antibody), host-derived antigen, such as anionic phospholipids, on virus-infected cells are independent of the viral genome and as a consequence the acquisition of drug resistance should be theoretically less problematic than with agents that target virus-encoded components.

Since the discovery of PD-1 as an inhibitory receptor associated with T-cell dysfunction, the roles of various inhibitory receptors on virus-specific CD8+ T cells have been extensively studied in human chronic viral infections, such as HCV, HBV and HIV infections. As blocking the inhibitory receptors in vitro restores the functions of virus-specific T cells, novel HIV and HCV treatments based on blockade of several immune checkpoint molecules are being investigated. In particular, mAbs interfering with two major inhibitory networks of the B7:CD28 family, namely the PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways [104] , are currently being studied in clinical trials, to evaluate their safety and efficacy. These mAbs recognize the PD-1 or CTLA-4 receptor and neutralize the binding with their respective ligands.

The PD-1:PD-L1 pathway delivers inhibitory signals which regulate T cell activation. As a result it performs a key role in various processes, namely in multiple tolerance checkpoints that prevent autoimmunity, in the suppressive tumor microenvironment, in the immune-mediated tissue damage, in host defenses aimed at eradicating microbial pathogens and tumors and finally, in T cell exhaustion that contributes to both lack of viral control during chronic infections and to T cell unresponsiveness [105] . In cancers, a strong correlation between increased PD-L1 expression on tumors and a negative survival prognosis in patients has already been observed. Various studies indicate that mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors [106] . In HCV infection the relationship between the PD-1 expression and the outcome of the acute HCV infection was questioned; subsequently, recent studies have shown that the progression of acute HCV infection to the chronic stage is associated with a high level of PD-1 on HCV-specific CD8+ T cells, whereas the clearance of HCV infection is associated with lower levels of PD-1 expression [36] .

Given these premises, MDX-1106, a fully human antibody also known as ONO-4538, and CT-011, a humanized antibody, both interacting with PD-1 receptor, are being developed as a treatment for cancer disease and for therapy of chronic HCV infection [107] . To date, most clinical experience with PD-1 blockade has been gained with MDX-1106 in the tumor setting. Drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxic effects occurred in 14% of patients, in whom there were drug-related adverse events of special interest, those with potential immune-related causes; they included pneumonitis, vitiligo, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis and thyroiditis. Pneumonitis (3%) ranged from isolated radiographic abnormalities to progressive, diffuse infiltrates associated with clinical symptoms in a small number of patients. Although three deaths occurred, mild-to-moderate pneumonitis was managed successfully with either observation or glucocorticoids. However, objective responses were observed in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; overall, an adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use [108] . Besides these studies, an ongoing phase I safety trial with active hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patients has been designed to assess the safety and tolerability profile of MDX-1106 [109] . Clinical studies to evaluate the use of CT-011 in HCV disease have also been initiated [110] .

CTLA-4 is up-regulated on activated T cells and inhibits T cell activation by reducing the production of IL-2 and arresting cell cycle progression. CTLA-4 has also been shown to have an impact on T cell responses in animal tumor models and humans [111, 112] . Human trials that used a blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAb demonstrated a reduction in tumor mass and clinical benefit in a substantial minority of treated subjects. Studies of the role for CTLA-4 in chronic infections have produced mixed results. In chronic HIV infection, many studies indicate that impaired CD4+ T cell function is associated with viral persistence [113] , although the function of CTLA-4 in causing HIV persistence by suppressing T cell function remains unclear [114] . On the other hand, CTLA-4's role in chronic HCV infection seems to be more defined. The HCV-specific CD8+ T cells found in the livers of chronic HCV patients overexpressed not only PD-1, but also CTLA-4. Co-expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 was observed in liverinfiltrating lymphocytes, but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes [36] , suggesting the phenotypic differences of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in different in vivo compartments. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expressing HCV-specific T cells were profoundly dysfunctional [115] .

Tremelimumab is a fully human IgG2 mAb directed against CTLA-4. While a phase II study for HIV disease with this drug has been withdrawn prior to enrollment, clinical trials for HCV disease are still underway. Tremelimumab binds to activated T lymphocytes and results in inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated down-regulation of Tcell activation. It also acts as an IL-2 stimulant. It was generated, using XenoMouse technology (Figure 2) , as an anticancer agent and is currently in worldwide phase III development for malignant melanoma, phase II development for colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, gynecological cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in the US and other countries. It is also being investigated for prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer in various countries. As for anti-PD-1 antibodies, immune-related adverse effects of tremelimumab are of special interest because of its presumed mechanism of action. Most of the experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in cancer, particularly in melanoma. These effects mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis and inflammatory myopathy also have been occasionally reported. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade; they are generally mild, reversible and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids [116] . In December 2008, Pfizer initiated a phase II trial in patients with latestage unresectable liver cancer who also have hepatitis C infections. The primary endpoint of this single-armed study is the ability of tremelimumab to produce tumor responses among HCV-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and to produce changes in hepatitis C viral load. The first results indicate that tremelimumab demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with a promising antitumor efficacy against HCC in 17 patients, as well as an intense antiviral activity. In fact, a significant and progressive decline in serum HCV viral load was observed, this being associated with an increase in anti-HCV immune response in 76% of patients [117] .

Since there are multiple levels of immunoregulation, a synergistic use of antibodies against different checkpoint molecules might represent the next stage in immunotherapy for chronic infectious diseases, as evidenced from ex vivo studies about the combined PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in HCV disease [36] . Furthermore, because the host mechanisms that inhibit T cell activity are common and conserved aside from specific virus-encoded immune evasion strategies, the antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors may prove extremely versatile drugs potentially effective against multiple classes of viruses.

The need to treat HIV and HCV infectious diseases, two epidemics of global impact, has reawakened interest in mAb-based therapy, supporting a variety of clinical studies. The results that are emerging, will help to create models for the further development of such drugs and extend their use against other viruses as well.

Although the mAb production costs are high, increasing advances of biotechnology and production systems will make them more competitive on the market, and new approaches, such as using mAb cocktails or combining mAbs with available drugs, will improve effectiveness. Treatment with mAbs as part of a drug regimen is the most likely future for mAbs that block HCV and HIV infection in order to avoid viral escape, while chronic treatment could attract further investments from pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, broad spectrum mAbs, such as bavituximab and immunomodulatory mAbs, could be useful against a whole range of diseases, thus extending marketability and profit margins.

This review has focused on the use of intact mAbs as a novel emerging and versatile class of pharmaceuticals. It is important to note, however, that biotechnology also provides the opportunity to build various antibody formats whose improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties could be co-opted in the fight against infectious diseases. resistance to antiretroviral drugs; the mechanisms of immune reconstitution; and, finally, operational and implementation research in resource limited settings. He chaired or participated in many international clinical studies on antiretroviral therapy, and he is currently the coordinator of the -European Commission-funded HIV Clinical Trials Network (NEAT).

Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses,"The emergence of new pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been successfully used to treat various diseases, particularly cancer and immunological disorders. Antigen-specific mAbs have been isolated using several different approaches, including hybridoma, transgenic mice, phage display, yeast display, and single B-cell isolation. Consequently, an increasing number of mAbs, which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection, have been developed. In this paper, we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mAb discovery, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mAb production, and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases. We also review the application of recently developed human mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases.","Emerging infectious diseases are infectious diseases caused by previously unknown or unnoticed pathogenic microorganisms. Such pathogens, which are mostly viruses, could be newly discovered or are previously known and under control but have recently reemerged with rapidly increasing incidence and/or geographic ranges. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases pose serious challenges to global public health. Three recent examples illustrate the challenges presented by emerging infectious diseases. First, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged as a pandemic in 2002 and 2003, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a previously unknown virus. This virus was first isolated in 2003 from the specimens of three patients with SARS [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), SARS infected more than 8000 people and caused at least 813 deaths [6] . A specific therapeutic agent or effective vaccine against SARS was unavailable at the time of the initial outbreak. Fortunately, SARS was successfully contained, and no additional SARS outbreaks have been reported since 2004. The second example comes from the Ebola virus outbreaks. Although the first recognized outbreak of Ebola virus occurred in 1976, a novel variant of the Ebola virus emerged in West African nations in March 2014 [7] . WHO estimated that as of March 27, 2016, 28 646 cases and 11 323 deaths have occurred during this recent outbreak [8] . The third example is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus. A decade after the SARS epidemic, MERS first appeared in Saudi Arabia and soon spread to 26 other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, Yemen, and Lebanon. MERS led to the infection of over 2000 individuals with~35% fatality rate (http:// www.who.int/csr/don/21-september-2017-mers-uae/en/). These three recent outbreaks clearly showed that emerging diseases pose a considerable threat to public health.

Effective treatments need to be developed in the face of the tremendous challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies have been recently used in the treatment of various infections. For example, mAb treatment is correlated with increased antibody levels and decreased Ebola viral load without observed adverse effects [9] . This review focuses on the application of mAbs as therapeutic agents against emerging viruses, as exemplified by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus. We begin with brief historical remarks and then highlight important characteristics of these three emerging viruses and their candidate mAbbased therapies.

Historical perspective: from antibodybased serum therapy to mAb therapy Active vaccination stimulates the production of antitoxins (antibodies) in serum. In the 1890s, Emil von Behring and Paul Ehrlich first used serum from immunized horses to treat diphtheria [10] . The serum contained a small amount of neutralizing antibodies that could neutralize toxins associated with the pathogenesis of diphtheria. Serum therapy thus provided a new treatment option against severe bacterial infections. Antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class are typically preferred as therapeutic antibodies. IgG is one of the most abundant proteins in human serum. IgG has neutralizing effects, activates complement systems and effector cells to kill pathogens and infected cells, and triggers phagocytic cells [11] .

After its initial successes, serum therapy was extensively used for the prophylaxis and therapy of viral and bacterial diseases. Although it was effective against several diseases, it had numerous side effects and thus was almost abandoned after the discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s. Moreover, antibiotic therapy was more desirable than serum therapy for the treatment of bacterial infections given its lower production costs and toxicity and fewer side effects. However, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. In addition, the extensive use of antibiotics has led to the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, despite its toxicity-related problems, including the risk for allergic reactions, lot-to-lot variation, and uncertain dosing, antibody-based serum therapy is still being used for the prevention or treatment of several viral diseases, including cytomegaloviral infection, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, and measles [12] [13] [14] .

The fundamental limitation of serum therapy is attributed to the polyclonal nature of antibodies. Functional antibodies in a polyclonal preparation typically account for a small portion of the total antibodies; the remaining antibodies are not only ineffective but may even be toxic or immunogenic [12, 13] . Therefore, the clinical application of antibodies remained limited until the 1970s when antibody-based therapies were rejuvenated by the discovery of technologies for mAb production.

In the 1970s, Kohler et al. generated mouse hybridoma cells through the fusion of mouse myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells after immunization with sheep red blood cells [15] . Hybridoma cells could specifically produce anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies. The development of hybridoma technology allowed the production of mAbs, which are homogenous antibodies with the same specificity and a single Ig class and isotype. These mAbs were quickly applied in clinical settings. However, the application of these mAbs to humans led to a human antimouse antibody response (HAMA reaction). The strategy for attenuating or avoiding the HAMA reaction is to either humanize the mouse mAb or develop fully human mAbs (hmAbs). With the development of hmAbs over the 1970s to the 1990s, mAbs have been used in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, auto-immune diseases, and infectious diseases [13, 14] .

Although human-mouse chimeric mAbs (by replacing mouse IgG Fc with that from humans) or humanized mAbs (by replacing human complementarity-determining regions with that from mice) are effective in clinical settings, they still contain portions of mouse origin, which can induce immunogenicity and HAMA reaction. In 1985, Smith et al. developed the phage display technique [16] . This technique is mainly characterized by expression of a specific protein on the phage surface and the integration of the protein gene into the phage DNA [17, 18] . These processes led to the generation of phage-displayed antibody libraries with random pairs of antibody heavy and light chains, enabling the use of appropriate target antigens to screen specific antibodies with high affinity to the antigen ( Fig. 1) [19, 20] . The phage display technology is extensively used to generate fully human antibody libraries, which consequently provide a rapid and highly effective approach for obtaining specific antibodies against infectious diseases.

Humanized transgenic mice also provide a valuable platform for the generation of fully human therapeutic antibodies. In humanized transgenic mice, the endogenous mouse antibody gene is replaced by human Ig loci [21, 22] . Transgenic mice are then immunized with the target antigen to ensure the expression of specific human antibodies against the target antigen. Kymab and VelocImmune mice are representative transgenic mouse models [21, 22] that produce high yields of high-affinity human antibodies. However, the effects of the differences between mouse and human immune systems, especially antibody affinity maturation pathways, on clinical outcomes remain unknown.

Several other methodologies, including yeast display and single B cell isolation, have been recently used to successfully identify candidate therapeutic antibodies. The principles of yeast display are similar to that of phage display. The most common yeast surface display system involves the connection of the displayed antibody fragment to the C terminus of the Aga2p subunit, which is linked to Aga1p subunit by two disulfide bonds [23, 24] . The yeast display system is ideal for antibody affinity maturation due to the effectiveness of flow cytometry in discriminating between strong and weak affinity binders [25, 26] .

The initial step in single B-cell isolation is the selection of antigen-positive B cells through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, antigen-coated magnetic bead systems, microengraving, or cell-based micro-array chip systems [27] [28] [29] . B cells could be immortalized through Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation [30, 31] . Heavy-and light-chain sequences are then obtained through reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this single B-cell isolation can be used to efficiently isolate potent neutralizing antibodies, it is time-consuming and requires a Fig. 1 Workflow of mAb discovery using a phage display library. First, human heavy and light chain genes are obtained from the B cells of donors and are then inserted into a phagemid vector. Antibodies in Fab or single-chain variable region fragment (scFv) format are displayed on the surfaces of phages. The target antigen is coupled to magnetic beads or coated on plates, then cyclically panned for the selection of phages with the desired target specificity and affinity. Enriched binders are selected for subsequent cloning, expression, and characterization. [34, 35] . The virulence of these five Ebola viruses varies, and ZEBOV has the highest mortality rate of 90% [7] .

The genome of the Ebola virus encodes seven structural or multifunctional proteins: envelope glycoprotein (GP); nucleoprotein (NP); RNA polymerase L; and viral proteins vP30, vP24, vP35, and vP40 [36, 37] . GP is embedded on the virion surface and is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. It is encoded by 676 amino acids. After transcriptional modifications, GP consists of soluble GP and small soluble GP. GP function is closely associated with receptor binding and viral entry and with coagulation abnormalities in patients infected with the Ebola virus. In addition, GP-mediated cytotoxicity is associated with the pathogenesis of different Ebola subtypes. GP is thus an ideal target for anti-Ebola drugs [38, 39] . Furthermore, theoretical analysis has revealed that the antigenic epitope of GP is largest out of all epitopes in the Ebola virus [40] [41] [42] . A vaccine test based on GP and NP showed that GP has good immunogenic effects. In other words, GP alone is enough to induce the production of protective antibodies against a fatal Ebola virus attack. Meanwhile, immunization with NP alone does not exert a protective effect, further suggesting that GP is an ideal target for the development of neutralizing antibodies against Ebola [40, 43, 44] .

The development of mAb therapies against EVD is urgently needed to prevent further EVD outbreaks. Highaffinity neutralizing mAbs that specifically target the main GP epitopes of the Ebola virus have been identified. KZ52 is an antibody obtained from phage display libraries that were generated using the RNA of donors who had recovered from Ebola infection. KZ52 could neutralize Ebola virus to 50% at 8 nmol/L and could also protect guinea pigs from lethal ZEBOV challenge. However, this antibody failed to provide protection when tested in a rhesus macaque model. To better understand the mechanisms that underlie the neutralization effects of anti-Ebola mAbs, researchers analyzed a panel of mAbs that reacts with GP. They found that two neutralizing mAbs, KZ52 and JP3K11, neutralized the Ebola virus through two fundamentally different mechanisms. Specifically, KZ52 inhibits the cathepsin cleavage of GP, whereas JP3K11 recognizes post-cleavage GP. This result suggested that multiple epitopes need to be targeted for successful Ebola treatment. A promising approach is to develop a multi-mAb cocktail against the Ebola virus.

MB-003 and ZMAb are representative cocktail antibodies against the Ebola virus. ZMAb, a cocktail antibody developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutial, consists of three monoclonal neutralizing antibodies: 1H3, 2G4, and 4G7 [45] . MB-003, which is also composed of three mAbs, namely, c13C6, h-13F6, and c6D8 [46] , was developed by the Canadian Public Health Agency. These two cocktail antibodies were isolated from mice immunized with ZEBOV GP protein trimer [45, 46] . In the cynomolgus macaque infection model, when treatment was initiated at 48 h post challenge, ZMAb exhibited 50% protection rate, while MB-003 showed 67% protection rate [45, 46] . However, the virus escaped in one of the Ebola virusinfected animals treated with MB-003, resulting in five nonsynonymous mutants in the antibody-targeting sites. These mutants decreased antibody binding in vitro [47] . This finding highlights the importance of selecting different targeting sites for antibody cocktails to minimize the potential of viral escape.

2G4, 4G7, and c13C6 have been combined into a novel cocktail antibody called ZMapp [48] . In contrast to ZMAb, ZMapp contains the c13C6, not 1H3, antibody. ZMapp exhibits potent neutralizing activity against the Ebola virus. A rhesus macaque primate infection model showed that the protective effect of ZMapp is stronger than those of MB-003 and ZMAb. Eighteen Ebola virus challenged macaques received intravenous injections of ZMapp at 5, 8, and 11 days post-infection (50 mg/kg per dose) [48] . Compared with previous EVD treatment methods, the time of injection was several days later in this model, but all 18 rhesus macaques were cured after treatment [48] . Two American patients, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were infected with the Ebola virus while working in West Africa and returned to the United States for treatment [9] . They were treated with ZMapp, representing the first time that ZMapp was used in humans. The physical condition of the two patients improved after treatment with ZMapp [9] . This finding suggested that in an emergency case, antibodies that are effective in several animal models could be used to save human lives. However, in these cases, whether the antibody or the immune system is responsible for recovery remains unclear.

Recently, another neutralizing antibody against Ebola virus, mAb114, was isolated from the blood of two survivors of the 1995 EVD outbreak in Kikwit; this antibody could protect macaques five days after infection with the Ebola virus [49] . Structural analysis revealed that mAb114 mediates virus neutralization by inhibiting the binding of protease-cleaved GP to its receptor [50] . In addition, heterologous (animal-derived) polyclonal antibodies exerted neutralizing effects on the Ebola virus, and 100% survival was achieved in an animal study in which Ebola virus polyclonal antibodies were delivered 6 h after viral challenge [51] .

In November 2002, a SARS outbreak, which was initiated by SARS-CoV, first occurred in Guangdong Province, China [4] . SARS-CoV is highly contagious and causes severe clinical symptoms that could result in death. According to the WHO, SARS-CoV spread to 32 countries and regions and led to the infection of more than 8000 people and the death of 813 people, with a mortality rate close to 10% [2, 3, 52] .

SARS-CoV belongs to the Coronavirus family, Coronavirus genus. Its genome is approximately 30 kb in length. Given that the nucleotide composition of the SARS-CoV genome is drastically different from any known coronavirus sequence, it could not be attributed to any known group of existing coronaviruses at that time of initial outbreak [2, 53, 54] . The SARS-CoV genome encodes more than 10 proteins. Previous studies on coronaviruses have shown that their envelope protein has a strong immunogenic effect [55, 56] . SARS-CoV binds to its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its envelope glycoprotein [52] . Early work showed that hmAbs exhibited inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV. Thus, the development of potent inhibitory mAbs against SARS-CoV is of high priority.

Several groups have successfully developed hmAbs against SARS-CoV. 80R, which was identified from two nonimmune human antibody libraries, is a recombinant human scFv against the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV [57] . 80R has a potent neutralizing effect on SARS-CoV and strongly inhibits syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2 [2] . In another study, EBV was used to immortalize memory B cells from a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV infection. Through this strategy, the mAb S3.1 was isolated, which exhibited high viral neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV [30] . In a SARS-CoV infection mouse model, S3.1 was transferred to naïve mice through an intraperitoneal route. After two days, the mice received an intranasal challenge dose of 10 4 TCID50 of SARS-CoV. S3.1 injection protected all the mice from the recurrence of viral challenge [30] . However, 80R and S3.1 were unable to neutralize the GD03 strain of SARS-CoV, which was isolated from an index patient of the second SARS-CoV outbreak [58, 59] . Therefore, our group expressed a fragment containing residues 317-518 of the SARS-CoV RBD in insect cells [60] . Using this selecting antigen, we then identified m396 from a large human antibody Fab library constructed from the B lymphocytes of healthy volunteers [60] . We found that m396 achieved 100% inhibition of different SARS-CoV subtypes at a low concentration and that m396 injection completely protected mouse models of SARS-CoV against SARS-CoV infection [60] . Thus, 80R, S3.1, and m396 have the potential to be used alone or in combination to develop potent antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV.

In September 2012, the Erasmus Medical Center isolated a new β-coronavirus from a patient in Rotterdam City. The isolated β-coronavirus was later named MERS-CoV by the International Commission for Classification of Coronavirus Study Group [61, 62] . The symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV are similar to those of patients with SARS-CoV and mainly include fever, coughs, and shortness of breath; patients with severe MERS-CoV infection experienced renal failure [63] . The lethal rate of MERS-CoV is approximately 35%, which is considerably higher than SARS-CoV [64, 65] . As of September 21, 2017, 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 722 related deaths, have been reported to the WHO (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-september-2017-mers-uae/en/). MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of β-coronaviruses. The MERS-CoV genome encodes highly conserved polymerases and helicases, a highly differentiated spike protein (S), five helper proteins, a highly conserved envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N) [61] . The S protein exists as a trimer on the viral surface and contains two functional subunits, namely, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, and the proximal membrane side of the S2 subunit is responsible for mediating membrane fusion [66] . MERS-CoV interacts with receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) through the RBD on its S protein [67] to mediate its adsorption onto the cell. DPP4 is highly conserved in mammals and is mainly expressed in the lung, kidney, liver, small intestine, pancreas, and other epithelial cell surfaces [68] . After adsorption, the virus then fuses into the cell membrane and enters the cell to initiate infection [66] .

In 2014, several different groups developed potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV [69] [70] [71] . For example, we isolated dozens of antibodies with high neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV from a fully human antibody library, which we established using phage display [69] . Among those antibodies, we found that mAb m336 has the strongest neutralizing activity that reached the pmol/L level [69] . The structure of Fab m336 in complex with the MERS-CoV RBD suggested that the m336 epitope almost completely overlaps with the natural RBD on the viral surface [72] . Except for one amino acid mutation in its heavy chain and several in its light chain, the sequence of the m336 antibody is almost the same as that of the native germline predecessor antibody. m336 can be used to develop a highly effective anti-MERS-CoV drug given that germline antibodies usually have low immunogenicity and high safety level. In another study, Jiang et al. described the development of potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing mAbs using the yeast display method [70] .

The mAb LCA60 was rapidly generated by using Cellclone technology from immortalized B cells derived from human donor recovering from MERS [73] . LCA60 has subnanomolar (0.12 nmol/L) affinity for the S protein of MERS-CoV [73] . Pascal et al. also generated hmAbs from humanized mice by using VelocImmune technology; these mAbs also showed therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection [74] .

Given the developments in the field of inhibitory mAbs, the influence and use of mAbs in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for emerging infectious diseases are expected to expand.

Research on inhibitory mAbs has flourished given the rapid development of novel technologies for the production of antigen-specific mAbs and the increasing need for novel mAb-based therapies against infectious diseases. Antiviral mAbs can be generated using several different methods (e.g., phage display, humanized mouse) with varying advantages and disadvantages (Table 1) . Among these methods, large naïve antibody phage library-based technologies have enabled the rapid development of highaffinity hmAbs against emerging viral diseases that occur in an outbreak setting. This low-cost method can be used to isolate candidate mAbs within several weeks without the need for blood from infected patients or elaborate screening and animal feeding facilities.

Numerous mAbs with inhibitory effects on infectious diseases are now available and are promising candidate therapeutics. Their clinical applications, however, are hindered by the expenses associated with their development and production. African countries, where infectious diseases are highly prevalent, constitute the largest market for mAb-based therapies. However, many patients in these countries cannot afford mAb-based therapies. In the long run, governments should subsidize treatment cost, while companies and academics should improve technology to decrease the cost of therapy. For example, the American and Australian governments supported the development of m102.4, a potent mAb against the Hendra virus. m102.4 has been approved for human use after being successfully tested in two animal models [75, 76] and the completion of human phase I clinical trial with 40 volunteers.

Another promising avenue is the development of small antibody constructs, such as single-domain antibodies, which are significantly cheaper to produce than conventional full-sized mAbs. Currently, the therapeutic use of such antibody constructs has been limited by their unsatisfactorily short in vivo half-lives. This disadvantage may be overcome by antibody engineering technologies, e.g., by conferring neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding capabilities to enable FcRn-mediated recycling and prevent endosomal degradation [77, 78] . Low-cost and long-lasting novel antibody constructs may have great potential and extensive application in the treatment of emerging viral diseases.

Clinical Medicine Review Advancements in Nucleic Acid Based Therapeutics against Respiratory Viral Infections,"Several viruses cause pulmonary infections due to their shared tropism with cells of the respiratory tract. These respiratory problems due to viral infection become a public health concern due to rapid transmission through air/aerosols or via direct-indirect contact with infected persons. In addition, the cross-species transmission causes alterations to viral genetic makeup thereby increasing the risk of emergence of pathogens with new and more potent infectivity. With the introduction of effective nucleic acid-based technologies, post translational gene silencing (PTGS) is being increasingly used to silence viral gene targets and has shown promising approach towards management of many viral infections. Since several host factors are also utilized by these viruses during various stages of infection, silencing these host factors can also serve as promising therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid-based technologies such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes), and ribozymes have been studied and used against management of respiratory viruses. These therapeutic nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered through the airways. Studies have also shown efficacy of gene therapy in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as models of respiratory diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles and influenza. In this review, we have summarized some of the recent advancements made in the area of nucleic acid based therapeutics and highlighted the emerging roles of nucleic acids in the management of some of the severe respiratory viral infections. We have also focused on the methods of their delivery and associated challenges.","Many viruses show tropism for cells of the respiratory tract that supports viral entry and subsequent infection. Infection with such respiratory viruses often leads to seasonal epidemics and in some cases threatening pandemics casing significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory viruses generally spread rapidly due to their mode of transmission which can be as simple as inhaling droplets containing the viral particles or through physical contact with contaminated items. The spread can be Dicer binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cleaves it into short pieces of ∼20 nt called siRNA.

One strand of the RNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins and binds to the target mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved by the nuclease activity of the RISC.

The long dsRNA introduced in cells directly or via any virus or transposons, is immediately recognized by RNA binding domain (RBD) of the enzyme Dicer, which contains an endonuclease catalytic domain. The dsRNA then gets cleaved into the short siRNA molecule which gets bound by a multiprotein component complex referred to as RISC (RNA induced silencing complex). One of the siRNA strands then guides and aligns the RISC complex on the target mRNA. Thereafter, the Dicer recruited Argonaute protein (which is also an RNase) slices the target mRNA thus causing gene suppression and consequent decrease in protein levels ( Figure 1 ). The highly specific cleaving ability of the siRNAs makes them a potent prophylactic and therapeutic treatment option in targeting the disease-causing genes. However, optimization is required during siRNA design to avoid any offtarget effects and minimize the possible side effects in the host cells. The presence of a double stranded RNA as a consequence of viral infection triggers RNA interference (RNAi). The host enzyme Dicer binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cleaves it into short pieces of ∼20 nt called siRNA. One strand of the RNA associates with the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins and binds to the target mRNA. The mRNA is then cleaved by the nuclease activity of the RISC.

Bacteria and viruses cause respiratory infections in the airways [25] . Antimicrobial resistance has made treatment difficult for many infectious diseases including respiratory infections and RNAi therapeutics have proven to be effective against infections [26] . Since RNAi therapy target RNA, these are very advantageous over conventional small molecule drug used for therapy against respiratory diseases. Since the first time RNAi was used against P and F sequence of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [27] , there has been an increase in the number of studies related to the potential of RNAi technology in the treatment of other respiratory viral infections including influenza [28] [29] [30] [31] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [32] . RNAi molecules are designed specifically to target specific sequences of viral mRNA and thus can also be used efficiently against mutated viral strains when compared to other antiviral drugs.

Seasonal influenza viruses are one of the foremost public health concerns, especially influenza type A viruses that have been associated with the annual epidemics worldwide [33] . The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused high morbidity [34, 35] and mortality [36] [37] [38] , and was a reminder that influenza viruses are highly unpredictable [3, [39] [40] [41] and continuous efforts are needed to manage pandemic scenarios in short time. Antiviral drugs that are currently approved to treat influenza include the Adamantanes (M2 ion-channel protein inhibitors) and the neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir [42] . Few viral strains have now been found to be resistant to these drugs [43] [44] [45] , thus emphasizing the need for urgent development of new antiviral drugs. Though the virus can sometimes inhibit the effect of host gene silencing, there has been studies using synthetic siRNA [46] . Due to the importance in viral replication and progression, the most commonly targeted viral regions are the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the polymerase basic protein (PB1), and the polymerase acidic protein (PA) which are highly conserved across different subtypes of influenza virus strains [47] . The first animal study using RNAi against influenza was described in 2003 where authors showed the targeted mRNA degradation using NP-and PA-specific siRNAs resulting in global inhibition of other viral RNA transcription. The reason for such significant inhibition is that the newly synthesized NP and PA proteins are indispensable for most influenza viral strains [48] . In another study, the polyethyleneimine (PEI) complex containing siRNA against NP and PA were administered intravenously to the mice either 3 hours (h) before or 5 h after influenza virus (Strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)) infection. The combination of these siRNAs enhanced the antiviral effect. The study also indicated that RNAi mediated by these siRNAs could partially control influenza virus even when administered after the viral infection in mice. The study also emphasized on long lasting effect of short hairpin RNAs (NP and PB shRNAs) expressed from DNA vectors [49] . These observations suggested that the siRNAs, when coupled with appropriate carriers and optimized formulations, may provide the basis for preventive treatment against influenza virus. Administration of siRNAs using lipid carrier to influenza-infected mice by hydrodynamic injection and intranasally has efficiently saved animals against highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (IAV) such as the H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 subtypes [50] . Studies have also targeted the NS1 gene of influenza A virus and demonstrated a significant decrease in viral replication in experimental mice [51] . In a follow-up study from the same group, the M1 gene of Influenza A virus was targeted using siRNA-Rz chimeric construct which lead to a considerable decrease in virus titer in experimental conditions [52] . There is a growing numbers of studies in search of potential usage of siRNAs both in vivo and in vitro models for the treatment of influenza [50, 53] . Although there are few setbacks in the usage of these therapies due to the innate immune response rather than RNAi mediated viral inhibition, the advanced chemically modified RNAi molecules with a potential to trigger less immune response could be helpful in addressing this concern [54, 55] . Some studies have also carried out siRNA mediated knockdown of cellular proteins. The authors targeted the Ran-binding protein 5 which resulted in the delayed accrual of the viral RNA polymerase complex in the infected cells thereby confirming that cellular genes along with viral genes, can also be targeted for therapeutic intervention in viral diseases [56] .

RSV infection is one of the leading causes of respiratory distress in children [57, 58] and in adults, the infection leads to self-limited upper respiratory illness [59] . However, premature infants and immunocompromised patients especially those with heart and lung disease can have severe RSV infection [60] . Current treatment plans for RSV are of limited benefit and include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics [57] for bacterial co-infections. To date, there is unavailability of a licensed vaccine available against RSV [61] thus presenting the urgent need to develop effective RSV therapeutics and vaccines to protect both the pediatric and the adult population. Since RSV replication takes place in respiratory epithelium, the nasal delivery of the RNAi molecule can be helpful in inhibiting RSV replication [62] . In a study in the year 2005, siRNA against viral phosphoprotein (P protein) was given intranasally to mice, with and without the help of transfection agent and was proved to be effective against both RSV and parainfluenza virus (PIV). The antiviral activity of the siRNA on the animal model was comparable to that in cell culture. The experiment also revealed competitive RNAi machinery when siRNAs against two different viruses were used in dual infection setting. It was observed that an excess of one siRNA toned down the inhibitory effect of the other. The study also suggested that if properly designed, low dosages of inhaled siRNA might prove to be an effective antiviral treatment against respiratory viral infections in humans. When compared to complexed siRNA, the naked siRNA showed approximately 70-80% efficiency. Moreover, the study also revealed that the administration of siRNA before RSV infection was more effective than treatment after infection [63] . Since siRNA to P protein could target only a few viral strains, another siRNA that could target viral nucleocapsid protein (N protein) was designed. The usage of this siRNA (ALN-RSV01) developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals not only decreased the viral load significantly in animal model but also the phase I clinical study of ALN-RSV01 proved to be successful with less side effects. The phase II trial has also been successful where ALN-RSV01 was given to the healthy adults in the form of nasal spray daily for two days prior to and for three days after RSV infection. The results showed that, compared to the placebo group, the subjects treated with ALN-RSV01 had a significantly lower number of RSV infections [64] showing the antiviral efficacy of ALN-RSV01. Reduced acquisition of the viral infection was observed within 3-4 days after virus inoculation and continued till the end of the study. The ALN-RSV01 also entered phase II b clinical trial in the RSV-infected lung transplant patients [65] . Though the marginal reported decrease in new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in these patients was statistically non-significant, it was still promising and futuristic. ALN-RSV01 has not been associated with any significant adverse event in adult population; however, safety and efficacy of the drug is yet to be disclosed for the highly susceptible pediatric population. Since the usage of siRNAs targeted against cellular proteins required by influenza virus showed significant results, the same approach can be applied in case of RSV too. However, it should be kept in mind that these cellular genes/proteins should not be indispensable for cell survival. Among such proteins are the actin regulatory proteins, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) and Zyxin, and thus siRNA against these proteins can be used against RSV [66] [67] [68] [69] . These proteins are non-essential for cell survival but they are required for maintaining normal physiological conditions; hence, only a short exposure of specific siRNAs can be afforded under critical conditions. SARS-CoV is another major cause of respiratory distress. As there is no good vaccine or effective treatment for SARS-CoV infection, relying on RNAi therapy to counter the infection may prove to be an important tool to counter infection. Detailed description of the SARS-CoV genome allowed immediate advancement in the SARS-CoV RNAi based therapeutic. Clinical trials are underway, but some success has been achieved in cell culture models [70] [71] [72] . Identification of candidate nucleic acid paves the path for rational design of siRNAs against viral segments. Wang et al., in 2004, generated six antiviral RNAi activators that targeted various specific sites within the SARS-CoV genome [70] . pSR02 and pSR03, had similar antiviral effect against the ORF 1b sequence. In studies using Vero cell cultures and animal models, these RNAi activators decreased viral replication and weakened the cytopathic effects demonstrating high efficacy of the designed synthetic siRNAs against the virus [71] . The inhibitory effect of the siRNA designed against S sequence was remarkable [72] . Recently, the effect of these synthetic siRNAs with cognates in the ORF 1b and S regions of the SARS-CoV genome have also been investigated on murine and rhesus macaque models [32, 73] . The otherwise unmodified short duplexes had dTdT overhangs at their 3 ends. The intranasal administration of the dextrose soluble siRNAs to SARS-CoV-infected cells inhibited replication of SARS-CoV effectively [73] . In another study, siRNAs specific for protein responsible for viral entry (HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein), showed a significant inhibition of viral replication in virus-infected cells [74] .

Adenoviruses are also known to cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Several studies have utilized siRNAs against adenovirus to inhibit their replication. In one such study, the authors designed several siRNAs against the early (E1A) and the late (hexon, IVa2) genes of adenovirus 5 [75] and showed variable degree of inhibition of virus replication. The study also revealed that silencing the late gene was more efficient than silencing the early gene in obstructing virus replication [75] .

Ribozymes are RNA molecules that have catalytic activity just like the DNAzymes. Since their discovery, the role of RNA catalysis has been shown in several biological processes such as the RNA splicing, RNA processing and the replication of RNA genomes [76] . The Rz occur in nature and mainly cleaves the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids. There are several classes of ribozymes, of which only the hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have received a great deal of attention because of their smaller size. The hammerhead Rz has a 22-nt-long conserved catalytic core, that target RNA with NUX (N-any nucleotide and X-any nucleotide except guanosine) sequence, along with two flanked hybridizing arms (complimentary to target RNA) ( Figure 2 ) [77] . Several studies have utilized the hammerhead Rz for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. The hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes in different studies have been used to significantly disrupt and reduce viral replication hence effectively inhibiting pre-genomic RNA levels of infecting viruses. dextrose soluble siRNAs to SARS-CoV-infected cells inhibited replication of SARS-CoV effectively [73] . In another study, siRNAs specific for protein responsible for viral entry (HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein), showed a significant inhibition of viral replication in virus-infected cells [74] . Adenoviruses are also known to cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Several studies have utilized siRNAs against adenovirus to inhibit their replication.

Several studies have utilized the hammerhead Rz for catalytically cleaving the target RNA due to its high catalytic activity. The hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes in different studies have been used to significantly disrupt and reduce viral replication hence effectively inhibiting pre-genomic RNA levels of infecting viruses. The ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. The catalytic motif of the ribozyme then cleaves its target RNA into pieces, thus inhibiting gene expression. After cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle. The ribozyme binds to its target mRNA and makes an mRNA-ribozyme complex. The catalytic motif of the ribozyme then cleaves its target RNA into pieces, thus inhibiting gene expression. After cleaving the RNA target, the ribozyme becomes free again to enter into the next cycle.

The propensity for high mutation in RNA viruses lead to the emergence of drug resistant strains which is a major challenge in antiviral chemotherapy. To overcome the toxicity and resistance concerns, naturally occurring molecules such as the ribozymes in the host cells are being extensively explored as potential therapeutic agents.

Tang et al., in their study, showed the ribozyme mediated inhibition of influenza virus infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments [78] . They designed both the hammerhead and the hairpin ribozymes to cleave the viral RNA-segment 5 of influenza A virus and observed the effect of hammerhead Rz better than the hairpin Rz [78] . In another study by Motard et al., SOFA-HDV-Ribozymes were engineered as therapeutic agent to recognize conserved regions of the influenza virus sequences and to catalytically cleave the corresponding viral mRNA targets and disrupt viral replication [79] . Further characterization of the ribozyme's antiviral effect in cell culture and in mice supported the prophylactic potential of SOFA-HDV-Ribozyme combinations as influenza anti-infective and served as novel strategy for antivirals against genetically and highly variable respiratory viruses [79] . A study also showed the utilization of external guide sequences (EGS) and ribonuclease P (a type of ribozyme) to inhibit the influenza virus production in mouse cells [80] . In yet another study, the Influenza virus PB1 gene was targeted by Rz directed to cleave the PB1 mRNA [81] . The target cells were made to express the designed Rz and its effect on inhibition of influenza A virus strains A/Singapore/1/57 and A/WSN/33 production and subsequent virus-specific protein synthesis was evaluated. The study showed a significant 93.5% inhibition in virus reproduction with designed Rz as compared to control cells [81] . In another novel mechanistic study, authors designed the siRNA-chimeric-ribozyme constructs to inhibit influenza virus replication [52] . Both the designed siRNA and hammerhead Rz were directed to cleave the M1 RNA of influenza A virus. The chimeric construct demonstrated a >80% protection against the virus challenge; however, the selectively disabled mutant constructs were far less effective [52] . In another follow-up study, the same group showed that effect of several Rz designed to target multiple sites in the M1 mRNA of influenza virus [77] . The study demonstrated that Dz132 and Rz163 when used together gave an enhanced cleavage effect than when they were used individual or additive effect [77] . The study also showed that antisense molecules designed to hybridize to specific sequences upstream and downstream of the Rz163 gave significant cleavage effect than Rz163 alone [77] . The ribozymes have also been reportedly used to generate recombinant influenza viruses [82] . The study dealt with transfection of plasmids carrying the human RNA polymerase I promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequences in in vero cells in order to rescue influenza A viruses by reverse genetics [82] .

A study performed on SARS-coronavirus using a chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme showed the usefulness of Rz in inhibiting virus replication upto 60% [83] . The authors further showed that the chimeric construct targeting SARS-CoV significantly reduced the expression of SARS-CoV RNA in 3T3 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid, thus proving a feasible treatment option for SARS [83] .

A virus infection in any target cells begins with the step of successful entry followed by trafficking in the cytosol before the viral genome reaches its destination. During these events, specific viral proteins interact with several host proteins in order to initiate signaling required for the infection. One such study focused on the identification of the most optimal Rz target sites within the fusion gene of Adenovirus E1A-Associated 300 kDa Protein [84] and suggested that Rz mechanism can also be exploited for studying the functionality of host proteins required for viral infections [84] .

DNA was first isolated 150 years ago and identified by James Watson and Francis Crick 65 years ago. Initially, the only function attributed to DNA was to carry and pass genetic information from one generation to another. However, with advancements in science, DNA molecules got recognition for having a new role in the field of materials science [85] .

Deoxyribozymes, also known as DNAzymes or DNA enzymes, are synthetic catalytic single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid molecules that display precise substrate recognition and have the ability to cleave sequence-specific mRNA molecules with greater biological stability [86] . A Dz molecule has one central catalytic motif flanked by two arms. Both the arms (I and II) are designed complimentary to the target RNA molecule so that the designed Dz binds to it on a Watson-Crick basis ( Figure 3 ). Of the several types of DNAzymes known to catalyze functions like RNA ligation [87] , carbon-carbon bond formation [88] and the hydrolytic cleavage of DNA, the best characterized one is still the RNA-cleaving DNAzymes. DNAzymes have not been reported to occur naturally as DNA molecules are predominantly double stranded; however, Breaker and Joyce generated a DNAzyme de novo by an in vitro selection process in the year 1994. Further in vitro selection experiments generated two prototypes denoted as the ""10-23"" and the ""8-17"" RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes. The 10-23 Dz studied by several researchers, has been shown to cleave the target RNA between a purine and pyrimidine both under the in vivo and in vitro conditions. The 8-17 Dz also cleaves the RNA, however it is less popular because of its less established efficacy. The 8-17 Dz cleaves between A and G nucleotides and require a rG-dT wobble pair in the enzyme-substrate complex, located immediately after the cleavage site for its cleavage activity.

DNA-based drugs have notable advantages over currently available low molecular weight pharmaceuticals because of their specific recognition of molecular targets resulting in pinpoint action [89] . Several studies have demonstrated the effect of DNAzymes specifically targeting vital genes of influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV to inhibit their replication in cell line and mice models.

Toyoda et al. investigated the use of 10-23 Dzs targeting PB2 mRNA to inhibit virus replication as potential therapeutics against respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus [90] . Dzs, especially those with longer substrate-binding domains, were able to inhibit influenza virus 

DNA-based drugs have notable advantages over currently available low molecular weight pharmaceuticals because of their specific recognition of molecular targets resulting in pinpoint action [89] . Several studies have demonstrated the effect of DNAzymes specifically targeting vital genes of influenza virus, RSV, and SARS-CoV to inhibit their replication in cell line and mice models.

Toyoda et al. investigated the use of 10-23 Dzs targeting PB2 mRNA to inhibit virus replication as potential therapeutics against respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus [90] . Dzs, especially those with longer substrate-binding domains, were able to inhibit influenza virus replication in cells.

Modified anti-PB2 10-23 Dzs was similarly shown to inhibit influenza A virus. The most active analogues containing N3 -P5 phosphoramidate linkages reduced the level of influenza A virus replication by 99% but demonstrated no activity towards influenza B virus [91] . Likewise, catalytically inactive mutants showed 20-50% inhibition perhaps due to their antisense action.

Several novel Dz and hammerhead ribozymes (Rz) have been constructed to cleave the conserved domains of the influenza virus M1 RNA as an antiviral strategy to reduce the infectiousness of the virus. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study showed that both Dz and Rz can inhibit replication of the virus individually with a substantial decrease (54%) in virus replication when used simultaneously. The authors concluded that combining catalytic Dz and Rz with antisense molecules lead to a more efficient gene suppression and complete inhibition of virus replication in host cells [77] . Various Dz have also been studied for activity against influenza B virus targeting the BM2 ion channel protein. BM2 has a highly conserved sequence and is crucial during the uncoating process of the influenza virus. One of the Dz (Dz209) demonstrated significant intracellular reduction of BM2 gene expression in transient-expression system and provided protection against influenza B virus challenge in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [92] . In a follow-up study from same group, the Dz114, among several others, exhibited 70% inhibition of influenza A virus M2 gene expression as shown by the PCR and Western blot analysis. The activity of the designed Dz was further shown to be dependent on the Mg (2+) in a dose-dependent (10-50 mM) manner [93] .

RSV has also been targeted using DNAzymes. A series of Dzs were designed and synthesized to silence RSV N, M2 and F genes. One Dz (DZn1133) cleaved the RSV RNA in vitro, inhibited the transcription and expression of F viral gene, reduced the RSV production by about 7 logs and protected more than 90% of RSV-infected Hep-2 cells from the cytopathic effect when used at the concentration of 8 µM. Additionally, 10 wild RSV strains (including both subgroups A and B) isolated from patients showed significant suppression by DZn1133 with higher anti-RSV activity than that for ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) or an antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) complementary to the same region of the N RNA [94] . Treatment with Dzn1133 reduced viral plaque formation in the lungs of RSV-infected BALB/c mice. Additionally, it was observed that the designed Dz significantly reduced the viral mRNA expression, alleviated the airway inflammation, and reduced the leukocyte counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of RSV-infected mice. The DZ1133 showed a dose-dependent (0.2-0.8mg) antiviral effect and was observed to be more efficient than the antisense oligonucleotide mediated inhibition of gene expression even though levels of cytokines such as the TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-10 induced by the RSV infection were unaffected. The overall results demonstrated that DZ1133 can be used as a potential therapeutic agent against infections with both subgroups A and B of RSV in vivo [95] .

SARS-CoV has also been targeted using Dz molecules. The use of a Dz to target the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of a highly conserved fragment in the SARS-CoV genome to suppress viral replication has been reported. A study showed the efficacy of a mono-DNA enzyme (Dz-104) possessing the 10-23 catalytic motif, both in vitro and in cell culture experiments. The Dz-104 showed an in vitro cleavage of the SARS-CoV RNA substrate and reduced the expression of the SARS-CoV 5 UTR-eGFP fusion RNA in the mammalian cells. The results provide a basis for the potential therapeutic usage of DNA enzymes to combat SARS infection [96] .

Antisense oligonucleotides are small synthetic pieces of single-stranded DNA that are normally 15-30 nucleotides in length. ASOs specifically bind to complementary DNA/RNA sequences by Watson-Crick hybridization and once bound to the target RNA, inhibit the translational processes either by inducing cleavage mechanisms or by inhibiting mRNA maturation [97] . The use of ASOs was first reported by Zamecnik and Stephenson in 1978 as a potential antiviral therapeutics. They utilized a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide composed of 13 nucleotides (a 13-mer) that was designed to block Rous sarcoma virus replication [98, 99] . Since then, ASOs ability to selectively inhibit gene expression has generated noteworthy enthusiasm in the scientific and medical community because of its specificity and the breadth of its potential applications as therapeutic agents. An extensive range of oligonucleotide analogs has become available over the past decade and this lead to target validation and development of ASO-based antiviral agents whose efficacy have been reported against various virus types, both in vitro as well as in vivo [100] . For ASOs to be used empirically, modifications of DNAs or RNAs were needed to retain hybridization capacity at the same time increasing stability. Major alterations have been introduced in the phosphodiester bond, the sugar ring, and the backbone to result in three generations of nucleic acid analogs for the synthesis of ASO oligomers. ASO-based antiviral agents are specifically designed to block the translational processes either by (i) ribonuclease H (RNAse H) or RNase P mediated cleavage of mRNA or (ii) by sterically (non-bonding) blocking enzymes that are involved in the target gene translation [97] .

Antisense oligonucleotides have been studied extensively against several respiratory viruses with promising results.

The earliest studies using oligonucleotide ('oligo') to inhibit synthesis of virus-specific proteins, including influenza, in MDCK cells were reported in the 1990s. Researchers observed that the modified oligos could effectively suppress the influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus production [101] . Since then several other ASOs have been synthesized and studied for efficacy against influenza. Ge et al. showed that siRNAs specifically designed to target the conserved regions of the viral genome can potently inhibit influenza virus production in cell lines (Vero, MDCK) as well as embryonated chicken eggs [48] . Wu et al. showed that in vivo treatment with three doses of RNA oligonucleotides conferred significant protection to the infected chickens from H5N1 virus-induced mortality at a rate of up to 87.5%. The authors used mixed RNA oligonucleotides targeting the NS1 gene to show a significant reduction in the plaque-forming unit (PFU) and viral RNA levels in the lung tissues of the infected animals by plaque assay and real-time PCR analysis. Their study demonstrated that RNA oligonucleotides targeting at the viral NS1 gene could potently inhibit highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus reproduction and thus, could potentially be used as prophylaxis and therapy for H5N1 influenza virus infection in humans [102] . In another study, Gabriel et al. used three peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs), to selectively target the translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3 -terminal region of NP viral RNA, to prevent virus replication in MDCK cells. The study further utilized the primer extension assays to show that treatment with any of the effective PPMO markedly reduced the levels of mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA [103] . Another study by Duan et al. used a novel antisense oligonucleotide (IV-AS) specifically designed against the 5 -terminal conserved sequence found in all the eight viral RNA segments of influenza A virus. They monitored the activity of IV-AS both in vitro in the MDCK cells and in vivo using a mouse model. IV-AS was administered intranasally to the H5N1-infected mice once daily for 6 days starting 6 h post-infection. IV-AS, at 50% effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 2.2 to 4.4 µM, inhibited influenza A virus induced cytopathic effects in MDCK cells. IV-AS was also effective against H5N1 virus in preventing death, reducing weight loss, reducing lung consolidation and decreasing the lung virus titers [104] . Lupfer et al. showed that antisense-PPMOs, delivered through the intranasal route, were able to inhibit the replication of equine influenza A virus A/Eq/Miami/1/63 (H3N8) in mice by over 95% compared to the controls [105] . In another study, a group of authors designed antisense oligonucleotides against the common 3 NCR of segments of the IAV genome to inhibit its replication [106] . The AS molecules demonstrated a drastic reduction in the cytopathic effect caused to the 3 end of its coding region (nucleotides 2279-2293), proved noticeably inhibitory. Similar to other related studies, the antiviral activity of 5-15b was also observed to be dose-and time-dependent; however, it was independent of the cell substrate and multiplicity of infection used in the study [107] . In another follow-up study, Giannecchini et al. investigated whether analogous inhibitory S-ONs targeting PB1 and PA gene segments could be identified and if virus can develop resistance to S-ONs. The authors observed that the 20-mer S-ONs reproducing the 5 ends of PB1 and PA gene segments exerted a dominant antiviral activity against several influenza A virus subtypes in MDCK cells. Their findings suggest that the packaging signal at the 5 end of the PB2 vRNA can be a potential therapeutic target for the design of novel anti-influenza compounds. Also, antivirals against this region could be beneficial owing to less changes of mutation in these viral genes [108] .

Recently RSV has also been targeted by several designed ASO molecules. Jairath et al., in their study investigated the use of oligodeoxyribonucleotides to inhibit RSV replication in cell culture. Human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells were infected with RSV strain A2 and treated with the designed oligonucleotides. A 0.5-1 µM 50% effective concentration (EC50) values were obtained for the designed antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the start of the viral NS2 gene. The ELISA and PT-PCR analyses showed that all the oligonucleotides inhibited virus antigen production and demonstrated sequence specific depletion of the genomic RNA target. The target RNA was observed to be cleaved at the specific antisense oligonucleotide binding site. The results suggest that antisense oligonucleotides could have therapeutic value against RSV infections [110] . PPMOs have the ability to readily enter cells and interfere with viral protein expression through steric hindrance of the complementary RNA. Lai et al. designed two antisense PPMOs to specifically target the 5 -terminal region and translation start-site region of RSV L mRNA [111] . Both PPMOs demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when tested for anti-RSV activity in two human-airway cell lines. One PPMO (AUG-2), reduced the viral titers by >2.0 log10. Intranasal administration of AUG-2 in BALB/c mice before the RSV infection showed a reduction in viral titer of 1.2 log10 in lung tissue at day 5 post-infection, and further reduced pulmonary inflammation at day 7 post-infection. The overall results show that PPMO has a potent anti-RSV activity and the potential to be a therapeutic regimen against RSV infections [111] .

Neuman et al. designed specific PPMOs against specific sequences in the SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) genome [112] . The PPMOs were analyzed for their capability to inhibit infectious virus production and were further investigated to determine the function of conserved vRNA motifs and their secondary structures. Several virus specific PPMOs along with a random-sequence control PPMO were designed that showed low inhibitory activity against SARS-CoA. The virus-targeted PPMOs further reduced the cytopathology due to viral infection and reduced cell-to-cell spread because of reduction in viral replication. The active PPMO were found to be most effective when administered any time prior to the peak viral synthesis and exerted a sustained antiviral effect in the culture medium. The study demonstrated the antiviral effects in vitro for the PPMO designed complementary to the AUG translation start site region of a murine coronavirus replicase [112] and suggested a therapeutic potential of ASOs against coronavirus infection [113] . In another study, Ahn et al. evaluated the antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) that is utilized by eukaryotic RNA viruses [114] . Cells transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon, treated with the PNA (50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 µM) fused to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), showed a significant suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV [114] .

Aptamers are 20-90 nucleotides long, synthetic single strand nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA). They are designed to bind to various organic or nonorganic molecules-ranging from single atoms to a wide range of proteins (Figure 4 ). Aptamers are highly specific to target molecule and are generated by the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method [115] . For the last 20 years, aptamers have been used as a diagnostic tool for the treatment of viral diseases.

Owing to pandemic nature of the disease and constant mutation in virus, identification of different subtypes becomes essential. In most cases antibodies are used to distinguish influenza A and B but most successful probes to distinguish different subtypes are aptamers. That is why aptamers to most common subunits of the virus are being used to develop sensors for influenza detection. Hemagglutinin (HA), is influenza viral surface glycoprotein responsible for fusion of virus with the host cell. In case of influenza, at least 18 different HA antigens has been identified which are not only responsible for diagnosis but identification of different influenza types and subtypes. Since 2004, more than 40 DNA and RNA aptamers against recombinant hemagglutinins (H1, H3, H5, H9, and HA from influenza virus B) and to whole viruses (H5N1) [116] have been constructed. Misono and Kumar used SPR-based SELEX to design and select an RNA aptamer and showed its activity against HA of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) [117] . Gopinath et al. constructed two targeted RNA aptamers, P30-10-16 and A-20, used to differentiate influenza type A from type B and closely related strains of the influenza subtypes [118, 119] . RNA aptamer P30-10-16, was found to be 15 times more specific to H3N2 of influenza A virus than to any conventional anti-HA monoclonal antibody [119] . Subsequently, several aptamers were constructed to detect influenza virus type A (H1N1 and H3N2) , as well as avian influenza virus, H5N1 [120, 121] . These aptamers can prove to be helpful in diagnosing and distinguishing all the dangerous influenza strains with potentially high epidemiological risk. In 2013, Wang and Li generated biosensor based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique where they modified DNA aptamer by cross linking it to quartz particles to detect avian influenza virus more specifically [120] . Similarly, Bai et al. 2012 also suggested usage of an SPR aptasensor directed against avian influenza H5N1 [122] . Later on, the impedance-based aptasensor with microfluidics chips, with a lower detection limit than the SPR-based aptasensor and the same sensitivity as the QCM aptasensor, were used to detect H5N1 avian influenza virus [123] . Recently, Nguyen et al. used a SPR based sandwich type sensor to detect H5Nx viruses [124] . The sensitivity of this dual aptamer-based sensor increased many folds when the secondary aptamer was conjugated with gold nanoparticles. These chemical modifications of aptamers reduce selection time and increase their biostability in vivo. The early diagnosis and identification of subtypes, help target viral strains specifically and rationally.

The sensitivity of this dual aptamer-based sensor increased many folds when the secondary aptamer was conjugated with gold nanoparticles.

These chemical modifications of aptamers reduce selection time and increase their biostability in vivo. The early diagnosis and identification of subtypes, help target viral strains specifically and rationally.

Aptamers have been developed against influenza for therapeutics purposes. Many of these aptamers developed against HA could prevent the entry of the virus to the cells by blocking hemagglutinin activity which could be measured in vitro using hemagglutination inhibition assay. The usage of DNA aptamer A22 showed reduction of 95% of viral infection when administered concomitantly with the viral infection in the mice model. A22 was less effective when it was given prior to the infection [125] . In 2014, Musafia et al. used the modified A22 which had 10-15 times more potent antiviral activity in animal models than A22 aptamer. Many aptamers targeting other subunits important for viral replication and progression have also been studied [126] . Woo et al. successfully studied a DNA aptamer against NS1 subunit. This particular aptamer maintained the cell viability and induced IFN-β production while inhibiting the viral replication [127] . Later on, aptamers against subunits of polymerase complex of influenza virus, PA, PB1, and PB2 were also studied; and finally, the aptamers with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) around 10 nM was identified that exhibited cross-protection against infections of H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 influenza viruses [128] .

Few aptamers targeting host cell factors important for viral replication have also been studied. ApPABP7 and ApPABP11 aptamers which inhibit viral protein-host translation factor interactions have been useful against influenza [129] . Similarly use of a specific RIG-I aptamer efficiently blocks the replication of influenza and other viruses in infected cells through IFNα/β immune responses [130, 131] .

In case of yet another respiratory virus SARS, nucleocapsid (N) protein, one of the most abundant proteins, is the target choice for developing aptamers. Ahn et al. have developed a nanoarray aptamer chip with the RNA aptamer which can proficiently detect SARS nucleocapsid protein at a concentration as low as 2 pg/mL [132] . Likewise, ssDNA aptamer proficiently detects N protein by Western blot [133] . RNA aptamer ES15 used to target nsP10 (nonstructural protein 10) by Jang et al. inhibited viral enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner (with IC50 = 1.2 nM) [134] . Yet another study showed that DNA aptamers against the non-structural nsp13 protein, inhibiting helicase activity of nsp13 protein required for SARS viral replication [135] .

A recent study on RSV demonstrated that aptamers can be selected based on the rationally designed SELEX protocol against whole virus and that the specific aptamers can potentially be utilized for detecting the respiratory syncytial virus [136] .

RNA interference mediated by tools like shRNA, ribozymes, and DNAzymes has emerged as an important technology not only to study gene functions but also for therapeutic purpose to manage viral infections and restrict the growth of cancerous cells. The biggest hurdle in the use of these tools is the in vivo delivery to target cells. Major challenges in in vivo delivery of the nucleic acids include their immunogenicity, enzymatic digestion in body fluids, phagocytosis by the immune cells, and renal clearance. Moreover, highly charged nature of nucleic acids does not allow them to cross the cell membrane by free diffusion. Intracellular challenges to the delivery of these molecules include endosomal and lysosomal escape in the cell cytoplasm. Several strategies have been developed for efficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acids which include use of both viral as well as non-viral vectors as the delivery vehicles.

With reference to respiratory viruses, numerous studies have been reported for non-viral vector mediated in vivo delivery of siRNA and ribozymes targeting the respiratory virus genome. Cationic systems like liposomes and polymers have been successfully used for systemic administration of siRNA molecules. Liposomal vectors being positively charged can efficiently form a complex with negatively charged effector nucleic acids on one side and interact with negatively charged cell membrane on the other side. The size of the vector also needs to be kept below 100 nm to prevent renal clearance after systemic administration. A polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), could be used as a carrier of shRNA targeted to mRNA encoding PA, PB1, and PB2 protein of influenza A virus. It was observed that shRNAs cloned in pSilencer2.1-U6 puro plasmid vector had a prophylactic effect on the mice infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) when delivered as shRNA-jetPEI complex through intra-tracheal route. However, these complexes could not show any therapeutic efficacy [137] . Another study was done on siRNA designed against gene encoding phosphoprotein of RSV. It was shown that siRNA delivered through intranasal route prior to infection, either naked or in complex with transfection reagent viz. TransIT-TKO reagent, could significantly reduce the viral titer and disease outcome in mice. However, again the effect of siRNA was very low when delivered after virus infection [63] . Alnylam Pharmaceuticals translated the results of study done by Bitko et al. into human trials to evaluate the antiviral activity of the siRNA under the name ALN-RSV01 which has crossed the Phase 2a clinical trial and found to be safe when delivered to healthy human individuals as nasal spray (aerosols) [65] . There are several other reports showing the efficacy of intranasal administration of siRNA in complex with transfection reagents to reduce viral titer in lungs of infected mice and to relieve the symptoms [50, 138] . However, administration of siRNA complexed with polyethyleneimine or other transfection reagent like lipofectamine through intravenous route has also been shown to exert inhibitory effect on the virus replication in lungs of treated mice leading to more than 30% inhibition in the lung virus titer [49, 53, 139, 140] . In the study done by Tompkins et al., the direct intravenous injection of siRNA-oligofectamine in PBS aided the effect of intranasal inoculation of the siRNA complex (targeted to nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase gene) thus reducing the pathogenicity of highly virulent influenza A virus strains [50] . Though PEI and other transfection reagents have been shown as effective carrier of RNAi tools in mice model, these are not feasible for clinical use because of their proinflammatory effect. Li et al. demonstrated that siRNA complexed with carriers like D5W solution and Infasurf solution is safe for clinical use. Intra-tracheal administration of siRNA-D5W solution complex targeted to spike coding gene and NSP12 region of SARS coronavirus (SCV) genome showed efficient inhibition of SCV replication and suppression of SARS like symptoms in monkey model [32] .

Apart from the above-mentioned polymer or lipid-based delivery of shRNA, therapeutic RNA molecules can also be delivered through intranasal route in complex with chitosan nanoparticles. In a study done with chitosan nanoparticles, it was shown that intranasal inoculation of chitosan complexed with plasmid encoding shRNA targeted to NS1 gene of RSV could reduce RSV infection and lung pathology in rat model. The complex was also successful in modulating the immune response to RSV infection [141] .

The role of ribozymes as therapeutic tool was shown by Motard et al. who designed SOFA-HDV-Rzs targeted to all the mRNA except that of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of influenza A virus. The ribozymes targeted to conserved regions of mRNA corresponding to nucleoprotein and non-structural gene of influenza A virus were found to inhibit virus replication in the lungs of treated mice when delivered intra-nasally in complex with in vivo-jetPEITM. Although the extent of reduction in viral titer in the lungs of infected mice was low, the ribozymes could significantly affect the clinical outcomes of the infected mice [79] . In the same year, another study revealed an approach to manage respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection using ribozymes. The ribozyme was designed against the L gene mRNA of RSV and expressed via an inducible RSV minigenome replicon system which generated pseudovirus particles (defective RSV particles) expressing therapeutic ribozymes. The minigenome system could be induced by actual RSV infection and had the potential to inhibit virus replication when delivered intra-nasally via pseudovirus particles as delivery vehicles [142] .

Viral vectors for delivery of RNAi tools for respiratory viruses are relatively less discussed. Baculovirus is one such vector. It is an insect virus vector known for its safety and high packaging capacity. The vector is considered safe as the recombinant baculovirus is replication incompetent in mammalian cell and does not produce immunogenic viral proteins. It is reported that recombinant baculovirus vector could exhibit transient but effective expression of shRNA targeted to influenza A and B virus under in vitro condition. The duration of expression could be increased by insertion of Epstein-Barr virus sequences into the vector [143] . The use of this vector for in vivo expression of RNAi tools needs to be examined.

Although RNAi has received significant attention in the basic and applied research related to biological systems, the RNAi associated immune stimulation may pose hurdle in clinical applications. The possibility of innate immune response induced by siRNAs/shRNAs or its delivery vehicles is yet another obstacle that needs to be addressed very carefully [144] [145] [146] . Recent studies have shown that advanced chemically modified RNAi molecules can be designed to trigger less immune response. Furthermore, the potential benefits of immunostimulatory siRNAs can be beneficial in case of viral infections and antagonistic cancers (reviewed in [147] ). In spite of associated innate immune responses, the nucleic acid-based strategies still hold a lot of importance and most of them are currently undergoing various phase of clinical trial. They are not only shown to be effective against viruses, but they have also been used to target non-viral diseases ( Table 1) . 

Respiratory viruses have been a global concern for decades and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both children and adults. Some of these viruses show seasonality in pattern of outbreaks [150] and can be managed if proper precautions and preventive measures are initiated in time. The major ones, influenza and RSV, are the leading causes of respiratory disease and a continuous surveillance system is required to understand their changing pattern year after year. They both have coinciding seasonality which aggravates the scenario. Although several studies have focused on techniques that can help diagnose these viral infections in a short time [35, [151] [152] [153] , and symptomatic treatments are available, prevention is still better than cure. Vaccination is considered the most effective tool; however, the need for annual vaccine formulation against highly mutating influenza viruses is a reason to continuously try to develop novel strategies [154] to combat frequent epidemics. RSV does not have a successful vaccine yet [61] , and only a few vaccine candidates are in clinical trials [155] .

Nucleic acid-based therapeutics gained popularity because of its ability to target genes and inhibit translation. Strategies like antisense technology, ribozymes, DNAzymes as well as the RNAi-based therapeutics have greatly improved in the recent years. New studies have also developed improved strategies for overcoming the issues relating to instability by utilizing various types of modifications such as phosphorothioate (PS) DNA or 2-O-methyl-RNA (OMe) which proved to be more stable than normal DNA/RNA oligonucleotides. Several pathogens, including viruses, have been targeted utilizing one of these nucleic acid based silencing strategies. Numerous studies conducted in experimental animal models as well as in cell culture systems have evaluated the efficiency and efficacy of these molecules in post-transcriptional silencing of crucial viral genes to obstruct protein translation and inhibit viral replication. Some of these strategies have already made their place in clinical trials.

The efficacy of the nucleic acid-based molecules is dependent on their expression, stability, and accessibility to the target sites. If properly designed and modified, all these nucleic acids may have significant inhibitory effect on relevant target but combination of more than one type of therapeutic can always show synergistic effect against the virus propagation in host cells.

Although the discussed therapeutic nucleic acids are highly specific for their target and are optimized for nil off-target effect, hence, their side effects including effect on cellular metabolism is expected to be negligible. The risk factor associated with these molecules can be their delivery vehicles especially the viral vectors but if appropriately chosen, the related risk can be minimized.

The available literatures on such strategies show tremendous potential; however, the development of such molecules is not very simple and requires extensive optimizations in respect of their stability and modes of delivery. Any new discovery of antiviral compounds brings with it associated challenges; still, the effort of such discoveries is essential and potentially offers more effective and better tools to manage viral infections.

Therapeutic Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies,"Researchers have sought therapeutic applications for monoclonal antibodies since their development in 1975. However, murine-derived monoclonal antibodies may cause an immunogenic response in human patients, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have been developed that are less likely to provoke an immune reaction in human patients than are murine-derived antibodies. Antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies, and antibodies produced through the use of phage display systems and genetically modified plants and animals may aid researchers in developing new uses for monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of disease. Monoclonal antibodies may have a number of promising potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancer, poisoning, septicemia, substance abuse, viral infections, and other diseases.","I n 1975, Kohler and Milstein revolutionized the field of immunology by developing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Since that time, many MAbs have been developed for use in diagnostic procedures and in immunotherapy. Ever since it was observed that the therapeutic use of heterologous MAbs elicited immunogenic responses in humans, significant research efforts have been devoted toward creating chimeric and humanized antibodies for use in human patients. Major achievements have been in the production of MAbs in transgenic plants and animals. The use of phage display libraries has created customized antibodies with defined affinity and specificity. This review describes how rodent, chimeric, and humanized antibodies have each been used, with varying degrees of success to treat cancer, septicemia, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. We also describe here recent applications of antibody engineering, such as the use of bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments in immunotherapy.

Von Behring and Kitasato discovered in 1890 that the serum of vaccinated persons contained certain substances, which they termed ""antibodies."" In 1895, they treated diphtheria with an antiserum raised against the toxin. On the basis of research on tetanus toxin and trypanosome parasites, Ehrlich proposed in 1900 the ""side-chain theory"" of antibody formation, which hypothesized that physiologically active substances, including toxins, attach to cell surface receptors that are produced in response to toxin-cell interactions and then ejected from the cells into the bloodstream, leading to circulating antibodies. 1, 2 Not until the 1950s, however, did scientists' understanding of antibodies become sufficient to lay the foundation for the development of MAbs. Jerne 3 postulated in 1955 a theory of natural selection for antibody formation. Animals vaccinated with an antigen were expected to produce several distinct antibodies against several epitopes of the antigen. Frank Macfarlane Burnet subsequently refined and expanded Jerne's theory. 4 Burnet's ""clonal selection theory,"" as it is generally known, postulates that cells specific for synthesizing 1 type of antibody are spontaneously generated due to random somatic mutations during the maturation of the immune system and that these cells proliferate when exposed to an antigen. At about the same time, Porter isolated fragment antigen binding (Fab) and fragment crystalline (Fc) from proteolytically cleaved rabbit ␥-globulin. 5 Until the 1960s, antibody-producing cells were difficult to maintain in culture, because they died after a few days. In addition, only polyclonal antibodies could be obtained. In 1964, Littlefield 6 developed a way to isolate hybrid cells from 2 parent cell lines using the hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymi-dine (HAT) selection media. In 1975, Khler and Milstein 7 provided the most outstanding proof of the clonal selection theory from results of heterokaryons-cell hybrids formed by the fusion of normal and malignant cells. Twenty-five years after Kohler and Milstein produced the first monoclonal antibodies, dramatic progress has been made in using antibodies for diagnostic purposes, but the uses of MAbs to treat disease have-until recently-remained somewhat limited. 8, 9 However, as this review indicates, the potential of MAbs to aid in the treatment of a wide range of diseases is now beginning to be realized.

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins composed of peptides called heavy and light chains, the ends of which vary from antibody to antibody. Each combination of heavy and light chains binds to a particular antigenic site. These glycoprotein chains are folded into domains of about 110 amino acids that become twisted into the immunoglobulin (Ig) fold and are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Structurally, each Ig molecule consists of 2 50-kD heavy chains and 2 25-kd light chains, linked by disulfide bonds.

Human immunoglobulins are divided into 5 classes or isotypes based on the amino acid composition of their heavy chains: ␣, ␦, ⑀, ␥, and , denoted IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively. There are 2 kinds of light chains, (k) and (l), which are common to all 5 classes. Four subclasses of IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and 2 subclasses of IgA (IgA1 and IgA2) exist, each with a distinct function. Secretory IgA exists in dimeric form held together by a J chain and is associated with a secretory component that helps it pass through the cell membrane. 10, 11 Each chain has a constant domain to bind host effector molecule and a variable domain to bind to the target antigen. Light chains have 1 variable (V L ) and 1 constant domain (C L ), whereas heavy chains have 1 variable (V H ) and either 3 (␣, ␦, and ␥ chains) or 4 constant domains (⑀ and heavy chains) depending upon the isotype class. Each variable domain contains 3 regions known as ""hypervariable loops,"" also known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), that identify the antigen. The other amino acids in the variable (Fv) domain are known as framework residues and act as a scaffold to support the loops. The V L and the V H , the C H 1 and the C L , and the 2 C H 3 domains are paired; the 2 C H 2 domains have carbohydrate side chains attached to them and are not paired. The folded constant domains may be homologous among different species, allowing hybrid domains (eg, mouse-human) to be produced. The variable domain confers specificity and affinity. The CDR amino acid sequences are extremely variable and play a large role in interac-tion with the targeted antigen. The chain type, region, and distance from the amino terminus characterize the domains. Thus, C H 2 domain refers to the second constant domain of the heavy chain.

Upon digestion with papain, the antibody molecule is cleaved on the amino-terminal side of the disulfide bridges into 2 identical Fabs and an Fc fragment, whereas pepsin cleaves the antibody on the carboxy-terminal side of the disulfide bridges into 1 F(ab') 2 fragment containing both the arms of the antibody, and many small pieces of the Fc fragment. Currently, the following are available: whole antibodies, enzymatically produced 50-kd Fab fragments, engineered 25-kd single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies consisting of the V H and V L connected by a flexible peptide linker, diabodies (noncovalent dimers of scFv), minibodies (scFv-C H 3 dimers), and heavy chain IgGs found in species of the Camelidae family, which are devoid of light chains and are referred to as V HH .

The first MAb described by Kohler and Milstein was created by the fusion of murine myeloma cells with murine-antibody-secreting lymphocytes. 7, 8 Myeloma cells are immortalized B lymphocytes capable of secreting homogeneous antibodies. The immortal myeloma cell lacks the enzyme hypoxanthine guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) and is sensitive to the HAT media. However, a hybrid cell known as a hybridoma, generated by the fusion of myeloma cell and an antibody-producing B cell, can survive in the HAT media. The spleen B lymphocytes contribute the HGPRT gene to the hybrid cell and, hence, unfused myeloma cells and spleen cells die in the HAT media.

The conventional method of generating MAbs is the hybridoma technology in which spleen cells from immunized mice are fused with murine myeloma cells. Whereas the myeloma cell imparts immortality to the hybridoma allowing cells to be cultivated indefinitely, the immune spleen B-cell confers antigen specificity. Because each hybridoma is derived from a single cell, the cells within a hybridoma cell line are identical and make the same antibody molecule with same antigen-binding site and isotype, hence it is called a MAb. Among several excellent reviews that detail MAb production with hybridomas is a recent review by Dean and Shepherd. 12 Initial attempts to bypass the mouse to make human MAbs involved fusion of human immune spleen lymphocytes with nonsecreting human myeloma partners to obtain hybrid cells that continually secrete a specific antibody. However, poor fusion of human myelomas, unsatisfactory performance of the hybrid cells, and the difficulty in accessing immune lymphocytes have prevented success. Although heteromyelomas-which are fusions of hu-man and mouse myelomas-work better, these hybrids are usually unstable. Attempts to use mouse myeloma cells to create hybrids and derive human MAbs led to the loss of human chromosomes and the inability to make human Igs. 13 Unfortunately, in vitro immunization is limited by its inability to produce a secondary response and by the absence of the affinity maturation process that occurs in vivo. 13 Affinity maturation process is a complex phenomenon, a consequence of intense Bcell proliferation, somatic hypermutation of Ig variable domain genes, and selection for B cells with high-affinity antigen binding, all occurring in the specialized microenvironment of the germinal center within the lymphoid tissue. Thus, the search for an ideal fusion partner for generating human MAbs has been difficult, which is why the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) technique for immortalization of B lymphocytes is preferred. But immortalized B cells do not always replicate exactly the in vivo antibody response, because the tissues from which these cells were selected and the manipulations to which they are subjected to in the laboratory may alter the antibody specificity. 14, 15 Protocols for the preparation of EBV virus, B cells, and cell fusion have been described elsewhere. 14, 16, 17 Methods used for large-scale production of MAbs may include the generation of ascites tumors in mice or in vitro mammalian cell culture fermentation by using bioreactors and continuous perfusion culture systems. 18, 19 The key issues in scale-up productions are the growth media, fermenter size, fermentation time, and purification procedures. 19 Purification or downstream processing is accomplished by chromatography, fragmentation, conjugation with chelating agents, ultrafiltration, and controlled precipitation. 18

A more recent technique for producing antibodylike molecules uses what is known as the Phage Display Library. It involves the construction of V H and V L gene libraries and their expression on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage. Developed in the 1990s, the phage display method requires repeated ""panning"" or screening of different antibodies based on their affinity for a specific antigen. Antibody genes are linked to bacteriophage coat protein genes and the bacteriophages with the fusion genes are used to infect bacteria to create the phage display library. The resulting bacteriophages express the fusion proteins and display them on their surface, and the phage display library comprises recombinant phages, each displaying a different antigenbinding site on its surface. The phage expressing an antigen-binding domain specific for a particular antigen can be detected and isolated by binding to the surface coated with that antigen. Libraries of V H and V L genes may be generated from nonimmunized donors, immunized donors who have an immune response against a particular antigen or from a synthetic library consisting of antibody fragments. 20, 21 One promising way to increase antibody yield or develop new antibodies may be by using genetically altered animals and plants. Abgenix, a company in Fremont, CA, has developed the transgenic ""Xeno-Mouse,"" in which the mouse antibody-producing genes have been inactivated and functionally replaced by approximately 90% of the human Ig gene loci in germline configuration, coding for the heavy and light chains. 22, 23 Upon immunization with any specific human or nonhuman antigens, the ""Xeno-Mouse"" generates MAbs, which are fully human Igs, with high affinities and antigen-binding specificities. ""XenoMouse"" strains producing specifically IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotypes have also been created to generate panels of diverse and highly specific MAbs.

Kirin Brewery Company, Japan, has developed another transgenic mouse known as the ""Trans-Chromo"" mouse. The endogenous IgH and IgG loci of the ""Trans-Chromo"" mouse were inactivated, but it harbors 2 individual human chromosome fragments, derived from human chromosomes 2 and 14, that contain whole human Ig light-and heavy-chain loci, respectively. 24 These mice are capable of producing every subtype of fully human Ig, including IgA and IgM. In these transgenic mouse models, human antibodies with high affinity to an immunized antigen are naturally selected by the murine immune system via an affinity maturation process, and thereby show increased diversity of the MAbs.

Transgenic mice may be a suitable alternative to chimeric or humanized antibody production or the use of phage display systems to create less immunogenic or novel antibodies. 25 For instance, transgenic mice that express MAbs to coronavirus in their milk have been developed. 26, 27 Because ruminant animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep, produce relatively large amounts of milk, genetically-modified members of these species could also be used to produce large quantities of therapeutic proteins, including MAbs. 28 Plants may be a potential source of recombinant proteins, including MAbs. 29 -31 Plant virus vectors, such as the tobacco mosaic virus, may be used to make MAbs. Transgenic tobacco plants may also be used for large-scale production of recombinant IgA, which is used in passive mucosal immunotherapy. 30, 31 This MAb could be added to toothpaste to effectively protect against bacteria that cause tooth decay. 31, 32 Recombinant antigens obtained from plants may also have therapeutic applications. For instance, attempts to immunize mice with Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin B produced in transgenic tobacco and potato plants have proved promising. 33

Hepatitis B viral surface protein produced in transgenic tobacco plants has been shown to be immunogenic in mice. 32 The genes coding for murine malignant B-cell specific markers are inserted into tobacco mosaic virus to cultivate an immunogenic protein in tobacco plants that may eventually be used in developing a vaccine against non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 34, 35 Other immunotherapeutic proteins under development include Norwalk virus capsid proteins produced in tobacco and potatoes, cholera toxin and CT-B produced in potatoes, hepatitis B antigen produced in tobacco, anti-human IgG used to detect nonagglutinating antibodies produced in alfalfa, and humanized anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 grown in soybeans. 36 -39 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers antibodies to be ""biopharmaceuticals""; as such, MAb applications are regulated by the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 40, 41 The FDA has created a ""Points to Consider"" document advising manufacturers of factors to consider in the production and testing of MAbs intended for human use and identified information that should appear in Investigational New Drug or biologics license applications. 40 The ""Points to Consider"" document serves to ""indicate the agency's current thinking on MAb products for human use."" 40 The agency's recommendations are aimed at protecting human health because viruses and cellular DNA from antibody-producing cells with malignant phenotypes may be integrated into host cells after transformation. Accordingly, among the Points to Consider are several steps-such as taking care to ensure purity of immunoconjugates and demonstrating the ability of any purification scheme to remove adventitious agents-designed to prevent contamination of the final product by human pathogens. 40 Manufacturers must also adhere to animal care standards and detail steps to prevent contamination of cell culture.

The Points to Consider document includes a list of normal human tissues used in cross-reactivity testing, tests for murine viruses, and organs to be considered in dosimetry estimates. The FDA recognizes that because of species differences, animal models expressing the antigen of interest or cross-reactive epitopes are not always available.

The agency has also published a guidance entitled S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Derived Pharmaceuticals based on International Conference of Harmonization technical requirements. 41 Before beginning phase 1 clinical studiesconducted to assess the safety of the drug and its mechanism of action-the FDA recommends that researchers conduct in vivo and in vitro testing of the MAb to assess cross-reactivity with human tissues or non-target-tissue binding. Preclinical safety testing aims to evaluate the immunogenicity, crossreactivity, stability and effector functions of MAbs. The metabolism, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity of the product should also be evaluated. 41 Guidance has also been published for MAbs used as reagents in drug manufacturing. 42 The guidance emphasizes biological safety, performance characteristics of the reagent, and potential presence of residual amounts of the reagent in the final product.

The FDA general principles for testing and manufacturing are broadly applicable to many classes of antibodies, including those produced by phage display systems or transgenic plants and animals. Depending on the expression system being used, other FDA guidance documents, such as CBER's Points to

Produce Biologicals should also be referenced. [43] [44] [45] Humanizing Monoclonal Antibodies Rodent MAbs with excellent affinities and specificities have been generated using conventional hybridoma technology, but their use in clinical medicine is limited due to the immune responses they elicit in humans. For instance, the human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response can compromise the clinical effectiveness of murine MAbs. Although HAMA responses are directed against the murine constant regions, which represent the major antigenic features of the mouse Ig, significant responses are also directed toward the murine variable regions. As a result, patients may mount an immune response against the injected murine antibodies, leading to allergic or immune complex hypersensitivities, rapid clearance of the antibody, and reduced clinical efficacy. 13,46 -51 Initially, Morrison and colleagues 48,52 introduced chimeric MAbs in 1984, which showed several advantages over unmodified rodent antibodies. Generally, chimeras combine the human constant regions with the intact rodent variable regions, replicating the rodent antibody variable regions by PCR and then cloning them into eukaryotic expression vectors containing human constant regions. 49 Ideally, this allows better interaction with human effector cells and the complement system. Because the Fc region has little influence on the structure of the Fv region, the chimeric constructs' affinity and specificity are virtually unchanged, and both rodent and chimeric antibodies cause apoptosis at a similar rate and intensity against target cells in vitro. 50, 51, 55 Although chimeric antibodies have helped solve some of the problems associated with the use of rodent MAbs, they still show significant immunogenicity in humans; because of their approximately 30% mouse sequence, they cause an human-antichimeric antibody response.

Humanized antibodies containing only the CDRs of the rodent variable region grafted onto the human variable region framework have been introduced to overcome these deficiencies. 53 The early work on recombinant, chimeric, and rodent/human antibodies happened during the mid 1980s and, by the late 1980s, Greg Winters and his colleagues demonstrated that a functional human-like antibody could be created by grafting the antigen-binding CDRs from variable domains of rodent antibodies onto human variable domains. Numerous humanized antibodies have now been designed and constructed, and many are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. 13, 14, 39, 47, 54 Efficient procedures for constructing humanized antibodies have been developed. 13, 14, 47, 55 The first step is to clone and sequence the complementary DNAs (cDNAs), coding for the variable domains of the mouse antibody to be humanized. The mouse hybridoma cell line is grown in an appropriate culture medium, and cells are harvested for RNA isolation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers that hybridize to the 5' ends of the mouse leader sequences and to the 5' ends of the mouse constant regions are designed for cloning light chain variable regions and heavy chain variable regions. cDNA is synthesized from total RNA, followed by PCR amplification with light and heavy chain specific primers. Positive bacterial colonies containing mouse variable regions are then screened.

Construction of a chimeric antibody involves modifying the cloned mouse leader-variable regions at the 5'-and 3'-ends, using PCR primers to create restriction enzyme sites for convenient insertion into expression vectors, to incorporate sequences for efficient eukaryotic translation, and to incorporate splice-donor sites for RNA splicing of the variable and constant regions. The adapted mouse light and heavy chain leader-variable regions are inserted into vectors containing, for example, human cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter for transcription, a human light or heavy chain constant region, a neomycin gene for selection of transformed cells, and the simian virus 40 origin of replication in COS cells. These vectors are designed to express chimeric or reshaped human light and heavy chains in mammalian cells.

The design and construction of an engineered human antibody require an analysis of the primary amino acid sequences of the mouse variable regions to identify the residues most critical in forming the antigen-binding site. A structural model of the mouse variable region is built on the basis of homology to known antibody variable regions. The framework regions (FRs) of the new variable regions are modeled on FRs from structurally similar immunoglobulin variable regions. The design process involves selecting human light and heavy chain variable regions that will serve as templates for the construction of a reshaped human antibody. The mouse CDRs are then joined to the FRs from selected human variable regions. The primary amino acid sequences are then carefully analyzed to ascertain whether they would recreate an antigen-binding site that mimics the original mouse antibody.

Within the FRs, the amino acid differences between the mouse and the human sequences are examined, and the relative importance of each amino acid in the formation of antigen-binding site is evaluated. Minimum changes in the FRs are desirable and should closely match the sequences from natural human antibodies. Any potential glycosylation site in the FRs of either mouse or human sequence needs to be identified and its influence on antigen binding considered.

The DNA sequences coding for the reshaped human variable regions, either made synthetically or based on an existing sequence that is very similar to the newly designed reshaped human variable region, are modified by PCR with specially designed oligonucleotide primers. The human variable regions together with their leader sequences are then cloned into a mammalian expression vector that already contains human constant regions. Each human variable region is linked to the desired constant region via an intron.

Preliminary expression and analysis of the reshaped human antibodies are done by cotransfection of mammalian cell-expression vectors, 1 coding for human light chain and 1 coding for human heavy chain. The vectors will replicate in the COS cells and transiently express and secrete reshaped human antibodies. The concentration of the antibody produced can be analyzed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific changes in the amino acids of the framework region may also be required to preserve the orientation and structure of the rodent CDR required for binding. Computer modeling using databases containing human variable genes will identify sequences homologous to the rodent V regions. 13, 47 A computer model of the rodent Fv can identify the non-CDR residues that interact with the CDR sequences, and choices can be made regarding which residues need to be included in the variable region.

Antibodies humanized in this way may have binding affinities up to one-third greater than the corresponding murine antibodies. 49 Allergenicity is also significantly reduced. About 20 to 40% of patients exhibit a HAMA reaction to murine antibodies, whereas only about 7% have a similar reaction to humanized antibodies. 47,53,56 -58 Humanization of MAbs still has several practical difficulties. First, a detailed knowledge of the antibody structure and function is required. Second, methods for efficient construction of humanized MAbs are limited. Third, unpredictable immunogenicity may result when a new amino acid sequence is introduced to balance affinity retention. Fourth, the antibody repertoire is limited to the animal in which the progenitor MAb originated. Fifth, the rodent MAb producing hybridoma must be isolated and thoroughly characterized.

However, obstacles to humanization are gradually being surmounted. Karpas et al 15 reported creating a HAT-sensitive and ouabain-resistant human myeloma cell line that can fuse with human lymphoblast cells. A HAT-sensitive subline of the myeloma cells that secreted only light chains was fused with EBV-transformed white blood cells that produced IgG MAbs to HIV-1 gp41. Eventually, a clone was isolated that was polyethylene glycol-resistant and would not revert when placed in HAT medium. Standard polyethylene glycol fusion protocol was followed to fuse the myeloma cells with both EBVtransformed white cells and fresh white cells obtained from the peripheral blood of adults and tonsil cells from 2 children. The authors reported promising rates of hybridoma formation, stable Ig production, and high yield of secreted antibodies compared with antibody-producing cell lines from mouse myeloma cells. The authors have now developed 40 hybridomas that have been secreting cells for more than 5 months.

A human myeloma cell line may eventually prove useful in creating MAbs against certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. This technique may also make it easier for other researchers to generate human MAbs for use in therapy.

Antibodies may act directly when binding to a target molecule by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell growth, mimicking or blocking a ligand, or interfering with a key function. 53, 59 In addition, antibodies may modulate or potentiate drugs or other therapies. The antibody may itself act as an effector-as in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent complement-mediated cascade-or it may involve effector elements such as cytotoxins, enzymes, radioactive isotopes, signals for other parts of the immune system, and/or cytotoxic drugs. 49,50,60 -62 ADCC occurs if Fc regions on the antibodies are recognized by receptors present on cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and monocytes. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity ensues if the antibody binding prompts a complement cascade to occur. Active immunotherapy can be accomplished if the antigen can provoke a long-lasting T-cell response, which may be achieved by administering whole cancer cell extracts or by using small antigenic peptides isolated from tumors in experimental patients or animals. 58 For instance, MAbs mimicking breast cancer-specific antigens elicit anti-idiotype antibodies; this is another way of creating active immunity, which can lead to a humoral auto antibody-like immune response. 58 The use of bispecific molecules that recognize antigens on both the target cell and effector cell can increase ADCC. The most effective mechanisms are blockade of a crucial ligand or growth factor or ADCC in which tumor cells are killed by Fc receptorbearing cytotoxic effectors. Cell killing by ADCC is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to a cell, whereas the blockade of an essential growth factor may not show effects until most of its receptor is saturated. A higher antigen expression by the target cell will increase antibody binding and subsequent ADCC. But high receptor expression will also make it difficult to prevent the binding of a cytokine or ligand at minimum threshold. 53, 59, 63 With a bispecific antibody, the specificity of MAb is combined with the cytotoxicity of immune effector cells, for instance, to neutralize a tumor. 9, 45, 63, 64 Bispecific antibodies link the tumor cell directly to the killer cell via cytotoxic trigger molecules, such as T-cell receptors or Fc receptors, leading to lysis and/or phagocytosis by the effector cells. Although bispecific antibodies can enrich effectors at the tumor site and activate tumor bound effector cells by enabling cross-linking between effector and target cells, they can cause system-wide immune activation because of T-cell receptor cross-linking. Bispecific antibodies can also mediate cellular cytotoxicity via various effector cells, including phagocytes, natural killer cells, and T-lymphocytes.

Another way to use the binding properties of antibodies is by conjugating antibodies to cytotoxic drugs, radioisotopes, or toxins. 49, 58, 63, 65, 66 Techniques for conjugation have been described in several recent reviews and articles. 49, 58, 67, 70 MAbs can be conjugated to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, mitomycin, and methotrexate. Chemotherapeutic agents constitute cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs that can be conjugated to antibodies; thus far, however, these drugs have shown poor specificity for target cells and frequently lead to toxicity. 55, 62, 65 Often, antibodies may lose reactivity upon conjugation with such agents. Immunotoxins used in cancer therapy are conjugated antibodies that combine plant (ricin, gelonin, saponin, abrin, pokeweed antiviral protein) or bacterial (diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas toxin A) toxins with antibody specificity. 52, 59, 62, 63, 65, 66, 68, 69 Toxins may inhibit protein synthesis even at picomolar concentrations. Natural toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, can act at low concentrations, enter cells, and disrupt key cellular processes. 69 Enzymes may also be conjugated to antibodies in antibody-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. 55, 61, 62, 66, 71 An enzyme that can convert a prodrug to an active form may be conjugated to an antibody and targeted to a desired location using the antibody-binding region. They may more effectively localize tumors than chemical conjugates, and a prodrug is converted to an active drug by the enzyme at the target cells.

Another therapeutic technique relies on using antibody fragments, which may be produced by the traditional method (proteolytic digestion with papain) or with newer methods that may reduce damage to the binding sites. 66, 71 Some newer methods attempt to construct mimetics that combine multiple CDRs from several antibodies into single molecules with molecular weights substantially lower than single chain fragments. Because of their smaller size, antibody fragments may be able to penetrate tissues and tumors more readily and be less immunogenic than whole MAbs. However, although antibody fragments may have better penetration than whole antibodies, their shorter half-lives may compromise clinical usefulness. 68 Heteropolymerized antibodies have recently been developed by chemically linking a mouse IgG MAb, specific to a complement receptor site (CR1) on the human or nonhuman primate erythrocyte, to a second mouse IgG MAb that is specific to the targeted antigen. 72 The heteropolymer technique is based on immune adherence, in which antibody-antigen immune complexes bind to a complement receptor on the red blood cell, facilitating the phagocytosis of these complexes. 72 Once introduced into the patient, the heteropolymers will bind to both the red blood cells and the targeted antigen. The antigen-antibody heteropolymer complexes are then transported to the liver and spleen, where the complexes are destroyed by macrophages, whereas the red blood cells return to the circulation unharmed. [72] [73] [74] [75] A wide variety of conditions, of both autoimmune and foreign origin, may potentially be treated with this method, including HIV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, Marburg virus infection, and myasthenia gravis. 76 -78 Although mouse antibodies are currently being used with this technique, chimeric mousehuman antibodies could also be constructed. 72 It may also be possible to use the heteropolymers as ""sentinels"" by injecting them before antigen exposure. In 1 recent study, multiple infusions of heteropolymers provided nonimmunized monkeys with protection against an antigen (⌽174) for as long as 2 weeks. 79

When Milstein and Kohler announced their isolation of a MAb in 1975, many thought MAbs would provide an effective cancer treatment. However, early clinical trials were disappointing. 80 -81 Producing MAbs to tumor antigens is a complex process. First, proteins peculiar to human cancer cells are identified; then, mice are injected with human tumor cells (antigen) to stimulate an immune response. After about 30 days, the mouse lymphocytes are removed and fused with myeloma cells to isolate and reproduce hybrid cells specific to a predetermined antigen. Rodent antibodies alone have been used in several trials, but the clinical effects are often minimal because of poor activation of human effector or complement cells by the Fc region of the murine antibody and the accompanying HAMA responses. 55, 57 Substituting the rodent Fc region with a human Fc fragment may help overcome these effects. 81 With the discovery of proto-oncogenes, secondgeneration trials in the 1990s turned to more specific tumor antigens that could be potential targets. 58 In 1994, MAb 17-1A, an antibody to epithelial cell surface antigen expressed on human colorectal carcinomas, was approved for the identification of adenocarcinomas; MAb17-1A may reduce the mortality and occurrence rate of colorectal cancer. 82, 83 In 1997, rituximab, a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, was approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. 53, 83 Rituximab binds to CD20 antigen on B cells and B cell tumors and then elicits a natural immune response that can kill malignant cells. Recent animal trials have shown the potential of MAb therapy in cancer. 52 Increases in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression have been found on many human cancers, and a fully human anti-EGF receptor IgG2 MAb has been shown to inhibit human cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. 22 Other efforts are focusing on antibody to HER2 antigen in breast cancer. Patients with cancer often mount an immunologic response to tumor-associated antigens with increases in cytotoxic lymphocytes and antibodies. 14 Several tumor-reactive antibodies have been cloned against melanomas, colon carcinomas, ovarian, breast, and lung tumors. Often, these antibodies cross-react with other malignant tissues or cell lines. 14 Recently, trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized MAb that binds directly to the C-erB2 protein (HER2), has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. 52,84 -89 Herceptin can be used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein (about 30% of breast cancer patients) and may be used in conjunction with other therapies such as paclitaxel (Taxol). 89 Antibody was developed by humanizing murine MAb 4d5 by inserting antigen-binding regions of MAb 4d5 into the framework of a consensus human IgG1, resulting in rhuMab-Her2 or trastuzumab. 85 Cancer cells have antigens that are specific to the tumor (tumor-specific antigens) or are present in greater concentration than normal (tumor-associated antigens). Antibodies may eliminate target cells by complement action or through ADCC. The variable region of the antibody recognizes and attaches to a specific antigen and the constant region, then joins with an effector cell capable of killing the targeted cancer cell. When the antigen and antibody bind, precipitation and agglutination may isolate the complex. Anti-idiotype MAbs that mimic-tumor associated antigens also may be used in cancer therapy. 82 The idiotype network hypothesis, formulated by Lindemann and Jerne, suggests that because each mature B cell secretes an antibody with unique antigenbinding specificity in the variable domain (referred to as the idiotype), anti-idiotype MAbs can be generated and used as surrogate antigens or vaccines for immunization against the tumor. 82, 90 A murine anti-idiotype MAb, ACA125, which mimics the tumor-associated antigen CA125, was recently found to induce a specific anti-anti-idiotypic immune response in 28 of 42 patients with platinum-pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial. 90,91 A positive immune response was associated with statistically significant (P Ͻ 0.0001) prolonged survival times (19.9 Ϯ 3.1 months in patients shown to have an anti-antiidiotypic response compared with 5.3 Ϯ 4.3 months in patients who were anti-anti-idiotypic negative). 90, 91 In addition, peripheral blood lymphocyte mediated lysis of CA-125 expressing tumor cells increased in 9 of 18 patients after vaccination with the MAb. 91 Despite the use of a murine antibody, both this study and a previous phase I study involving patients with ovarian cancer found minimal side effects. 90, 91 Promising early results have also been demonstrated in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who received a murine anti-idiotype MAb that mimics an epitope of carcinoembryonic antigen (CeaVac) 82, 90 and in patients with malignant melanoma who received an anti-idiotype MAb (TriGem) that mimics disialoganglioside GD2 92 Despite promising developments, however, there are still several obstacles to effective cancer therapy with MAbs. Problems with the tumor, the MAb, or conjugate characteristics all continue to challenge researchers. 52, 63, 84 Thus far, chemotherapeutic MAb therapies have faced obstacles due to the poor ability of agents to affect tumor cells preferentially over healthy cells, the intrinsic insensitivity of many tumors to these drugs, and the rapid development of resistance in tumor cells. 65, 66, 93, 94 MAbs often decrease the size of tumors, but rarely lead to complete remission of solid tumors. 59 At the cellular level, MAbs at low doses ideally should bind with excellent affinities. Because no antigens have been identified that are expressed exclusively on tumor cells, cross-reactivity of MAbs must be examined with histochemical tests on tissue sections or in animal models. Careful testing must also be done to ensure that the effector molecules such as drugs, toxins, or isotopes in the conjugates do not inadvertently target healthy cells. Although humanized antibodies have greater affinity than murine antibodies, this potential has yet to be translated into improved clinical outcomes against cancer. 52 However, recent success using the XenoMouse technology to develop a fully human IgG2 MAb specific to epidermal growth factor receptor indicates the potential for future advances in this area. 22

Recombinant immunotoxins, fusion proteins containing the Fv of a MAb and a bacterial toxin, are under development for cancer therapy. Because immunotoxins exploit only the variable region-binding function of the MAb, in theory just a fragment of the binding region, such as the bivalent F(ab')2 fragment, monovalent Fab, scFV, or disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments may be used as opposed to the larger and probably more immunogenic whole antibody. Disulfide-stabilized fragments may be more stable or have higher affinity for the antigen than scFV, in which the linker may interfere with binding or fail to stabilize the fragment. 66 Recombinant immunotoxins derived from Pseudomonas enterotoxin have been shown to be active against lymphomas, solid tumors, and leukemias. 66 Because binding specificity and affinity are the key elements, it is not known which form of the immunoconjugate is usually more effective in treating human tumors; some animal tests suggest that the whole antibody, with its longer half-life and bivalent binding, is more effective than the antibody fragments with decreased binding affinity.

Bispecific antibodies and single chain FVs are being developed that may be more effective because they clear faster from nontumor tissues and more deeply penetrate tumors than whole antibodies. 49, 64, 70 Bispecific antibodies may be used to target tumor vascular endothelial cells, thereby limiting the tumor's blood supply and possibly inhibiting its spread. 70

Advances in radiolabeling have allowed immunoconjugates to be delivered to cells and showed promise in clinical trials. 14, 63, 80, 95, 96 Radioimmunotherapy uses a radiolabeled MAb to deliver radioactive isotopes to targeted cells. Radioisotopes such as iodine-131 and yttrium-90, which are ␤ emitters, can cause damage not only to the bound cell but also to cells adjacent to tumor cells that antibodies may not be able to reach within the tumors. Lack of knowledge about the appropriate dose, biodistribution, and shedding of antigen hinders use of radioisotopes.

Radiolabeled MAbs may also affect normal cells, depending on the extent to which reticuloendothelial cells expressing Fc receptors bind to the constant regions of intact antibody molecules. Using antibody fragments or constructs may modify this nonspecific uptake. 63, 68, 82, 93 Radiotherapy exerts most of its effect by emitting a low dose, which exponentially decreases continuous radiation, but the antibody per se may have a cytotoxic effect. The duration of radiotherapy is determined by the half-lives of the antibody and the isotope used. The success of radioimmunotherapy is affected by the specificity, affinity, dose, and immunoreactivity of the antibody, heterogeneity of antigen expression, diffusion rate, tumor volume, blood supply and tumor location, dose rate effects, and variability in dose deposition. The choice of radionuclide, selection of the chelate used to link the MAb to the radionuclide, and the MAb selected are critical in development of radiolabeled MAbs. 80 Suitable radio nuclides include yttrium-90, iodine-131, and copper-67. Iodine-131 was the first radioisotope to be used in treatment of Hodgkin disease and other lymphomas. 68 Yttrium-90 is potentially useful for lymphoma therapy because it decays with ␤, but not ␥, emissions that may kill other tumor cells in a cross-fire effect. 68 The energy released by yttrium is 5 times higher than that of iodine-131, which degrades rapidly after uptake into a tumor cell, causing toxicity. 80 In addition to their uses in radiotherapy, radiolabeled MAbs can also be used to diagnose cancer. 18, 56, 57, 82, 94 Radioactive isotopes linked with MAbs may help localize tumors in a form of diagnostic imaging called immunoscintigraphy. For instance, OncoScint, a MAb coupled to indium-111, may be used to detect an antigen (TAG-72) found on colorectal adenocarcinomas. 56

MAbs may potentially be used to suppress the immune system after transplant or to induce tolerance to transplanted organs or tissues. Thus far, however, only antibodies to CD3 and CD25 are licensed for clinical use. 97 OKT3, a murine IgG2a antibody to human CD3, and antibodies to CD25 (Il-2 receptor) have been used to reduce allograft rejection. 97 Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic stem cell transplant that occurs despite histocompatibility testing and use of cyclosporine and its analogs. 98 GVHD is a frequent cause of illness or death in allogeneic transplant patients and occurs when alloselective donor T cells recognize and interact with major and minor histocompatibility antiigens in the host, leading to cytokine release.

MAb therapy against GVHD is most effective when it is administered after a bone marrow transplant but before GVHD development by targeting T-cells before their activation. 99 For instance, 1 target is the interleukin-2 receptor ␣-chain (IL-2R␣ Tac protein or CD25), whose expression is a crucial step in the activation of alloreactive T cells. 97, 100 Recently, it was reported that daclizumab, a humanized anti-IL-2a antibody, was an effective complement to dual immunosuppression therapy in renal transplant patients. 101 Because only activated cells express IL-2, antibodies to this cytokine might inhibit T cells during allograft rejection and prevent generation of cytotoxic T cells. The development of HAMA response in patients and the decreased effectiveness of murine MAb relative to human MAb have thus far compromised the effectiveness of this approach. However, humanized anti-Tac MAbs, with better human effector functions, may survive longer in vivo and may prove less immunogenic than its murine counterpart. Short-term CD4 antibody therapy may also contribute to long-term acceptance of skin and islet allografts, even after gaining immunocompetence. 102 More generally, the ability of MAbs to induce tolerance to transplanted tissues and self-antigens may hold great therapeutic potential. 97, 102 MAbs to CD4 and CD8 have been studied, although thus far these have not resulted in clinical success. 97 Depletion or blockade of T cells by antibodies may facilitate tolerance by preventing T cells from attacking the graft, and recent T cell depletion studies in primates have proven promising. 97 MAb treatments for other complications after transplants are also under study, including potential treatment of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with the anti-CD20 MAb rituximab and the use of anti-LFA-1 MAb (odulimomab) to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury after kidney transplants. [103] [104] [105] Daclizumab, a humanized antibody that targets the anti IL-2 receptor, may reduce the risk of acute rejection of a renal transplant and also lower cytomegalovirus infection rates among transplant recipients. 106 The inflammatory bowel disorder known as Crohn disease has also been treated with MAb therapy. 107 A chimeric IgG1k antibody, infliximab (Remicade), acts by binding to soluble and transmembrane tumor necrosis factor ␣ (TNF␣), preventing it from binding to its receptors on activated macrophages. The anti-TNF␣ antibody may provide relief to patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In addition, the FDA recently approved infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate. 108 -111 

High levels of IgE may cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a risk factor for asthma. [112] [113] [114] Im-Therapeutic Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies mune responses mediated by IgE are important in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. In 1 recent study with subjects reporting moderate to severe allergic asthma, twice-weekly injections of recombinant humanized anti-IgE antibody (rhuMAB-E25), which forms complexes with free IgE and blocks its interaction with mast cells and basophils led to a fall in serum IgE levels and slightly decreased asthma symptom scores relative to the placebo group. 112 Patients receiving anti-IgE were able to reduce reliance on corticosteroids. Although the study must be interpreted cautiously, it is nonetheless a promising step in finding more effective asthma therapies. 112, 114, 116 

Approximately 400,000 cases of sepsis in the US and about 25,000 cases in the UK are reported each year. 116, 117 The mortality rate could be as high as 40 to 70%, depending on the population studied. 117, 118 MAbs have been targeted to TNF␣ and TNF␣ receptors, which are key elements of the inflammatory response. Unfortunately, this may inhibit many cytokines, which can impair the patients' ability to fight infection and increase the risk of secondary sepsis; also inhibiting a few cytokines may not be sufficient. Although MAbs targeted toward components of the host immune system, such as individual receptors or mediator cells, help in the treatment of septic shock, targeting the bacterial endotoxin or lipid A of gram-negative bacteria with MAbs may be more efficacious. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, a component of the outer cell membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, consisting of a highly variable O-linked polysaccharide chain, an R core region, and lipid A, which in turn is composed of a glucosamine disaccharide backbone substituted with amide-and ester-linked long-chain fatty acids, is believed to be important in many cases of septic shock and septicemia, and can trigger an inflammatory cascade that can cause serious injury and even death. 119, 120 Lipid A is linked by the core region to the O-linked side chain, and variations in the O-linked side chains result in an enormous diversity among Gram-negative bacteria, making adoptive immunotherapy against the O-linked antigenic determinants difficult. 114 Directing antibodies to the core region or lipid A, which tend to be more conserved, would allow for therapy against a diverse array of Gram-negative bacteria. Favorable results with polyclonal J5 antibody have spurred attempts to develop a MAb. 116, 117 A murine IgM MAb, E5 (XOMA, Berkeley, CA) binds to an epitope on lipid A of E coli J5. A human IgM, HA-1A (Centoxin) is derived from a heterohybridoma fused from spleen cells of a patient vaccinated with E coli J5 before splenectomy. 116, 117, 119, 121 Both the antibodies have thus far shown mixed success in patients with sepsis and neither is currently cleared by the FDA for therapeutic use. Because patients with bacteremia often have endotoxemia, HA-1A, an IgM antibody to endotoxin may be effective against endotoxin in the bloodstream as well. Unfortunately, the high cost of antibody ($3500/dose in Europe) combined with the uncertainty that the sepsis is caused by Gram-negative bacteria has hindered the widespread use of HA-1A. 112, 115, 117 Although it is less efficacious, the only other option may be to target TNF␣, but 1 recent study reported a high (54.1%) rate of adverse reactions in patients receiving an anti-TNF␣ antibody. 118 The antibody was no more effective than the placebo given to control subjects. However, research on a MAb for the treatment of septicemia continues.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes serious illness affecting the immunocompromised, such as patients with AIDS and those undergoing organ transplants. Infection rates may be up to 75% in those negative for CMV who receive kidneys from seropositive patients. 122 CMV infection can result in retinitis and gastroenteritis in HIV-infected patients and may also cause chronic intrauterine infection. 122, 123 Up to 40,000 cases of congenital CMV infection are reported each year; mental retardation and hearing loss may occur in about 25% of these cases. 122 Currently, there is no vaccine against CMV. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine are some of the potential treatments for CMV infection. 122 Another mode of treatment is via administration of anti-CMV hyperimmunoglobulin, derived from pooled sera of CMVseropositive persons. Passive immunization has been shown to reduce the severity of CMV and prevent mother-to-infant transmissions. 122 Moreover, antibodies may be able to clear the virus from infected tissues, a function previously thought to be exclusive to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Many physicians use a combination of antiviral agents and immunoglobulins in patients at risk for CMV infection. MAbs may also decrease the amount of antiviral agents required for treatment. MAbs against murine CMV polypeptides have been shown to be protective in animal models. 124 Although MAbs may act synergistically with foscarnet or ganciclovir in vitro, it is unclear whether this advantage could be extrapolated to in vivo conditions. Experiments in which murine CMV is used as a model system suggest that high concentrations of antibody, along with ganciclovir or (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-(2 phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine, synergistically inhibit the growth of murine CMV in cell culture, whereas lower antibody concentrations produce only an additive effect. However, antibody ad-ministered along with ganciclovir in severe combined immunodeficient mice also produced only an additive effect. 123 The extent to which a MAb can protect the host from CMV infection cannot reliably be predicted from its immunoreactivity, neutralizing titers in vitro, or from its antigen-binding data, because the mechanism of action of a MAb in vitro and in vivo may be entirely different. 124 If an antibody is used along with drugs, not only is the treatment efficacy improved but also the side effects of a high drug concentration may be avoided. For instance, 25 mg of ganciclovir/kg of body weight, along with an antibody, was almost as effective as 50 mg/kg ganciclovir administered alone in CMV-infected severe combined immunodeficient mice. 124 The MSL109 antibody, a human IgG1 directed against human CMV glycoprotein, is marginally synergistic in inhibiting CMV in vitro when conjugated to ganciclovir or foscarnet. In a recent trial involving 209 AIDS patients with active CMV retinitis, the rate of retinitis progression was similar in the group receiving the antibody (60 mg, intravenous) for 2 weeks and the placebo control group. 125 Surprisingly, mortality increased in the MSL-109 group, and the poor performance of MSL-109 in this trial may have been due to the inability of the antibody to neutralize the established CMV infection in AIDS patients or its failure to cross the blood-ocular barrier in sufficient quantities.

Liver transplant patients are also at risk of CMV infection and may require treatment with the murine MAb OKT3, an anti-T cell antibody that is directed to CD3 antigen, along with ganciclovir to mitigate transplant rejection. 126 Human MAbs neutralizing CMV were tested for their safety and pharmacokinetics over a period of 3 to 73 days in bone marrow transplant recipients and were found to be safe and efficacious, as evidenced by a steady increase in the neutralizing activity. 127 Also, a human anti-CMV MAb designated C23 that was purified from hybridomas generated by the fusion of human lymphocytes with mouse myeloma cells has virus neutralization titers about 1000-fold higher than those produced after conventional human ␥ globulin used in humans. 128 A humanized MAb has been developed that binds to the 86-kd glycoprotein, gpUL75 (gH), of CMV, recognizes a variety of virus strains, and neutralizes clinical isolates of CMV; it could be used as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of CMV infections in humans. 129 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring considerable supportive care, administration of humidified oxygen, and respiratory assistance. The FDA approved the use of a humanized MAb against RSV, which afflicts mostly infants and children younger than 24 months of age. 130, 131 Known as palivizumab, the antibody (produced by Synagis and MedImmune, Inc.) treatment showed a 55% reduction in RSV infection in hospitalized patients. 130, 131 The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases has published recommendations on the use of this antibody in children at risk for RSV infection. 130, 131 MAbs have also been used in the therapy of HSV infections. The incidence of neonatal herpes is 30 to 50% in babies born vaginally to mothers with primary infection but only 1 to 3% in babies born to mothers with recurrent infections. 132 This difference is attributed to the passive transfer of protective antibodies to the fetus. Antibodies to HSV-1 may also confer partial protection against type 2 strains. Based on this observation, the potential of MAb therapy against herpes has been studied for more than a decade. Experiments in mice, for instance, indicate that microgram quantities of antibodies may promote healing of corneal opacity and blepharitis caused by herpes simplex. 133 However, attempts to confer immunity in humans and other higher animals by passive immunization alone have been disappointing, because antibodies to HSV are restricted to only a few specific epitopes. 133 Among the 11 glycoproteins expressed by the herpes virus on its surface, 5 glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, gK, and gL) are thought to be crucial to infection. The initial step in HSV infection seems to be the binding of gC to heparan sulfate proteoglycans followed by the binding of gB, and the binding of gB and gC is stabilized by gD. gH is involved in initiation of viral fusion and other glycoproteins may help in expanding the fusion process.

Evidence that neutralizing antibodies to gH, gD, and gB prevent membrane fusion but not viral attachment is consistent with this model. 133 Most human antibodies are directed against gD and gB epitopes. MAbs can target at least 7 different antigenic sites on HSV glycoprotein D in the murine model. 133, 134 Glycoprotein D is necessary for virus replication in tissue culture. Yamamoto et al 135 reported the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity effect of HS1, a neutralizing MAb to glycoprotein B of HSV, in athymic nude mice inoculated with HSV intracutaneously. When HS1 is administered, the skin lesions healed in 50% of the mice given the antibody. Also, latent infection in the ganglia was prevented in mice that survived, as evidenced by the failure to detect HSV upon co-cultivation with Vero cells. Administration of HS1 after development of zosteriform lesions (5 to 9 days after infection) reduced the virus in the ganglia and prolonged survival time; however, the disease was not totally avoided and eventually the mice succumbed to the disease. The antibody therapy could prevent or decrease the severity of herpetic keratitis, iritis, and blepharitis after corneal infection by HSV. 136, 137 Thus, MAbs could potentially be used to prevent congenital herpes and sexual transmission of the herpes virus. 47, 133, 138, 139 

Currently, no treatments exist for the hemorrhagic fever caused by the filovirus Ebola. Recently, a team of researchers at the US Army's Medical Research Institute identified protective antibodies directed against epitopes on Ebola virus membraneanchored glycoprotein. Some of the antibodies protected mice as long as 2 days after exposure; doses were equivalent to acceptable (3 to 5 mg/kg) human levels. Antibody specificity is important, because some MAbs studied bound to Ebola Zaire but not to the Ivory Coast or Sudan serotypes. Much research remains to be done before the potential of antibodies in the treatment of Ebola will become realized. 140

Toxins are poisonous proteinaceous substances. Antibodies were first clinically used in the 1970s for protection against the toxin digitalis. 48, 102 Today, antidigitalis immunotoxicotherapy is a standard therapy. Digoxin is produced from sheep immunized with digoxin-serum albumin conjugate. IgG antibody specific for digoxin is purified and cleaved into Fabs, because the smaller molecular mass of the fragments allows faster renal clearance and more rapid action than the whole antibody. The Fab fragments bind to circulating digitalis molecules and generate a complex that is unable to bind to receptors. Adverse effects are rare, and the immunotherapy is generally effective against digoxin and digitoxin within 1 hour. 120, 141 However, because polyclonal antibodies may be difficult to produce and may cause hypersensitive reactions, researchers have attempted to develop humanized MAbs against digoxin and other toxins. 141 For example, 1 group has used a transgenic mouse to produce hybridomasecreted human MAbs against digoxin. 141 More recently, the effect of goat anti-colchicine IgG antibodies has been studied in mice exposed to a lethal intraperitoneal dose of anti-inflammatory colchicines, and preliminary studies in a 25-yearold woman with colchicine poisoning showed promise. 102, 141 Attempts have also been made to use drug-specific goat antibody fragments to treat anti-tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. 120, 141 Antidepressant overdose is the most common cause of intentional drug overdose in the US. However, lethal doses of tricyclics are 10-to 100-fold higher than those of colchicine, digoxin, and snake venom, which require higher antibody doses (up to several g/kg) to reverse the toxicity. 120, 142 High-affinity tricyclic antidepressant-specific MAbs have been shown to reverse the cardiovascular toxicity of antidepressant desipramine in rats and prolong their survival, and tricyclic antidepressant-specific Fab fragments, along with sodium bicarbonate, a standard treatment for tricyclic overdose, also minimizes the required dose of antibody. 142 The use of smaller antibody fragments, such as single chain Fv fragments, half the size of a Fab, may also be a promising approach because the single chain fragment retains affinity and has shorter half-life in the body.

Monoclonal antibodies may also help to alleviate poisoning due to environmental contamination. Hexachlorobiphenyl, paraquat, atrazine, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, the chief degradation byproduct of the insecticides chloropyrifos, triclopyr, and chloroprifosmethyl, and other chemicals may soon be detected and remediated with the help of antibodies. 139, [143] [144] [145] Antibodies may also be used in the treatment of poisoning due to paraquat, hexachlorobiphenyl, domoic acid [amnesic shellfish poisoning], and other contaminants that are otherwise difficult to remove from the body or surrounding environment. [145] [146] [147] [148] 

The primary target of many abused drugs is the central nervous system (CNS), and immunotherapy against such chemicals must be able to penetrate the CNS. 149 PCP or phencyclidine (angel dust) is a type of arylcyclohexamine that affects multiple sites in the brain. 150, 151 It is linked to violent psychotic episodes that are similar to schizophrenia. 149 Treatment is difficult because there is no known antagonist identified, PCP has a high volume of distribution, and about 95% of it is cleared after being metabolized. 151 Recently, MAbs have been described that could bind to cocaine or PCP and act like sponges in the bloodstream to prevent them from reaching the brain. 152 It has been shown that a single dose of antibody reduced PCP effects for up to 2 weeks in animals, which might be equivalent to a several months in humans. High-affinity antibody 6b5 fragments against PCP function better in that the fragments with bound PCP are more quickly cleared from the body than the whole antibodybound PCP. 153 The crystal structure of the antibody fragment complexed with PCP has been studied in detail. 154 Antibody fragments are also preferable to whole antibodies in the treatment of PCP addiction because of their lower antigenicity and improved pharmacokinetics. 149, 151 Anti-idiotype antibodies could potentially be produced against the drug-MAb binding site and mimic drug structural features, although these antibodies do not cross the bloodbrain barrier. 151 By increasing protein binding in the vascular compartment and lowering the drug's volume of distribution, the antibody acts like a pharmacokinetic antagonist. 150 Evidence that the antibody can also reverse effects of other potent arylcyclohexylamine drugs suggests that antibody medications can be used to treat different classes of drugs. 150, 151 An anti-PCP IgG has been produced from a hybridoma cell line using both ascites and bioreactor methods, and the pharmacological and immune specificity of the antibody has been confirmed by administering the anti-PCP fragment to rats in three different studies without producing observable effects in behavior. 155 Active immunotherapy against methamphetamine addiction is also being contemplated. 156 Antibody therapy for cocaine addiction is also a possibility, especially with the development of catalytic antibodies having enzyme-like characteristics that can be used to inactivate drugs. 151, [157] [158] [159] Antibodies with esterase activity have been successfully mimicked, and because cocaine is believed to be metabolized by in vivo esterases, such antibodies would be useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction. 151 Catalytic antibodies probably would not be as useful as high-affinity anti-cocaine antibodies, but could be used in medical emergencies or as part of a withdrawal therapy. 151 Potential antibody applications against cocaine addiction have been tested in rats with a vaccine approach by (1) attaching cocaine molecules to a carrier protein for immunizing rats to produce antibodies against cocaine and (2) humanizing anticocaine antibodies derived from rats and producing them in bacteria. 152, 160 A catalytic MAb (15A10) has recently been reported to attenuate cocaine's cardiovascular effects in mice. 155, 159 Conclusion About 200 years have elapsed since Edward Jenner vaccinated a young child against smallpox. Since that time, the field of immunology has evolved at a rapid pace and has yielded many critical developments. Although vaccination has thus far proven to be the most cost-effective method of preventing diseases worldwide, the development of MAbs that use the specificity of immunological responses is one of the most successful applications of immunology to date. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have reduced the risk of allergenicity from exposure to nonself antibodies and heightened the clinical effectiveness of MAb treatments. Developments in radiology and pharmacology have allowed radiolabeled and immunoconjugated antibodies to be produced. Antibody fragments, heteropolymers, and bispecific antibodies are now available in addition to whole MAbs. These promising developments may soon allow MAbs to be used to treat afflictions as varied as substance abuse, cancer, asthma, viral infection, septicemia, and poisoning. As Heddy Zola observed in 1995, ""The therapeutic application of MAbs, whilst still limited in scope, promises to break its substantial shackles and realize the potential forecast by its proponents."" 46

Human Monoclonal Antibodies as Adjuvant Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection,"Despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine leading to sterilizing immunity, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for chronic liver disease in more than 250 million individuals, potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for acute and chronic hepatitis, potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [reviewed in (1) ]. Hepatitis B can be effectively prevented by a prophylactic vaccine (2), whereas, antiviral drugs are virtually unable to eradicate the virus in chronically infected individuals despite efficient suppression of HBV DNA replication (3). Adaptive immunity plays a major role to provide long-term control of infection; however, the very low frequency of circulating HBV-specific T cells in chronic infection contributes to the inability to clear the virus (4) . Indeed, HBV may settle for life in occult form in the nuclei of hepatocytes as minichromosome (covalently closed circular DNA, cccDNA), despite apparent recovery, potentially reactivating in case of immune suppression (5) . The persistence of cccDNA in hepatocytes is the main hurdle to eradicate HBV infection. The problem is further compounded by the rapid decline of T-cell and B-cell responses as a result of exhaustion induced by production of large amounts of excess HBV envelope proteins (6), largely resulting from integration of HBV DNA sequences into the host genome particularly in the HBeAgnegative chronic HBV infection [reviewed in (7) ]. Of note, there is evidence that increased levels of HBsAg may contribute the CD8+ T cell dysfunction (8) , and that HBsAg induces disruption of TLR9-mediated Interferon-alpha production by circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (9, 10) . Moreover, HBVspecific T cells are mainly concentrated in the intrahepatic compartment together with a large number of HBV non-specific T cells (11) , which may contribute to maintain liver inflammation via antigen-independent by-stander activation (12) . Exhaustion caused by persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations provides the basis for T cell dysfunction, and results in upregulation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and other check-point molecules by HBV-specific CD8 T cells (13, 14) . In line with this interpretation, the intensity of the T cell response appears inversely correlated with HBV DNA levels, with more intense HBV-specific responses detectable in patients with lower viral loads.

B-cell responses also play a fundamental role in HBV infection. Antibodies specific for HBsAg are critical for the neutralization of free extracellular HBV, thus preventing viral entry into susceptible hepatocytes (15) . However, antibodies are unable to eradicate intracellular virus, a task fulfilled by MHC class I-restricted virus-specific CD8+ T cells by lytic and non-lytic mechanisms (16) . Anti-HBs antibodies are also produced during the chronic phase of the infection in minimal amount, most likely complexed by the large amount of the HBV envelope proteins present in the serum. Antibodies to the viral nucleoprotein, anti-HBc and anti-HBe, instead persist during chronic infection and detection of anti-HBe is linked to the emergence of the e-minus variant. The finding of undetectable HBV DNA by standard assays and anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg is taken as surrogate evidence of occult HBV infection (17) .

Current evidence supports the view that a coordinated activation of both T and B cells is critical for eradication of infection. Of note, CD4+ T cells control CD8+ T cell activity and antibody production (18) , and the inability of the infected host to mount robust virus-specific antibody responses correlates with a premature loss of CD4+ T cell responsiveness during the establishment of viral persistence in a chimpanzee model of HBV infection (19, 20) . Interestingly, sera containing hightiter anti-HBs antibodies provide protection upon exposure to HBV (21) , the eradication of which is closely related to the development of neutralizing anti-HBs antibodies. The discovery of the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as the receptor used by HBV to bind and infect liver cells allowed identification of the preS1 sequence which is used by HBV to bind liver cells and to characterize the role of anti-preS1 antibodies in the inhibition of HBV entry and infectivity (22) . The potency and efficiency of anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies in controlling HBV also comes from early evidence showing that hepatitis B vaccines may be efficacious even when given after exposure (2) and that administration of anti-HBs immunoglobulin can prevent reinfection of liver grafts (23) .

Humoral immunity seems to play an important, but only partially understood role in the control of HBV infection (24) . This is also exemplified by the observation that treatment of individuals with manifest or occult chronic HBV infection with specific anti-B cell therapy, e.g., the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, to treat autoimmune disease or non-Hodgkin lymphomas, may carry a substantial risk of HBV reactivation, even those who achieved HBsAg clearance and seroconversion to anti-HBs. Indeed, the rate of reactivation after rituximab is higher than for similarly matched patients treated with T cell immunosuppressive agents (25, 26) , pointing to the importance of B cell responses in the control of HBV.

In contrast with the wealth of studies on antibody responses to HBV proteins, there is limited information on the Bcell phenotypic and functional features during HBV infection, particularly during the chronic phase. Of note, and in contrast with evidence of exhausted T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic HBV infection, bulk peripheral blood B cells express several activation markers and produce large amounts of immunoglobulin in response to innate and adaptive immunity signals, significantly more than B cells from patients with chronic HCV infection (27) . In agreement with this vigorous polyclonal B-cell activation there was no evidence of upregulation of B-cell exhaustion markers, i.e., FcRL4, adding further support to the concept that the bulk B cell population apparently remains functionally intact in this setting. This would explain why in common practice patients with chronic HBV infection maintain the ability to produce antibodies to recall antigens and are able to respond to soluble protein vaccines. However, recent evidence indicates that, after enrichment, HBsAg-specific B cells show a phenotype of atypical memory B cells, a functionally defective subset which lack expression of CD21 and CD27 resulting from chronic pathogen exposure, particularly HIV infection (28) . These B cells demonstrated altered signaling, homing, differentiation into antibody-producing cells, survival and antiviral/proinflammatory cytokine production, that could be partially rescued by PD-1 blockade (29) . These findings suggest that persistent HBV infection drives an accumulation of atypical antigen-specific B cells with impaired antiviral capacity. These findings were akin to a simultaneously published study (30) , which suggested that B cell alterations were not limited to HBsAg-specific B cells but affected the global B cell population. However, this last finding would apparently be difficult to reconcile with previous evidence of conserved global B-cell function in chronic HBV infection (27) . Recent, interesting work from one of these two highly reputed laboratories shed light on the matter. Indeed, a comparative characterization of B cells specific for the HBV nucleocapsid and envelope proteins showed that HBcAg-specific B cells prevailed over HBsAg-specific in patients with chronic HBV infection and were able to efficiently differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting cells, compared with HBsAg-specific B cells. Moreover, HBcAgspecific B cells have a classical phenotypic and transcriptome profile of IgG+ memory B cells, whereas HBsAg-specific B cells were confirmed to have an atypical memory B cell profile. This is one of the first reports of dichotomous B-cell differentiation according to antigenic specificity in viral infections and provides a plausible explanation for the higher anti-HBc titers, relative to low anti-HBs titers observed in sera from patients with chronic hepatitis B (31) .

A recently identified family of regulatory cells, regulatory B cells (Bregs), was reported to control immune responses at the innate and the adaptive levels, and only a few studies have investigated the role of Bregs in chronic hepatitis B. Bregs classically suppress immune function through secretion of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, which inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and supports regulatory T cell differentiation. One study reported increased Breg cells in PBMC of patients with chronic HBV infection during spontaneous hepatic flares, demonstrating suppressive IL-10 mediated activity of Bregs on HBV-specific CD8 cells in vitro (32) . Enhanced serum levels of IL-10 have indeed been described in chronic hepatitis B, particularly in the so-called immune activation phase (33) . However, such temporal association with necro-inflammatory flares may either suggest a direct Breg responsibility via suppression of HBV-specific CD8 T cells, therefore diminishing viral control, or a secondary Breg-mediated modulation of the inflammatory flare induced by a virus-specific CD8 T cell response, to switch-off the exaggerated immune activation. Both scenarios probably apply to most chronic infections but further data are needed to better understand the role of Breg cells in this clinical setting.

Human memory B cells and plasma cells are a major source of antibodies. Indeed, B cells undergo somatic mutations and selection by antigen and T-cell help in response to pathogens and persist for life as memory cells in a given individual, rapidly responding to booster immunization to yield a large number of plasma cells. Even though long-lived plasma cells are the main source of serum antibodies, these terminally differentiated cells are certainly not ideal for long-term culture. Several methods have been developed to isolate human monoclonal antibodies (humAbs). The original relatively simple approach consists of the isolation of single antigen-specific Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cells from donors with hightiter specific immunoglobulin (Ig) after labor-intensive, timeconsuming rounds of cloning steps (34) . This approach is limited by the instability of the cell lines, the low level of specific antibody secretion, and the poor cloning efficiency, yielding low numbers of Ag-specific clones, usually <0.5% of the initially seeded wells. Improvements of the original methodology are represented by enrichment of antigen-specific B cells using fluorochromeconjugated antigen to capture B cells of interest, thus increasing the chances of obtaining specific antigen-specific B-cell clones [reviewed in (35) ]. This method has been successfully used, but potential technical issues pertaining to the antigen used may represent an unsurmountable hurdle. Another technique that has been extensively used includes phage-displayed antibody libraries with random pairs of antibody heavy and light chains, enabling the use of appropriate target antigens to screen specific antibodies with high affinity to the antigen (35) . Humanized transgenic mice may also provide an alternative option to obtain fully human therapeutic antibodies. In humanized transgenic mice, the endogenous murine antibody gene is replaced by human Ig loci (36) . Transgenic mice are then immunized with Ag to elicit specific human antibodies. Alternative approaches to improve the cloning efficiency of the original methodology have been considered, including selection of memory (CD27+) B cells and EBV immortalization and delivering an innate immunity signal, with a TLR9 agonist, such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, for potent activation of memory B cells (37) . EBV-transformed B-cells can then be further stabilized by fusion with non-Ig secreting mouse-human myeloma heterohybrids (34) . Using this approach, we have generated a number of humAbs specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (38) (39) (40) and more recently for HBV (41) . Among the HBV-specific humAbs developed, one derived from a vaccinated individual showed extremely potent neutralizing activity in a Tupaia belangeri model of HBV infection in vivo, whereas others apparently did not or had a low neutralization titer (41) . Interestingly, the humAb showing the highest neutralizing activity recognized a conformational epitope within the common ""a"" determinant in the major envelope protein (S), whereas, the remainder obtained from acute hepatitis B convalescents recognized linear epitope(s) in the same envelope polypeptide (41) . The data were not entirely superimposable to those obtained with a NTCP-expressing HepG2 cell line, as some of the in vivo poorly neutralizing humAbs were, instead, efficiently neutralizing in the NTCP-expressing cell line in vitro system (unpublished data). The anti-HBV humAbs were originally developed to obtain sustainable reagents for immunoprophylaxis of HBV re-infection in liver transplant recipients and other settings, such as treatment of accidental needle-sticks and in the prevention of vertical-perinatal HBV transmission. Anti-HBs antibodies are usually administered as an additional prophylactic measure while waiting for the appearance of neutralizing anti-HBs antibodies. However, it has not escaped our attention that another potentially important application may emerge in the future as an adjuvant treatment of chronic HBV infection.

Antibodies are usually effective in prophylaxis if given shortly after viral exposure, their efficiency declining after infection. However, highly potent and/or broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies may counteract viral escape mechanisms and open new avenues for intervention. For instance, potent HIV-1 envelope-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (superantibodies) have been identified that may have potential therapeutic applications (42) . In chronic hepatitis B, the potential advantage of anti-HBs humAb therapy relies on the possibility to regenerate effective T cell responses in patients with chronic HBV infection whose T cells are dysfunctional as a result of exposure to very large amounts of HBV envelope proteins produced in excess during viral replication. Indeed, removal of circulating HBsAg by neutralizing anti-HBs mAb was reported to rescue the exhausted adaptive immune responses to hepatitis B vaccination, eventually leading to anti-HBs seroconversion in a murine model (43) . It may, thus, be possible to apply this concept to treatment of chronic hepatitis B (Figure 1) . Notably, a murine anti-HBs mAb was employed to treat hypogammaglobulinemic HBVinfected individuals yielding reduced HBV DNA levels (44) . Moreover, a human anti-HBs mAb, alone or in combination with interferon-α, was used in patients with chronic HBV infection, resulting in a substantial decrease in HBsAg titers (45) . Interestingly, combination therapy with interferon-α successfully cleared HBsAg. Therefore, combined use with HBV nucleos(t)ide analogs can be definitely envisaged (Figure 2) . It is important to emphasize that a potentially dangerous effect of immune complex formation following intravenous injection of monoclonal or polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies in HBsAg positive mice, chimpanzees and human subjects has so far not been convincingly demonstrated. Indeed, no renal complications or immune complex disease has been described in this setting. Similarly, no untoward effects were reported in HBV-infected individuals receiving high doses of polyclonal hepatitis B immunoglobulin (46) . It is anyway important, in principle, that anti-HBs humAbs be administered in molar excess to ensure the presence of excess uncomplexed humAbs for effective neutralization and elimination of circulating HBV.

Cooperation between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity is required for efficient elimination of pathogens. To this end, antiviral humAbs can be exploited to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which takes place via specific receptors recognizing the Fc fragment of IgGs (FcγRs) expressed on the membrane of several cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. The FcγR family includes several classes of receptors that show different affinity for the Fc fragment. One of these, the low affinity FcγRIII (CD16), is the most potent activating receptor of NK cells mediating ADCC (47) . To evaluate the potential to mediate ADCC, an assay has been developed to measure the ability of antiviral IgG triggering activation of cells expressing Fcγ receptors (48) . This is obtained by the interaction of chimeric Fcγ receptors with immune complexes formed on the surface of IgG-coated target cells resulting in FcγR-mediated activation, FIGURE 2 | Combined or sequential treatment of chronic HBV infection with HBsAg-specific humAbs and nucleos(t)ide analogs. Patients with chronic HBV infection (gray) can be treated with HBs-humAbs to rescue T and B cell exhaustion caused by HBV envelope proteins, either sequentially or in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs). Reconstitution of HBV-specific adaptive immunity would ultimately increase NUC efficacy and result in viral clearance (green). T-eff, T effector cells.

which makes use of IL-2 secretion by a mouse hybridoma as a surrogate readout. It is thus possible to screen different humAbs for their potential to efficiently mediate ADCC. Whether ADCC plays a role in the setting of HBV infection is presently unclear, but would also depend on the ability of NK cells and other innate lymphoid cells to perform this function, as well as on the affinity of FcγRIII (CD16). Of note, studies using a mAb targeting a linear epitope (aa 119-125 of HBsAg on the first loop N-terminus located at the major hydrophilic region of HBsAg) promoted HBV clearance and blockade of viral infection (49) . Even more interestingly, other humAbs targeting the NTCP-binding site of preS1 (50) were able to reduce HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in murine models of established HBV infection and efficiently mediated ADCC, which was abolished when these antibodies were engineered in the Fc to prevent binding to FcγRs.

The findings discussed above suggest that humAbs targeting HBV envelope epitopes might indeed have a potential for combination therapies in chronically infected individuals. Phase I clinical trials are therefore eagerly awaited in this setting.

Efficacy of Antiviral Drugs against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is one of the most common infectious agents affecting cats worldwide .FIV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share many properties: both are lifelong persistent lentiviruses that are similar genetically and morphologically and both viruses propagate in T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and neural cells. Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high in vitro susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of studies on antiviral treatment of FIV, focusing on commercially available compounds for human or animal use.","DNA or RNA strands, but because of small differences in the molecular structure, chain termination results or nonfunctional nucleic acids are produced [5, 8, 9] . NARTIs are accepted as false substrates by viral enzymes as well as by cellular enzymes, which is the main reason for their toxicity [10] .

Zidovudine (3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine, AZT) was first synthesized in the 1960s [11] as a potential anticancer drug. In 1985 it was shown to be effective against HIV [12] and became the first drug approved for treatment of HIV infection [13] .

The anti-FIV activity of zidovudine has been assessed in numerous in vitro studies in different cell systems [14, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The first in vitro study was carried out in 1989, when North and coworkers showed that zidovudine inhibited FIV replication in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The susceptibility of FIV to zidovudine was similar to that of HIV [27] . There is evidence that FIV can become resistant to nucleoside analogues, as is the case in HIV. Zidovudine-resistant FIV mutants can arise after only six months of use, and a single-point mutation in the FIV gene is responsible for resistance [10] .

In vivo, zidovudine can reduce plasma viral load, improve the immunologic and clinical status of FIV-infected cats, increase quality of life, and prolong life expectancy [16] . In placebo-controlled trials, zidovudine improved stomatitis and increased the CD4/CD8 ratio in naturally FIV-infected cats. In some cats with FIV-associated neurologic signs, marked improvement was reported within the first days of therapy [28, 29] .

Zidovudine not only inhibits RT, but also cellular polymerases, and this can lead to bone marrow suppression. Regular blood cell counts are necessary during zidovudine treatment because non-regenerative anemia is a common side effect [28] . Cats with bone marrow suppression should not be treated with zidovudine. Most FIV-infected cats treated with zidovudine for as long as two years tolerated the drug well. The hematocrit can decline within three weeks of initiating treatment to approximately 50% of baseline but increases afterwards in most cases, even without discontinuation of treatment. If the hematocrit drops below 20%, discontinuation of treatment is recommended, and anemia usually resolves within a few days. Other side effects in cats, including vomiting or anorexia, are rare [28] .

Stavudine (2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine, d4T) is another drug effective against HIV. It was approved for treatment of HIV infection in 1994, but in recent years has been replaced in most multi-drug treatment protocols by compounds with fewer side effects [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Stavudine is active against FIV in vitro [18] [19] [20] 23, 26, 35, 36] . Mutants of FIV that are resistant to stavudine and cross-resistant to several other antivirals, including zidovudine, have been detected. Resistance is caused by a single-point mutation in the RT-encoding region of the pol gene [26] . No in vivo data in FIV-infected cats have been published.

Didanosine (2′,3′-dideoxyinosine, ddl) was shown to be active against HIV in 1986 [37]. In the United States, it was the second drug to be approved for treatment of HIV and has been on the market since 1991 [5] .

Didanosine is active against FIV in vitro [14, 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] 26, 38] . In one experimental in vivo study, FIV replication was significantly suppressed in animals treated with didanosine, but treatment contributed to the development of antiretroviral toxic neuropathy [39].

Lamivudine (2R,cis-4-amino-l-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one, 3TC) is also an anti-HIV drug, approved in 1995 [40] .

Lamivudine is active against FIV in vitro [3, 20, 21, 23, 38, 41] . A combination of zidovudine and lamivudine had synergistic anti-FIV activities in cell cultures [41] . FIV mutants resistant to lamivudine and containing a point mutation in the RT gene were selected in vitro and showed cross resistance to zidovudine [23] .

In one in vivo study, experimentally FIV-infected cats were treated with a high-dose zidovudine/ lamivudine combination, which protected some cats from infection when treatment was started before virus inoculation. However, zidovudine/lamivudine treatment showed no anti-FIV activity in chronically infected cats. Severe side effects, including fever, anorexia, and marked hematologic changes, were observed in some of the cats with this high-dose dual-drug treatment [41] . Thus, high-dose lamivudine treatment alone, or in combination with zidovudine, is not recommended in naturally FIV-infected cats.

Emtricitabine (2',3'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine, FTC) is structurally similar to lamivudine and was licensed by the FDA in 2003 [40] . In vitro, antiviral efficacy has been demonstrated against FIV [17, [20] [21] [22] , but to date there have been no in vivo studies in FIV-infected cats.

Abacavir ((1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol, ABC) was shown to be active against HIV in 1986 and belongs to the FDA-approved anti-HIV compounds [40] . Abacavir is active against FIV in vitro, but had higher levels of cytotoxicity than other compounds, such as didanosine and amdoxovir [16, 20] . There are no in vivo studies of this drug in FIV-infected cats.

Similar to NARTIs, NtARTIs also interact with the catalytic site of RT and are incorporated into the elongating proviral DNA strand, causing chain termination [5, 42] . They compete with natural nucleotides and therefore function as competitive substrate inhibitors. However, in contrast to NARTIs, NtARTIs already contain one phosphate group and thus need only two intracellular phosphorylation steps for conversion to their active forms because the first and often rate-limiting phosphorylation step is unnecessary [5, 42, 43 ].

Adefovir (2-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-ethoxy-methyl-phosphonic acid, PMEA) is active against herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), and retroviruses [44] . Adefovir is not licensed as an HIV drug, but is currently available as an oral formulation (bis-POM PMEA) approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Adefovir belongs to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, in which the alkyl side chain of purines and pyrimidines is linked to a modified phosphate moiety and a C-P phosphonate linkage replaces the normal O5′-P phosphate linkage [43, 45] . This phosphonate bond is not hydrolysable, which makes it more difficult to cleave off these compounds once they have been incorporated at the 3′-terminal end of the elongating proviral DNA strand [5] . Adefovir inhibits FIV replication in vitro [46] .

Several studies have investigated the efficacy of adefovir in either experimentally and naturally FIV-infected cats [47, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . A few of those studies showed some efficacy, but also reported severe side effects, mainly non-regenerative anemia. In a recent study, adefovir was administered to FIV-infected cats in a six-week placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial; ten cats received adefovir (10 mg/kg SC twice weekly) and ten cats received placebo. There was no decrease in proviral or viral loads in treated cats, and treated cats developed a progressive, sometimes life-threatening anemia, which is a common adverse effect of NtARTIs [53] . This shows that results obtained in experimental studies cannot always be applied to a field situation and emphasizes the importance of controlled clinical field trials. Based on the lack of efficacy in the recent placebo-controlled field trial and the side effects, adefovir cannot be recommended for treatment of FIV-infected cats.

Currently, the only approved NtARTi for the treatment of HIV infection is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the prodrug of tenofovir ((R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine, (R)-PMPA), which is also a member of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [43, 45] . The antiviral spectrum of tenofovir (2R-1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-propan-2-yl-oxy-methyl-phosphonic acid, PMPA) is narrower than that of adefovir; it does not encompass herpesviruses, but is confined to hepadna-and retroviruses [44] . Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has become one of the most commonly used drugs in HIV therapy since its licensing in 2001 [5, 9] .

Tenofovir is effective against FIV in vitro [25, 45] , and there is some evidence that tenovovir might have greater anti-FIV efficacy with less cytotoxicity than other antiretroviral compounds, including adefovir [45, 54] . However, in vivo studies are lacking and should be a focus of future research.

Most of the NNRTIs are highly specific for HIV-1 and are not active against other retroviruses, including HIV-2 and FIV [7, 42] . Unlike NARTIs and NtARTIs, which bind to the catalytic site of RT, non-nucleoside RT inhibitors interact with an allosteric site of the enzyme [5] and are not incorporated into the proviral DNA strand [42] . They are classified as non-competitive inhibitors of RT and do not require intracellular activation for inhibition of the enzyme [8, 42] . NNRTIs are a group of structurally diverse compounds that all bind a single site of the RT [55] . The interaction with the allosteric site which is located in close proximity to the catalytic site, leads to a number of conformational changes of the RT [55, 56] . Among other effects, these changes cause a reduction in the interaction between the DNA primer and the polymerase domain of the enzyme and thus, inhibit virus replication [55, 56] .

Three of the FDA-approved NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz) have been shown not to be effective against FIV in vitro [40, 57] . In vivo studies have not been performed, presumably because of the lack of in vitro efficacy [7, 57] . Only one old NNRTI, suramin, with a broad antiviral spectrum has been used in veterinary medicine. A major breakthrough in the treatment of FIV would be the discovery of more NNRTIs with activity against FIV RT.

Suramin (1-(3-benzamido-4-methylbenzamido)-naphthalene 4,6,8-trisulfonic acid sym-3′-urea sodium salt), a sulfated naphthylamine and trypan red derivative, is one of the oldest known antimicrobial agents. It has been used as an antitrypanosomal agent and for the treatment of some tumors, such as prostate cancer [58] . It also has an inhibitory effect on the RT activity of retroviruses and has also been used in humans with HIV infection [59] . Suramin inhibits RT by interacting with the template-primer binding site of the enzyme. Thus, it competitively binds to the primer binding site (without being a nucleoside analogue) and inhibits the template-primer binding that is necessary for DNA elongation. Suramin can therefore be classified as an NNRTI [60] .

Suramin is effective against feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in vivo [61, 62] , and thus, could potentially be active against FIV, although this has not been investigated.

Suramin is associated with a significant number of severe side effects in humans, such as nausea and anaphylactic shock as immediate reactions during administration and peripheral neuritis leading to palmar-plantar hyperesthesia, photophobia, skin reactions, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and destruction of the adrenal cortex as later side effects [58, 59, [63] [64] [65] . In cats with FeLV infection, the major adverse effects of suramin were transient vomiting and anorexia [61] .

Nucleotide synthesis inhibitors prevent synthesis of nucleotides through various mechanisms. They have a broad spectrum of activity but are associated with marked toxicity mainly because they are non-selective and therefore also interfere with normal cellular nucleotide synthesis. Some, for instance foscarnet, interfere with the exchange of pyrophosphate from deoxynucleoside triphosphate during viral replication by binding to RT or DNA polymerase, thereby preventing nucleotide synthesis [66] . Others, such as ribavirin, inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase after intracellular phosphorylation, which in turn leads to inhibition of guanosine monophosphate.

Foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid, PFA) has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses, including retroviruses. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV-associated cytomegalo and herpes simplex virus infections in humans [67] . Foscarnet is usually administered intravenously by continuous intravenous infusion because of its short half-life, which has also been demonstrated in cats [68] . Oral administration of the drug is possible but can result in irritation of mucous membranes and oral bleeding. Foscarnet has many side effects, including nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression, in both humans and cats. It also is toxic to epithelial cells and mucous membranes, resulting in gastrointestinal side effects and genital epithelium ulceration. In addition, it chelates various cations, which can lead to hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia [69, 70] .

In vitro, foscarnet has been shown to be active against FIV, but foscarnet-resistant FIV strains can develop [14] . No in vivo studies in FIV-infected cats have been carried out, likely because of the severe side effects and necessity for continuous intravenous administration of the drug.

Ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1 H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide, RTCA) has marked in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses [71] . Systemic administration of ribavirin is limited in cats because of side effects [72] . Sequestration of ribavirin within erythrocytes results in hemolysis, even when low doses of the drug are used [73, 74] . In addition, there is a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes, resulting in thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. With prolonged ribavirin treatment or at higher doses, the production of erythrocytes and neutrophils also is suppressed. Ribavirin also can induce hepatic toxicity. An attempt to decrease the toxicity of ribavirin by incorporating it into lecithin-containing liposomes and administering it at lower doses was not successful [75] .

Ribavirin is active against many viruses in vitro, including FIV [23, 76] . Therapeutic concentrations are difficult to achieve in vivo because of toxicity [74] . To date, the efficacy of ribavirin has not been investigated in FIV-infected cats.

Receptor homologues/antagonists bind to the virus or to the cellular receptor, leading to inhibition of viral cell-surface binding. Most of the receptor homologues/antagonists are highly selective for HIV and not useful in veterinary medicine. An exception is the class of antiviral compounds called bicyclams, which have been used in cats with FIV infection. Bicyclams act as potent and selective CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonists [77, 78] . Chemokine receptors belong to the group of seven transmembrane-proteins that enable signal transmission through rapid influx of calcium into the cell. They are essential co-receptors for HIV as well as for FIV during infection of CD4+ lymphocytes [79, 80] . By binding to CXCR4, bicyclams prevent interaction of CXCR4 with other ligands, thereby inhibiting the entry of HIV or FIV into the cell [81] [82] [83] .

(1,1′-(1,4-phenylenbismethylene)-bis(1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)-octachlo-ride dehydrate, AMD3100) is the bicyclam prototype compound. It is not marketed as an anti-HIV drug, but is used in humans for stem cell mobilization [84] .

Plerixafor is active against FIV in vitro [82] . In a placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial, treatment of naturally FIV-infected cats with plerixafor resulted in a significant decrease in proviral load in treated cats when compared to the placebo group. There was a concomitant decrease in serum magnesium levels, which did not produce any clinical consequences. Development of resistance of FIV isolates to plerixafor did not occur during treatment [53] . In cats, plerixafor is administered at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h. Monitoring of magnesium and calcium levels should be performed at regular intervals during treatment [53] . Further studies investigating the potential of this promising drug are needed.

Protease inhibitors (PI) specifically bind to the active site of the protease and therefore prevent viral replication. Several PIs have been used for successful treatment of HIV. Nevertheless, side effects and development of viral resistance were found during treatment, and therefore additional compounds that bind to sites other than the active site of the protease have been developed [85] [86] [87] .

Tipranavir (N-[3-[(1R)-1-[(2R)-6-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-(2-phenylethyl)-2-propyl-3H-pyran-5-yl]propy l]phenyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-sulfonamid) was approved in 2005, and is used as an anti-HIV compound. The drug was shown to be active against FIV in vitro.Tipranavir completely prevented FIV replication [85, 86] . No studies in FIV-infected cats exist so far, and further studies are needed to investigate the potential of tipranavir in naturally infected cats.

The drug was shown to be active against FIV in vitro but did not prevent FIV replication completely [85] . There are no in vivo studies in FIV-infected cats. 

The enzyme integrase catalyzes strand transfer (3′-end joining), which inserts both viral DNA ends into a host cell chromosome during proviral DNA integration [5, 88] . Once integrated, the provirus persists in the host cell genome and functions as a template for replication of the viral genome, leading to the formation of new viruses [89] . The high degree of conservation of integrase-active sites across many retroviruses suggests that FIV might also be sensitive to integrase inhibitors [90] . Integrase inhibitors act through inhibition of integration of the proviral DNA that is produced by reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome [91] .

Raltegravir is used as an anti-HIV compound. The drug was shown to be active against FIV in vitro [92] , but FIV was less susceptible to raltegravir than HIV [92] .

No studies in FIV-infected cats exist so far. Although there are no in vivo studies on the efficacy of raltegravir in FIV-infected cats, the drug recently was shown to be effective against FeLV and was safe in cats [93] .

Interferons (IFNs) are polypeptide molecules with various biological functions [94] . They play an important role in mediating antiviral and antigrowth responses and in immune response modulation [95] . They can be divided into type I and type II IFNs, both of which have antiviral properties. Type I IFNs, including IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω, are produced by virus-infected cells [94, 96] , whereas type II IFN, consisting of only IFN-γ, is produced by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in response to recognition of virus-infected cells [97] . IFNs act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion [98] inducing an anti-viral state in non-infected cells. IFNs bind to specific cell surface receptors and result in the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. The products of these genes are proteins with potent anti-viral properties that interfere with various stages of viral replication [98] . Several studies suggest that retroviral protein synthesis is not affected by IFNs and therefore conclude that the antiviral activity of IFNs is mainly related to interference with later stages of the viral replication cycle such as virion assembly and release [94, 99] . Interferons also trigger virus-infected cells to undergo apoptosis by activating gene expression for apoptosis [97, 99] , which prevents the spread of virus from infected cells and aids in the clearance of virus infection [97] . Human IFNs have been manufactured by recombinant DNA technology and are available commercially. Recombinant feline IFN-ω is on the market in Japan, Australia, and many European countries and is licensed for use in cats and dogs.

Recombinant human interferon-α (rHuIFN-α) has antiviral and immune-modulatory activity. IFN-α is active against many DNA and RNA viruses [98] . There are two common treatment regimens for use of rHuIFN-α in cats: SC injection (10 4 to 10 6 U/kg every 24 h) or oral application (1 to 50 U/kg every 24 h).

Human IFN-α becomes ineffective after three to seven weeks of parenteral use in cats because of the production of neutralizing antibodies [100] . Anti-IFN-α antibody production does not occur with oral administration of IFN-α and therefore this route allows for a longer period of treatment. IFN-α is inactivated by gastric acid and destroyed by trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes in the duodenum [101] , which means that direct antiviral effects are unlikely after oral application. However, oral IFN-α appears to have immuno-modulatory activity, because it can stimulate local lymphoid tissue. The release of cytokines by lymphatic cells in the oropharyngeal area triggers a cascade of immunologic responses with systemic effects [102] [103] [104] .

RHuIFN-α has been shown to be active against FIV in vitro [105] . Although frequently used in the field for treating FIV-infected cats, controlled studies evaluating the effect of parenteral administration of rHuIFN-α in FIV-infected cats have not been conducted.

Use of oral rHuIFN-α in 24 ill, naturally FIV-infected cats (50 U/kg applied to the oral mucosa daily for seven days on alternating weeks for six months, followed by a two-month break, and then repetition of the six-month treatment) resulted in improvement of clinical signs (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infections) in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study [106] . However, proviral and viral loads were not monitored during thiat study and therefore it is impossible to conclude whether treatment with rHuIFN-α had indeed an effect on FIV, or rather on secondary infections.

Recombinant feline interferon-ω (rFeIFN-ω), the corresponding feline interferon, is licensed for use in veterinary medicine in Japan, Australia, and some European countries. It can be used in cats for long periods without antibody development, and no major severe side effects have been reported [107] .

IFN-ω inhibits FIV replication in vitro [105] . One placebo-controlled, multicenter study that investigated the effect of parenteral rFeIFN-ω against FIV infection in 62 naturally FIV-infected cats (treated with 10 6 U/kg SC q 24 h on five consecutive days) did not find a difference in the survival rate in treated cats. However, some improvement in clinical scores, including eight categories of clinical signs (rectal temperature, behavior, appetite, thirst, dehydration, mucous membrane appearance, stomatitis, and death) as well as improvement in laboratory abnormalities (leukopenia, leukocytosis, and anemia) occured [107] . In another study, which evaluated naturally FIV-infected cats housed in a shelter, some clinical improvement was observed after parenteral rFeIFN-ω (10 6 U/kg SC q 24 h on FIVe consecutive days for three cycles), but this study lacked a placebo control. In that same study, hematologic values remained within reference intervals, and there were no biochemical abnormalities associated with rFeIFN-ω treatment [96] .

A recent study evaluated the use of oral administration of rFeIFN-ω for the treatment of eleven client-owned, naturally FIV-infected cats with clinical signs [108] . The treatment protocol was 10 5 U/cat PO q 24 h for 90 consecutive days, administered by the cats' owners. A historical retrospective group was used as a control for comparison (10 6 U/kg SC q 24 h on five consecutive days for three cycles), but a placebo group was not included. Treatment with oral rFeIFN-ω resulted in a significant improvement in clinical scores (e.g., oral lesions, coat appearance, body condition score, and ocular discharge) after treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference between the SC historical control group and the PO group, suggesting that oral administration of rFeIFN-ω might be a viable and less expensive alternative [109] . In a recently published study that assessed viremia, provirus load, and blood cytokine profile in naturally FIV-infected cats treated with oral rFeIFN-ω (10 5 U/cat PO q 24 h for 90 days) or with subcutaneous rFeIFN-ω (10 6 U/cat SC q 24 h for 5 consecutive days in three courses), no change in the level of viremia or in most cytokine levels was found; a placebo control group was not included [109] . The fact that virus load remained unchanged but some clinical improvement was observed in earlier studies suggests that rFeIFN-ω has an effect on secondary infections rather than on FIV itself [94] . As there are major differences in outcomes of the different studies on feline IFN-ω in FIV-infected cats. Thus, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn without additional randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded studies that include a sufficiently high number of naturally FIV-infected cats.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of antiviral compounds for the treatment of FIV in cats has been generally poor. The duration of treatment in many clinical trials was relatively short and might have been inadequate for infections with a long clinical course. In addition, it is difficult to compare treatment results of cats infected experimentally and kept under laboratory conditions and pet cats infected with field strains of FIV. Therefore, further well-designed double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials using antiviral drugs in naturally FIV-infected cats are needed to determine the efficacy and side effects of different antiviral compounds.

International Journal of Nanomedicine Dovepress Antiviral efficacy of nanoparticulate vacuolar ATPase inhibitors against influenza virus infection,"Influenza virus infections are a major public health concern worldwide. Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. Methods: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs' anti-influenza applicability. Results: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza.","Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and can be categorized into four major types: A, B, C, and D. 1,2 Influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people cause seasonal flu epidemics each year. Influenza viruses inflict millions of infection cases in human and animals every year, and effective antivirals are an essential countermeasure against the disease. Amantadine is the first synthetic compound that inhibits influenza virus replication; the compound and its derivatives inhibit matrix-2 ion channels to block the migration of H + ions into the interior of the virus particles, a process critical for virus uncoating to occur. 3 In recent years, however, influenza virus resistance to these compounds has been widely reported. 4, 5 Another class of antiviral agent is neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, which include oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. These antiviral agents inhibit viral NA activity, which plays an important role in early influenza infection of the human airway epithelium and in virus budding. 6 While oseltamivir is currently the most common commercial anti-influenza drug, resistance against NA inhibitors has been observed. 5, 7 On the contrary, several genome-wide screens have identified host factors essential for influenza virus replication. [8] [9] [10] As an alternative to the aforementioned pathogen-targeted antivirals, growing efforts are devoted to blocking or promoting host factors to fight influenza viruses. 11 By modulating host factors involved in viral replications, these host-targeted antiviral strategies may be less susceptible to strain variations and mutations as they do not exert a selective pressure on the target pathogen.

Among host factors that can be targeted for antiviral treatments, vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are a promising target for intercepting virus entry into host cells. V-ATPases are ubiquitous proton pumps located in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells. 12 Among viral threats such as influenza viruses, flaviviruses, vaccinia viruses, bornaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and coronaviruses, V-ATPase-mediated endosomal acidification is an essential cellular process for viral entry. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Inhibition of V-ATPase-mediated endosomal acidification may thus pave ways to new antiviral treatments with broad applicability and low susceptibility to drug-resistant mutation. Several V-ATPase inhibitors have been studied, among which plecomacrolide bafilomycin is the first discovered and perhaps the most notable example. 18 While these compounds have shown antiviral potentials, their clinical application is thwarted by toxicity concerns. [19] [20] [21] In addition, V-ATPase inhibitors are often poorly water soluble, which presents further drug delivery challenges. Previously, we showed that diphyllin, a new class of the V-ATPase inhibitor, 12 is effective in blocking influenza virus infection, 22 and its nanoformulation showed improved safety and effectiveness in inhibiting the feline coronavirus. 23 Toward improving V-ATPase inhibitors for influenza treatment, we herein prepare diphyllin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles comprised of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PEG-PLGA) and examined its efficacy against influenza virus in vitro and in vivo. In parallel, we assessed the applicability of nanoparticle-mediated delivery to the commonly studied bafilomycin. The particular nanocarrier was chosen as PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticles that have been broadly adopted for enhancing the delivery of hydrophobic drugs. 24 The biodegradable polymer is also widely used in FDA-approved products and is therefore readily translatable. 25 The material has also been shown to induce little innate immune activation. 26 In this study, the physicochemical properties and drug release kinetics of both diphyllin and bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles were examined. Cellular uptake of the nanoparticles was assessed in two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines, including MH-S and ARPE-19 (adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line- 19) . We further demonstrated that the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors were less cytotoxic than the free drug compounds and reduced influenza viral infection in vitro. Using diphyllin nanoparticles, we also showed that the host-targeted treatment can be applied to multiple strains of influenza viruses and successfully reduced disease severity in a mouse model of influenza virus infection, highlighting the potential of nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for antiviral development.

MDCK (Madin -Darby canine kidney) cells were maintained in the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). MH-S (murine alveolar macrophages [AMs]) cells were maintained in ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 0.05 mM, FBS to a final concentration of 10%, and 1% PSA. For influenza virus infection in MDCK and MH-S cells, infection medium (RPMI containing 0.75% BSA, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% PSA, and 2 µg/mL L-1-p-Tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin) was used. ARPE-19 cells were maintained in the DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSA. All the cells were purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC) (Hsinchu, Taiwan) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . All the reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) was kindly provided by Professor Shin-Ru Shih in Chang Gung University. A/HKx31(H3N2) was kindly provided by Professor Hung-Chih Yang in National Taiwan University. Viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-dayold embryonated chicken eggs. The viral titer was determined as below.

Diphyllin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) or bafilomycin (LC Laboratory, Woburn, MA, USA) was encapsulated into a PEG-functionalized PLGA nanoparticle using an oil-in-water emulsion technique. Briefly, 0.5 mg of diphyllin or bafilomycin was dissolved with 20 mg of PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers (Sigma #764760) in 1 mL of chloroform (Honeywell International Inc., Morris Plains, NJ, USA). The solution was subsequently added to 5 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and dispersed using a probe sonicator for 1 minute 30 seconds with 50% power to form the single emulsion. Following the sonication, the emulsion was placed inside a fume hood under gentle stirring (180-220 rpm) to 

Vacuolar ATPase-inhibiting anti-influenza nanoparticles evaporate the chloroform. Following 3 hours of solvent evaporation, the resulting nanoparticles were collected and washed in 10 mL of the phosphate buffer under ultracentrifugation 60,000 g, 25 minutes. Then, the nanoparticles were resuspended in 10% sucrose for subsequent characterization. Empty PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were also prepared as a control for this study. For preparing fluorescently labeled nanoparticles, 0.01 mg of a DiD fluorescent dye (1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-Tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-Chlorobenzenesulfonate Salt) (633 nm/647 nm) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; #D7757) was added to the solvent phase before the single emulsion process.

For TEM observation, negative staining was applied. First, 10 µL nanoparticles was added to glow-discharged grid and the droplet was placed on the grid for 30 seconds. Then, 10 drops of ddH 2 O was applied to the grid to wash away the excessive nanoparticles. Subsequently, the grid was stained with 10 µL of 1% uranyl acetate for 30 seconds and the staining was subsequently removed by wicking with a piece of filter paper. Nanoparticle size and zeta potential were determined by DLS using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each measurement was made with 1 mL of the nanoparticles at 1 mg/mL in water in a folded capillary zeta cell (Malvern Panalytical, DTS1070).

The content of diphyllin or bafilomycin in the PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was quantified by HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA; 1,100 series). Briefly, 200 µL of nanoparticles loaded with diphyllin or bafilomycin was dissolved with 800 µL of acetone, which was then air-dried at 60°C. The samples were then dissolved in mobile phase solvent (diphyllin: 40% acetonitrile/bafilomycin: 87% acetonitrile) and filtered prior to HPLC. Ascentis C18 column was equipped in mobile phase. The optimal detection wavelength was 254 nm, and the column temperature was 25°C. Serially diluted samples of diphyllin (0.125, 0.03125, 0.0078125, and 0.001953125 mg/mL) or bafilomycin (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, and 0.03125 mg/mL) dissolved in the mobile phase solvent were prepared as standards for the HPLC analysis.

The drug release kinetics were determined in either phosphate buffer (1.16 mM Na 2 HPO4, 38.9 mM NaH 2 PO4, pH 7.4) or acetate buffer (0.33% acetate acid, 1.31% sodium acetate, pH 5.0). A set of dialysis tubes (Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Device) were loaded with 50 µL drug-loaded nanoparticles containing 0.05 mg of diphyllin or bafilomycin. The tubes were then placed in a tank of phosphate buffer or acetate buffer. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were harvested from the dialysis tubes at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 23 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. The nanoparticle samples were then dissolved with acetone, and the drug contents were analyzed by HPLC. cellular uptake studies MH-S cells and ARPE-19 cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides (3×10 4 /well) 1 day prior to the experiment. These cells were treated with DiD-labeled diphyllin or bafilomycin nanoparticles (1 mg/mL) in the culture media. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, culture supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with PBS buffer. Untreated cells were used as a control. The cells were fixed using 10% formalin (V/V) in water. Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI, and fluorescence microscopy (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; IX83) was used to examine cellular uptake of the fluorescent nanoparticles.

In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of free drugs and drug-loaded nanoparticles For evaluating 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), MH-S cells were grown on a 96-well clear polystyrene microplate at a density of 20,000 cells per well 1 day prior to the experiment. Free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles were twofold serially diluted in cell media and added to the cell monolayer in four replicates. After 72 hours of incubation, 5 µL of alamarBlue reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well to evaluate the cellular viability. Absorbance values were measured at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 610 nm. The CC 50 of free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles was analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

The CPE inhibition assay was used to determine the IC 50 of free drug or drug-loaded nanoparticles (the concentration of drug showed 50% inhibition of virus-induced CPE) against influenza virus H1N1. Briefly, MH-S cells were seeded on 96-well microplates (10,000 cells/well) 1 day before the experiment. Free drug or drug-loaded nanoparticles in infection medium were added to MH-S cells 1 hour before infection. After 1 hour of incubation, cells were infected with influenza virus H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After infection, viruses were removed and the free drug or drug-loaded nanoparticles in cell medium were added back to the cells. After 24 hours, cellular viability was examined by an alamarBlue assay. The IC 50 of free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles were determined using Prism (GraphPad).

To evaluate the activity of free drug or drug nanoparticles in blocking the viral replication, MH-S cell cultures were used. The cells were pretreated 1 hour with free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles and then infected with influenza virus (H1N1, MOI=1; H3N2, MOI=5) for 1 hour. After infection, viruses were removed and the cells were washed. Subsequently, fresh cell media containing drug-loaded nanoparticles were added to the cells. After 24 hours of incubation, the supernatant was harvested to assess the viral titer.

Anti-influenza efficacy study was performed in mice. Groups of six 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taipei, Taiwan. Mice were infected with a nonlethal dose [100,000 PFU (plaque-forming unit), equal to 0.5 LD 50 ] or a lethal dose (250,000 PFU, equal to 1.3 LD 50 ) of influenza H1N1 virus via intranasal administration under light anesthesia with Zoletil 50 (18.75 mg/kg). Right after the virus infection, mice were intravenously injected with diphyllin nanoparticles containing 10 µg of diphyllin for 1 or 3 days. Mice receiving empty PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were set as a control group. Following the virus infection, mice were monitored daily for weight change and survival. For the nonlethal dose infection experiment, two mice of each group were sacrificed on day 5 postviral infection. Lungs of the mice were harvested and homogenated in the infection medium, and the viral load was determined by the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) described below. Animal experiments in this study were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the National Taiwan University (Approval number: NTU105-EL-00181).

For tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assays, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well microplates (2×10 4 cells/well) 1 day before the experiment. First, the growth media were removed and the cells were washed with PBS buffer. The samples were tenfold serially diluted with infection medium, and 100 µL of the diluted samples was added to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After the infection, media were removed and the cells were washed. Subsequently, 100 µL of the fresh virus media was added into each well. After 72 hours of incubation, the supernatant was harvested to perform the direct hemagglutination assay spot assay with 1% chicken RBCs, and the viral titers were determined with the Reed and Muench method. 27 For plaque assays, MDCK cells were seeded in a 6-well plate to obtain 80% confluency (8×10 5 cells/well) 1 day before experiments. First, the growth medium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS buffer. The samples were tenfold serially diluted with infection medium, and 200 µL of the diluted samples was added to the cells and then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour under gentle shaking. After the infection, culture media were removed and cells were washed with PBS. Two milliliters of 0.3% agarose in infection medium was then added to each well. After 72 hours of incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes. The agarose overlay was removed with running water. The cells were stained with 1% crystal violet at room temperature for 15 minutes. Once dry, the viral plaques were counted, and the viral titers were determined. For viral RNA quantification in the lung of the mice, a qRT-PCR was performed as previously described 28 with some modifications. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted using a viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen NV, Venlo, the Netherlands) following manufacturer's instructions. For qPCR, the 20 µL reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 500 nM of primers M1-F and primer M1-R, and 250 nM of FAM-labeled probe (Integrated DNA Technologies), 10 µL of 2× PrimeTime Gene Expression MasterMix (Integrated DNA Technologies), and 2 µL of cDNA. The cycling protocol in a thermal cycler consisted of 3 minutes of preheating at 95°C and followed by 45 cycles of 15 seconds of denaturation at 95°C, 1 minute of primer annealing and extension at 60°C (CFX Connect, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Two microliters of plasmid DNA containing various copy numbers of the matrix protein gene of influenza virus was used for standard curve construction in qRT-PCR for viral load quantification. Two replicates were performed for each samples or standards.

Data were analyzed by unpaired t-test or ANOVA followed by the Dunnett's multiple comparison tests using Prism (Graph-Pad). P-value ,0.05 is considered statistically significant. 

The composition of diphyllin nanoparticles is illustrated in Figure 1A . Using DLS, the diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles in this study showed a Z-average diameter of 178 nm ( Figure 1B) . The resulting diphyllin nanoparticles showed a uniformly spherical shape as visualized by TEM ( Figure 1C ). The quantification of diphyllin loading in PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was determined by HPLC. The standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of diphyllin (0.125, 0.03125, 0.0078125, and 0.001953125 mg/mL) that separately corresponded to each area value 2,140.27, 587.06, 154.80, and 35.19 (mAU*second) ( Figure S1A ) and the peak detection of diphyllin appeared at ~9.9 minutes ( Figure 1D ). With the reference of standard curve, the content of diphyllin in nanoparticles for each batch was determined. In this study, the averaged loading efficiency of diphyllin was 42%.

The schematic presentation of bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles is illustrated in Figure 1E . Using DLS, the bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles used in this study had a Z-average diameter of 197 nm ( Figure 1F ). The resulting bafilomcycin-loaded nanoparticles showed a uniformly spherical shape as visualized by TEM ( Figure 1G ). The quantification of bafilomycin loading in PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was determined by HPLC. The standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of bafilomycin (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, and 0.03125 mg/mL) that separately corresponded to each area value 7,270.52, 3,652.66, 1,751.47, 901.46, and 421.81 (mAU*second) ( Figure S1B ). The peak detection of bafilomycin appeared at ~5.5 minutes ( Figure 1H ). With the reference of standard curve, the content of bafilomycin in nanoparticles for each batch was determined. In this study, the loading efficiency of bafilomycin was ~100%. Both nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors showed similar physicochemical properties. Interestingly, bafilomycin encapsulation was much more efficient than diphyllin, which may be attributed to bafilomycin's lower water solubility.

This drug release study was performed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and acetate buffer (pH 5.0) to simulate the extracellular and endosomal condition, respectively. In diphyllin nanoparticles, little diphyllin was released from the nanoparticles in the first 6 hours. After 23 hours, 22% of the diphyllin was released in the acidic buffer and 15% of diphyllin was released in the phosphate buffer. After 72 hours, 64% of diphyllin was released in the acidic buffer and 54% of diphyllin was released in the phosphate buffer (Figure 2A) . Overall, diphyllin release from the nanoparticles was largely similar between the two pH values during the observation period. For bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles, 20% of bafilomycin was released in the acidic buffer and 12% of bafilomycin was released in the phosphate buffer in the first 6 hours. After 23 hours, 36% of bafilomycin was released in the acidic buffer and 24% of bafilomycin was released in the phosphate buffer. After 72 hours, 55% of bafilomycin was released in the acidic buffer and 43% of bafilomycin was released in the phosphate buffer ( Figure 2B ). Bafilomycin release was accelerated in pH 5.0 compared with pH 7.4 overall. Both diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles exhibited sustained drug release profiles for over 72 hours. 

To assess the safety of the drug-loaded nanoparticles, a standard alamarBlue assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of free drugs and drug-loaded nanoparticles in MH-S cells. Following a 3-day incubation, the CC 50 values of free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles were 12.5 µM and 21.89 µM, respectively ( Figure 4A ). The improved safety Figure 4B ). These results indicate improved safety achieved by the nanoparticulate diphyllin and bafilomycin, which may facilitate sustained release and enhance drug localization in the endolysosomal compartment for reduced side effects.

The IC 50 of free drug and drug-loaded against influenza virus H1N1 was determined by the CPE inhibition assay in MH-S cells. The results showed that the IC 50 of free diphyllin was 8.149 µM, whereas that of the diphyllin nanoparticles was 4.640 µM ( Figure 4C ), demonstrating improved antiviral activity with the nanoformulation. Calculation of therapeutic index (TI = CC 50 /IC 50 ) yielded values of 1.53 and 4.72 for the free diphyllin and diphyllin nanoparticles, respectively. Similarly, the antiviral activity of free bafilomycin and bafilomycin nanoparticles against influenza virus H1N1 was also compared in MH-S cells. The results showed that the IC 50 of free bafilomycin was 2.280 nM, whereas that of the bafilomycin nanoparticles was 2.046 nM ( Figure 4D ). The benefit of nanoparticle delivery was less pronounced with bafilomycin, which may be attributed to the strong potency of the compound. Calculation of TI yielded values of 6.82 and 34.02 for the free bafilomycin and bafilomycin nanoparticles, respectively. Compared with free drugs, the nanoparticulate An alamarBlue assay was performed and cell viability was normalized to the value of untreated medium controls (100%). (C) Free diphyllin or diphyllin NP was added to MH-S cells and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were then infected with influenza virus H1N1 at an MOI of 1 for another hour. Viruses were removed and the free diphyllin or diphyllin NP was added back to the cells. Twenty-four hours later, cellular viability was examined by an alamarBlue assay, and cell viability was normalized to the value of uninfected cell controls (100%). (D) Free bafilomycin or bafilomycin NP was added to MH-S cells and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were then infected with influenza virus H1N1 at an MOI of 1 for another hour. Viruses were removed and the free bafilomycin or bafilomycin NP was added back to the cells. Twenty-four hours later, cellular viability was examined by an alamarBlue assay, and cell viability was normalized to the value of uninfected cell controls (100%). Data in the plot represent mean ± seM out of four test replicates. 

To further compare and assess the viral inhibitory effect of free or nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors, the yield of progeny virus upon nanoparticulate diphyllin or bafilomycin treatment in MH-S cells was examined. The results showed that diphyllin nanoparticles induced dose-dependent inhibition against the H1N1 infection. The group treated with 5 and 10 µM diphyllin nanoparticles had a significant decrease in viral TCID 50 titer compared with the untreated and the free diphyllin-treated groups ( Figure 5A) , demonstrating that the nanoparticle-mediated delivery could enhance the anti-influenza activity of the V-ATPase inhibitor. We further examined the nanoparticle's activity against an H3N2 influenza virus to assess its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral. As shown in Figure 5B , the mean viral PFU titer of the group treated with 10 µM diphyllin nanoparticles was 1.6×10 3 PFU/mL, whereas the mean virus titer of the untreated (medium only) group was 2.7×10 5 PFU/mL, validating that the diphyllin nanoparticle can be applied against multiple strains of influenza viruses.

In parallel, the anti-influenza activity for the bafilomycin nanoparticles was also assessed. Similarly, the MH-S cells Notes: (A) MH-S cells were pretreated with free diphyllin or diphyllin nanoparticles (diphyllin NP) and were infected with H1N1 virus at an MOI of 1. Following 24 hours of incubation, the supernatants were harvested to assess the viral TcID 50 titers. Viral titers between free diphyllin and diphyllin NP-treated groups were compared by unpaired t-test. (B) MH-S cells were pretreated with diphyllin nanoparticles and were infected with H3N2 virus at an MOI of 5. Following 24 hours of incubation, the supernatants were harvested to assess virus titers by plaque assay. (C) MH-S cells were pretreated with bafilomycin nanoparticles and were infected with H1N1 at an MOI of 1. Following 24 hours of incubation, the supernatants were harvested to assess the viral TcID 50 titers. Viral titers among drug-treated groups and the untreated control group were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test (ns: nonsignificant, *P,0.05, **P,0.01, ***P,0.001, ****P,0.0001). Data in the plot represent mean ± seM out of three replicates. were pretreated with bafilomycin nanoparticles in various concentrations and then infected with influenza virus H1N1. After infection, the virus was removed and bafilomycin nanoparticles were added to cells. After 24 hours of incubation, the supernatant was harvested to determine the viral titer by TCID 50 . The results showed that the bafilomycin nanoparticles exhibited dose-dependent inhibition against H1N1 virus infection. The viral titer in the group treated with 6.25 nM bafilomycin was 10 2.29 TCID 50 /50 µL and the group treated with 3.125 nM bafilomycin was 10 2.61 TCID 50 /50 µL. These groups significantly reduced viral titer compared with the medium control group (10 3.24 TCID 50 /50 µL) ( Figure 5C ), demonstrating that the nanoparticle delivery strategy can be applied to different types of V-ATPase inhibitors for antiviral applications.

As the diphyllin nanoparticles were previously shown to be well tolerated in mice, 23 we further examined the applicability of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for influenza treatment in vivo, a mouse model of influenza infection was used. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a nonlethal dose of H1N1 virus and intravenously treated with diphyllin nanoparticles equivalent to 10 µg of diphyllin or empty nanoparticles of equivalent polymer content daily for 3 days ( Figure 6A ). The mice were subsequently monitored for weight loss and lung viral load. In the study, the control mice progressively lost weight for 9 days. In contrast, mice treated with diphyllin nanoparticles have reduced body weight loss ( Figure 6B ). The lungs of mice were harvested for viral RNA assessment Figure 6C ). We further evaluated the efficacy of diphyllin nanoparticles in a lethal infection of H1N1 virus ( Figure 7A ). Compared with the control group, mice receiving single treatment of diphyllin nanoparticles showed reduced weight loss ( Figure 7B ) and improved survival rate (33%, 2/6) upon termination of the study ( Figure 7C ). In contrast, all the empty nanoparticlereceiving mice succumbed to virus infection within 6 days postinfection. These in vivo data collectively suggest that the diphyllin nanoparticles are able to reduce disease severity and enhance the survival outcome, mirroring the anti-influenza activity we observed with in vitro investigations.

Because of the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains, more and more anti-influenza studies begin to focus on host-targeted therapies. In our study, we utilized two V-ATPase inhibitors, diphyllin and bafilomycin, to interfere with endosome acidification, which is a critical process for influenza virus replication. Previous studies have also relied on the inhibition of endosome acidification to fight against influenza virus infection, 19, 20, 29 and they have used alternative V-ATPase inhibitor saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and several older V-ATPase inhibitors such as concanamycin A and archazolid B to study their efficacy against influenza A virus in vitro. All the aforementioned V-ATPase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit endosomal acidification and influenza virus replication in vitro, demonstrating broad-spectrum treatment potentials.

Drug delivery and drug toxicity are two critical factors that can undermine the therapeutic potential of a candidate compound. To overcome these challenges, nanoparticulate drug delivery system offers several advantages in terms of improving drug delivery and reducing toxicity compared with the traditional forms of drugs. In our study, diphyllin and bafilomycin are hydrophobic compounds that possess cytotoxicity concerns. To improve the applicability of these compounds, we adopted a PEG-PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticle system, which readily encapsulates waterinsoluble molecules in its hydrophobic polymeric core. The nanocarriers can then facilitate delivery of diphyllin and bafilomycin in the absence of organic solvents, steadying the drugs' pharmacokinetics through PEG-mediated long circulation and sustained drug release. 30 Upon nanoparticle encapsulation, the water solubility of the drugs is improved and the cytotoxicity reduced. Moreover, diphyllin and bafilomycin showed a sustained release profile, which is advantageous toward improving the drugs' pharmacokinetics. In our previous report, we showed that diphyllin nanoparticles could enhance the compound's efficacy against the feline coronavirus, 23 and this study further verified the nanocarriers' effect against influenza virus. Other studies have shown similar benefits upon nanoparticle encapsulation of antivirals. For instance, SaliPhe, a poorly soluble compound, has been encapsulated into porous silicon nanoparticles. SaliPhe-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles improved the compound's water solubility and reduced its side effect. However, the SaliPhe nanoparticles' in vivo efficacy remains to be studied. 29 In another example, HIV-I integrase strand transfer inhibitor Dolutegravir was encapsulated into nanoparticles by a polymer p407. After nanoparticle encapsulation, this drug could better target macrophages and attenuate viral replication and spread of virus to CD4 + T cells. 31 These results echo our present finding that nanoparticulate drug delivery system can be a useful tool for improving the delivery of V-ATPase inhibitors.

AMs are susceptible to influenza virus infection, 32,33 and they play a protective role of immunity in the disease. 34 Depletion of AMs during influenza infection promotes secondary bacterial superinfections, thereby increasing severity of the disease. 35 MH-S cells, an AM cell line derived from BALB/c mice, retain many of the properties of AMs 36 and has been used as an in vitro model for influenza studies. 37 In our data, two nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited potent anti-influenza activity in AMs in vitro, and the effectiveness in other respiratory epithelial cells such as A549, Calu-3, RPMI 2650 cells, or a recently developed well-differentiated airway epithelium culture system 38 are of interest for future investigation. Beyond respiratory tract tissues, several ocular epithelial cells have been shown to support productive replication of both avian and human influenza viruses in vitro or ex vivo, 29, [39] [40] [41] [42] and influenza virus has been isolated from the eye of infected birds. 43 In this study, ARPE-19 cells, a retinal epithelial cell line, were shown to uptake the drug nanoparticles efficiently, suggesting the potential application of V-ATPase-targeting treatment for the viral infection in the eyes. Further studies may be extended to validate the antiviral effectiveness of diphyllin or bafilomycin nanoparticles in this cell.

A major advantage behind antiviral approaches based on interference or promotion of host factors is that they can have broad-spectrum antiviral activities and are less susceptible to drug resistance mutations. As numerous cellular pathways are essential for viral replication, host-directed therapeutics have the potential to reduce viral replication and diminish harmful inflammatory responses. 11, 44 Several host-targeted antivirals are currently under investigation in late-phase clinical trials. 45 In addition to V-ATPase, inhibitors of other host factors may be contemplated for improving the design of antiviral nanoparticles. Given the recent rise in immunomodulatory nanoparticle development, 46,47 antiviral nanoparticles may also incorporate innate immune modulators to further enhance treatment potency. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. The use of diphyllin nanoparticle reduced the severity of influenza and improved the survival outcome in a mouse model of infection, and further investigation of its prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy is warranted. For future studies, drug dosing and administration route can be further optimized. As the nasal epithelium serves as the portal of entry for the influenza virus, 2 a local intranasal administration of the antiviral nanoparticles may be considered. Moreover, an accumulated line of evidence shows that drug combinations significantly improve the anti-influenza efficacy for many existing treatments. [48] [49] [50] We previously showed that combinations of diphyllin and oseltamivir or of diphyllin and amantadine demonstrated enhanced antiviral effect and cell protection. 22 Several randomized controlled trials are set to test the safety and efficacy of various combinations of influenza antivirals. 51 In a recent example, administration of protectin D1, a host-targeted therapeutic candidate, showed 100% protection against a lethal influenza viral challenge when combined with the peramivir, a pathogentargeted antiviral drug, while treatment with protectin D1 or peramivir alone provided only partial protection (30%). 52 In light of these successful combinatorial treatment, simultaneous delivery of multiple synergistic antiviral drugs by a single nanocarrier may be designed under the versatile nanotechnology platform. Furthermore, targeting specificity 

Vacuolar ATPase-inhibiting anti-influenza nanoparticles of host-directed therapeutics may be enhanced by surface modifications of drug-loaded nanoparticles. 53 For instance, influenza virus targeting by nanoparticles was recently demonstrated with a cell membrane-coated nanoparticle. 54 The strategy may be applied to further facilitate antiviral drug targeting. Future studies are warranted to further validate and improve the nanoparticle-based antiviral treatments.

In summary, we have successfully constructed and characterized diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles and bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles. The nanoparticles achieved a sustained release beyond 72 hours and were efficiently taken up by multiple types of cell lines. In cell-based assays, nanoformulated diphyllin or bafilomycin revealed enhanced safety and viral inhibitory activities than free drugs. Moreover, diphyllinloaded nanoparticles showed broad-spectrum activity against two subtypes of virus infections, H1N1 and H3N2. In selecting diphyllin for further in vivo studies, diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles were well tolerated in mice and reduced the weight loss and lung viral load after H1N1 influenza virus infection. The nanoparticles also improved mice survival following a lethal influenza viral challenge. Collectively, this work highlights nanoformulated V-ATPase inhibitors as potential host-targeted treatments against influenza. Continued development of the nanoformulations is warranted.

Inhibitor-Based Therapeutics for Treatment of Viral Hepatitis,"Viral hepatitis remains a significant worldwide threat, in spite of the availability of several successful therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Complications associated with acute and chronic infections, such as liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Given the significant burden on the healthcare system caused by viral hepatitis, it is essential that novel, more effective therapeutics be developed. The present review attempts to summarize the current treatments against viral hepatitis, and provides an outline for upcoming, promising new therapeutics. Development of novel therapeutics requires an understanding of the viral life cycles and viral effectors in molecular detail. As such, this review also discusses virallyencoded effectors, found to be essential for virus survival and replication in the host milieu, which may be utilized as potential candidates for development of alternative therapies in the future.","Hepatitis is a medical condition wherein the liver undergoes inflammation due to a plethora of reasons, including drug abuse, excessive alcohol abuse, disease conditions etc. 1 When such inflammation, as manifested in symptoms such as jaundice, nausea, abdominal pain, malaise etc, is caused by viral infections, the condition is referred to as viral hepatitis. 1 Five hepatotropic virusesnamed hepatitis A, B, C, D and E virusestarget liver cells in humans and cause acute and chronic hepatitis. In addition, other viruses such as the adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), occasionally cause symptoms of hepatitis. 2 While an acute infection in healthy, immunocompetent individuals is cleared spontaneously, complications like cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) may arise in immunocompromised individuals, due to associated secondary reasons such as existing infections, alcohol abuse, or genetic predisposition. 1,3 HCC, the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 4 is closely associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Even though the therapeutic strategies devised till date are targeted towards chronic infections, treatment options become severely limited for advanced stage patients. 1 In addition, current medications have significant side-effects, which poses an issue with disease management. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for safer and more potent drugs.

This review will focus on the therapeutics currently available for treating viral hepatitis of all forms. In addition, the potential of new therapeutics and targeted inhibitor-based therapies against viral membrane-penetrating peptides and viroporins, a group of virally encoded proteins involved in facilitating replication and other specific steps in the viral life cycle, are also discussed.

Life cycles of the known hepatotropic virusesparticularly A, B, C and Ehave been studied in significant detail. Although the lack of appropriate cell culture systems, and the slowgrowing nature of the virus, has hampered studies, considerable information is available on the entry, replication and exit mechanisms of these viruses, and on specific hostinteracting partners for each virus. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is thought to associate with a cell-surface protein receptor, HAVcr-1/TIM-1 (Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1/T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, by which it gains entry into host cells. 5 Post-entry, translation of the positive-sense RNA genome by the host ribosomal machinery, mediated via the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) encoded in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of viral RNA, results in the production of a large viral polyprotein. The polyprotein is cleaved into structural (VP1-2A, VP2, VP3, VP4) and nonstructural proteins (2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D) as well as intermediates (3CD, 2BC etc) by a virally-encoded protease 3C pro . Following the cleavage event, the viral RNA replicase synthesizes a minus-sense strand corresponding to the viral RNA genome, which serves as a template for the production of multiple plus-sense strands. Meanwhile, structural proteins assemble to form virions, which package a majority of the plus-sense RNA generated during replication. Two specific cleavage events result in generation of mature infectious virions -the VP1-2A precursor cleavage and the VP4/VP2 junctional cleavage. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Virions are subsequently released from the apical membrane of infected hepatocytes. 11 Entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into target host cells is a multistep event, requiring several host components. The cellular receptors and surface molecules, which are thought to be involved in this process, include the C-type lectins liver/ lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN) and dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), claudins 6 and 9 and CD-81. [12] [13] [14] Binding to cellular receptor(s) is primarily mediated by the viral envelope proteins E1 and E2. Post-entry, the virus nucleocapsid disassembles releasing the plus-sense RNA genome in the cell cytosol, which acts as a template for 5'-IRES mediated translation. The single HCV polyprotein generated during translation, like the corresponding HAV polypeptide, also undergoes protease mediated co-and post-processing to yield the entire repertoire of viral structural and non-structural proteins. 14 During HCV infection, membranous webs [14] [15] [16] are formed, which are sites for RNA replication (NS5B mediated) and translational post-processing events. While the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as the site for the formation of the viral nucleocapsid, envelope formation and final virus maturation occurs in the Golgi. Matured virions are exocytosed into the extracellular space. 14 The life cycle of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not well understood, primarily due to the non-availability of an appropriate cell culture system. Studies have shown the possible involvement of heat shock cognate 70 protein (HSC70) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the initial attachment of HEV to its target cells, while the final entry is mediated by a yet unknown receptor. 17, 18 Several host factors, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), are also thought to be involved in viral entry. 19, 20 Capsid uncoating and RNA genome release in the cytosol is closely followed by translation of the viral open reading frame (ORF) 1, which encodes the entire non-structural cassette. 21, 22 Multiple copy synthesis of the positive-sense RNA genome is mediated by virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The viral ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, which associates with the progeny viral genomes to form the nucleocapsids, followed by the intracellular transport and release of mature virions. 21, 22 It has been postulated that the viral ORF3 encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking process. 21, 22 HBV, unlike other hepatotropic viruses, has a distinct mechanism for propagation within its host. Cellular entry of incoming particles via endocytosis is initiated through interactions with HSPGs, 23, 24 followed by that with the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). 24, 25 After gaining access to the cytosol, the virus travels to the nuclear pore complex, where the DNA genome is released into the nucleus. The partially double-stranded DNA genome is subsequently converted into a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form which associates with histones and other nuclear proteins. Within the nucleus, transcription events lead to the production of mRNA, encoding for the reverse transcriptase and the nucleocapsid (pregenomic). In addition, transcripts encoding the surface antigens (subgenomic) are also produced. Both pre-and subgenomic transcrpits are transferred to the cytosol. Surface protein synthesis, to generate core and subviral particles, occurs in the ER. Translation products (viral polymerase and core protein) of the pregenomic RNA associate with protein kinases (PKs), 26, 27 HSPs 27,28 and pregenomic RNA to yield mature core particles, which are either released from infected cells, or are recirculated to the nucleus to maintain the cccDNA level. 25, 28 Interestingly, while subviral particles are released via the secretory pathway involving the Golgi and ER, mature core particles are released through multivesicular particles. 25 Although not much is known regarding the cellular entry process of hepatitis D virus (HDV), studies have suggested similarities with the HBV entry pathway involving interaction of HSPGs and NTCPs with the viral large hepatitis B surface antigen (L-HBsAg; pre-S1 domain). 24, 29 Post-entry, transfer of the RNA genome to the nucleus is facilitated by the virallyencoded hepatitis D antigen (HDAg). 30 Within the nucleus, host RNA polymerases initiate genome replication, which proceeds via a rolling circle mechanism. 30 Subsequent transcriptional and translational events lead to the production of the large delta antigen which undergoes prenylation prior to association with progeny viral genomes. Subsequent assembly and viral release requires assistance from HBV. 30 Current treatment scenario HAV Currently there are no specific treatment options available for HAV. Infected individuals usually receive symptomatic treatment, with liver transplantation being the only viable option in cases of FHF. 11 Vaccination, with inactivated HAV virions, is fairly effective for conferring protection against all prevalent strains of the virus found in the human population. 31, 32 Vaccination with attenuated virions has also been employed, but has met with limited success. 33 In spite of active vaccination efforts, however, the number of clinical cases of HAV reported is quite high, being ;1.5 million worldwide. 11 HCV Due to the mostly asymptomatic nature of acute HCV infection, treatment options are limited. However, studies have reported that interferon-based treatment at an early stage might be helpful. 34 Individuals exhibiting HCV RNA and antibodies at detectable levels in their blood after more than 6 months post-infection are considered to be cases of chronic HCV infection. A combination therapy of ribavirin and Peg-IFN-a (pegylated interferon a), for a duration of either six months or one year, was the accepted treatment regimen for chronic cases of HCV infection up until 2011. 35 However, achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR), which is the key to cure, was observed to vary between genotypes and populations. 36 Western European patients infected with HCV genotype 1 reportedly achieve a higher SVR (50%) than the North American patient population (40%). The SVR achieved with this treatment in case of patients infected with genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6 was observed to be higher in general compared to genotype 1-infected patients (SVR of up to 80%). In particular, genotype 2 was the found to be most susceptible (SVR > 80%). 36 Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as telaprevir and boceprevir (first-wave, first generation), which target the HCV NS3-4A serine protease, were introduced in 2011 for treating infections caused by HCV genotype 1. 37 Phase III clinical trials on treatmentnaïve patients found that administration of telaprevir and boceprevir in conjunction with ribavirin and Peg-IFN-a (triple-combination) was effective in achieving a SVR in the range between 65% and 75%. 37 However, this treatment regimen comes with its own set of disadvantages, including significant side-effects and not being cost-effective in the case of patients with advanced fibrosis. 37 Since 2011, the following DAAs have been approved which can be used either independently or in combination with Peg-IFN-a and/or ribavirin. These DAAs are (a) sofosbuvir (nucleotide analogue), (b) simeprevir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor), (c) daclatasvir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor), (d) paritaprevir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor), (e) ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor), (f) asunaprevir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor), (g) grazoprevir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor) and (h) elbasvir (NS5A replication complex inhibitor). 35 The rate of SVR achieved depends on the combination used, the genotype, the presence of resistant strains and the disease severity. Finally, attempts to create an effective vaccine against HCV have not been successful till date due to the extreme sequence variation of the virus genome.

HEV Acute HEV infections in immunocompetent individuals usually culminate in spontaneous clearance of the virus after a certain time period. However, in severe cases leading to decreased liver functioning, administration of ribavirin was found to help in prompt clearance of the virus and inhibition of further liver damage. 38 It remains unclear if ribavirin intake can arrest the progress towards complete liver failure (fulminant hepatitis). Till date, liver transplantation from appropriate donors remains the only choice for such patients. 39 For treatment of transplantation patients suffering from chronic infection with HEV, the following course of action is usually undertaken post-transplantation. The first step involves the reduction of immunosuppression, which has been shown to have a 25% clearance rate. 40 If this is unsuccessful, the next step usually involves monotherapy with ribavirin for an initial period of 90 days. 39, 41, 42 Administration of Peg-IFN-a is also an option; however, due to its many side-effects and complications in solid organ transplantation recipient patients, it is not preferred. 39 HEV infection in pregnant women is associated with significant complications like stillbirths, abortions, premature distribution and maternal or fetal death. 43 Interestingly, significant differences exist in the severity of complications caused by HEV infection in diverse endemic populations. For instance, while the infection typically has severe outcomes in pregnant women from northern India, it follows a fairly benign course in populations from Egypt and western countries. 44, 45 Studies suggest that poor prenatal care and nutrition may constitute major contributory factors for such severe outcomes in selected populations. 46 Efforts are ongoing to develop an effective vaccine against HEV, and currently a promising candidate (trade name: Hecolin) is in Phase IV of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov database).

As with other forms of hepatitis, acute infections with HBV are treated symptomatically 47, 48 and no specific treatment regimen exists. However, patients who develop acute liver failure resulting from severe HBV infection are administered oral anti-HBV medication. 49 The major emphasis so far is on treatment of chronic infection of HBV. The currently approved drugs are interferons, Peg-IFN-2a for adults and IFN-a-2b for children, and nucleotide/nucleoside analogues or NAs (nucleoside analogues: lamivudine, entecavir, emtricitabine, telbivudine; nucleotide analogues: adefovir, tenofovir). 50, 51 Due to their high barrier to development of resistance, tenofovir and entecavir are used as the first-line drugs for treatment. 50, 51 Other analogues like lamivudine, adefovir and telbivudine are only prescribed when the more potent drugs are either not appropriate or not available. 50, 51 This is due to fact that these drugs either have a low barrier to resistance (telbivudine), are less efficacious (adefovir) or have been shown to develop resistance over long-term usage (lamivudine). 50 Interferons are utilized as they enhance the host antviral immune response. 50, 51 The therapeutic strategy usually involves two specific routes applicable to chronic hepatitis B (CHB): (i) a short treatment (1 year) with Peg-IFNs or NAs and (ii) treatment with NAs on a long-term basis.

i. Peg-IFN-based therapy is prescribed for a period of 48 weeks for patients who have the best possibility for HBe seroconversion (absence of HBeAg in serum and presence of anti-HBe antibodies) in order to obtain an off-treatment response. 50, 52 Combinations of Peg-IFN with NAs like lamivudine or telbivudine are not recommended because of a low off-treatment response for the former and due to recipients developing polyneuropathy for the latter. 53 HBeAg-positive patients who undergo serotype conversion to anti-HBe can be treated with NAs for some time. However, it is not possible to define exactly the timespan before treatment initiation since it is based on the time taken to undergo serotype conversion and treatment continuation postseroconversion. 50 A stable off-treatment response in (40-80)% of treated individuals has been observed 54 when treatment is continued for about 12 months post serotype conversion to anti-HBe. ii. The second strategy applies to those individuals who do not undergo seroconversion and have HBV-related liver cirrhosis. 50 Entecavir and tenofovir are used, however, the long term effects of the use of these drugs is not known. Current data shows that monotherapy for 3 years or more ensures remission in majority of treated patients. [55] [56] [57] Patients undergoing liver transplantation due to HBVrelated HCC or decompensated liver cirrhosis undergo a pre-transplantation treatment regime with a potent NA having a high resistance barrier in order to reduce the viral DNA levels to a minimum before transplantation. 58, 59 Posttreatment, a combination of adefovir and/or lamivudine with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) has been found to be effective (graft rejection rate of less than 10%). 59,60 Given the treatment scenario and the complications associated, prevention of HBV infections is a priority. An effective vaccine against HBV exists and is administered 3-4 times over a 6 month period. 58 HDV Till date, there are no known effective therapeutic strategies available for treatment of either the acute or chronic forms of HDV infection. 61 Studies have shown that long-term treatment with Peg-IFNa helps in clearance of the virus in about 25% of the cases. 61 The efficacy is similar when interferon is administered in combination with adefovir. 61 Thus, in the absence of an effective antiviral therapy, liver transplantation is the only option for patients suffering from liver damage due to chronic infection. There are no commercially available vaccines against HDV; however, the vaccine available for HBV can be used to prevent co-infection of HBV and HDV. 61 62 Upon their uptake by cells, nucleoside analogues undergo a set of three phosphorylation events, producing nucleoside triphosphates that lack a 3'-OH group on the deoxyribose sugar. These inhibit the replication process by chain termination and stalling replication-associated polymerases. NAs have a similar mechanism of action, with the distinction that they essentially bypass the phosphorylation steps. 63 Several such drugs, like emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, entecavir, stavudine, abacavir etc, are available for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several analogues are also being used in treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infections, as mentioned in the previous sections. Other effective inhibitors include favipiravir, which can successfully inhibit both negative-and positive-sense RNA viruses and has been approved for the treatment of influenza virus in Japan, and BCX4430, which shows similar inhibitory effects. 62 These compounds have significant toxicity issues and side-effects due to the replication inhibition being primarily non-specific. In addition, resistant phenotypes are often encountered, which decreases treatment efficacy. 62 (b) Non-NA polymerase inhibitors, on the other hand, are targeted to bind to sites other than the active site on viral polymerases, and induce conformational changes, leading to down-regulation in activity. In this class, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors like nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz are well known. These primarily inhibit HIV-1 replication by binding to the p66 subunit of the p66/p51 heterodimeric complex. 64 The nomenclature is based on the structural organization of the HCV NS5B. 65 ii. Proteases play an essential role in the life cycle of many viruses, making them essential targets for inhibitor design. The HIV protease cleaves the viral polyproteins into individual components, and inhibiting the protease can effectively block viral replication. 66 Currently, the United States' Food and Drug Administration has approved several inhibitor drugs which belong in this category, namely saquinavir, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and tipranavir. While inhibitors against the NS3-4A serine protease of HCV, such as boceprevir and telaprevir, were used initially, their usage has been discontinued since a more effective treatment regimen of simeprevir, asunaprevir and paritaprevir are now available, as mentioned earlier herein. Several 3C or 3C like proteases exist in picornaviruses, coronaviruses and noroviruses. 62 In fact, rupintrivir (an irreversible 3C protease inhibitor), which was originally designed to treat rhinovirus infections, also displays inhibitory activity against the above mentioned virus families. 67 Lastly, treatment regimen usually involves combination therapy due to chances of emergence of resistant phenotypes. 62 iii. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) belongs to a ubiquitous, hostencoded protein family (peptidyl-prolyl cis/transisomerases), which helps in folding and trafficking of other host proteins. 68 CyPA was found to interact with the non-structural protein NS5A 69,70 of HCV and the capsid protein p24 of HIV. 71 Presently, two drugs that inhibit CyPA, namely alisporivir and SCY-635, are in use. Both drugs are derivatives of the original immunosuppressive drugs sanglifehrin A and cyclosporine A. 62 iv. Since host lipid metabolism is essential for viral replication, 72 compounds which specifically alter this process have been found to inhibit viral infections. Perhaps the most notable of this class of inhibitors are the statins, which block cholesterol biosynthesis by obstructing the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A. 62 However, although this class of inhibitors have shown positive results in vitro against several pathogens like HIV and HCV, significant contradictions were encountered during in vivo studies. 62 The indole derivative arbidol interferes with virus membrane fusion and entry of enveloped viruses. Although it has been approved in China and Russia for treating respiratory pathogens like influenza virus, and in vitro data on HBV, Chikungunya and HCV appears encouraging, data related to the in vivo efficacy of this drug is lacking. 62 LJ001 is another lipid modulator that induces membrane lipid oxidation and interferes with virus membrane fusion. It was found to be fairly effective against enveloped viruses such as influenza, filoviruses and HIV, 73 but its poor physiological stability and requirement of light for optimal activity makes it rather unsuitable for further development. Derivatives of LJ001 have since been produced with improved characteristics. 62 Squalamines are compounds that interact with the host membrane and alter the cellular microenvironment to make it unsuitable for virus propagation. This compound has also been successful in phase II trials for retinal vasculopathies and cancer, warranting its further development. 62 Several new targets have been identified in HBV against which inhibitors have been designed, and many are presently at different stages of development or in clinical trials. These include potent polymerase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, cccDNA inhibitors, nucleocapsid assembly inhibitors, inhibitors of viral gene expression and HBsAg release inhibitors. Equally effective but safer derivatives of tenofovir and entecavir (tenofovir alafenamide and besofovir) have shown promising results in randomized phase III trials with respect to bone and renal safety profiles. [74] [75] [76] [77] Besofovir is another drug which is being tested as an alternative to entecavir. 78, 79 Myrcludex-B is an engineered lipopeptide that effectively blocks NTCP receptors, the entry points for incoming HBV virions. 80 Mouse model studies with Myrcludex-B have shown a reduction in both cccDNA levels and virus spread, and phase II clinical trials are currently ongoing. 80 Three types of site-specific DNA binding proteins are being engineered to target cccDNA: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas endonucleases. 81 In vitro studies in cells have shown that all three systems can deactivate cccDNA by either site-specific cleavage, 82 by introducing frameshifts in viral ORFs 83 or by specific disruption (CRISPR-Cas). 84, 85 Disubstituted sulphonamides (CCC-0975 and CCC-0346) have also been identified; these have been shown to prevent the formation of cccDNA from relaxed circular DNA in vitro. 86 Compounds that prevent the encapsidation of viral pregenomic RNA, such as sulfamoylbenzamide and phenylpropenamide derivatives, also constitute attractive options for therapy. 87, 88 These are effective against both NA-resistant and wild-type HBV. 89 Inhibition of viral gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi) is a very attractive option since low levels of viral antigens will allow the immune system to recover. ARC-520, one such drug under development, has shown promising results in vitro. 90,91 A nucleic acid polymer, REP 2055, has been shown to be able to inhibit the release of HBsAg from infected hepatocytes in in vivo studies. 92 Finally, recent studies have also shown that the HBV RnaseH, which is critical for virus replication, can also be an important drug target. 93, 94 As in the case of HBV, novel drug targets have been identified in other hepatotropic viruses as well (Table 1) .

The virus life cycle begins when it infects a suitable host in order to make multiple copies of itself by utilizing the host machinery. The process from infection to generation of progeny virions is executed as a series of very well coordinated steps and involves attachment, entry, uncoating, replication-transcription-translation of genetic material, assembly and egress. The virus genome encodes a limited number of proteins, all of which can be categorized primarily into structural and non-structural proteins. While structural proteins generate the virus capsid, non-structural proteins are produced after infection and are usually not a part of the capsid. 74, 95 Recently, a set of viral proteins have been identified which play essential roles in the virus life cycle, primarily through their ability to interact with and penetrate cellular membranes. This class of multifunctional proteins, designated viroporins, form pores or channels in cellular membranes, which directly or indirectly facilitate the intracellular survival of the virus. 96 It has been suggested that the ability of viroporins to alter ionic concentration and remodel host cell membranes, enhances viral uncoating, replication and egress. 96 Usually viroporins are small peptides (up to 100 amino acids) and contain one or more transmembrane domain(s). Formation of pores or channels in cellular membranes is facilitated by homo-oligomerization between viroporins. Oligomerization levels can range from dimeric association (e.g. in HAV 2B) 97 to large heptameric assemblies (e.g. in HCV p7). 96 Till date, several viroporins have been identified and functionally characterized for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (Fig. 1 , Table 2 ). Some of the well-known examples are influenza A virus M2, HIV-1 Vpu, picornavirus 2B and HCV p7. 96 The central role of viroporins in facilitating several steps in the life cycle of viruses suggests that this class of viral proteins are promising candidates for development of inhibitor-based therapeutics. In fact, small molecule inhibitors have been successfully designed and tested against certain viroporins with encouraging outcomes; drugs such as amantadine and rimantadine have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the ion channel activity of M2. 98, 99 Interestingly, several influenza strains, with specific point mutations (Leu26Phe, Ser31Asn, Val27Ala, Ala30Thr, Leu28Phe Ser31Asn and Gly34Glu) which cause resistance to M2 inhibitors have been identified recently. 79 These mutations most likely affect the drug binding sites of the M2 channel by altering binding pocket hydrophobicity or the overall conformation of the channel. The most prevalent point mutation is Ser31Asn, which has been identified in the H1N1, H7N9 and H1N5 strains of the virus. Attempts are currently being made to synthesize inhibitors against the resistant strains using derivatives of M2 inhibitors. Although novel effective derivatives have been obtained against several of the mutations, those against point mutations at Asn31 have proven to be difficult to generate. 98 Hexamethylene amilorides (HMA), and its derivatives (e.g. BIT225), have been found to be effective in blocking Vpu channel activity and is thought to bind in the channel lumen. The BIT225 HMA derivative is currently undergoing clinical trials. 98 This inhibitor is specific to HIV-1 and till date no resistant strains have been reported. Coronavirus-encoded E peptides are also effectively blocked by HMA, as has been observed in electrophysiology studies using HEK-293T cells. 98 Amantadine is also capable of inhibiting activity, but the effect requires significantly higher concentrations. 98 Adamantanes, alkyl imino-sugars and HMA were identified as HCV p7 blockers based on protein based in vitro assays. 98, 100 However, studies reported inconsistency in efficacy data, which was preliminarily due to the genotypic/subtypic differences between the p7 channels, even though compounds like rimatadine and N-nonyl deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) exhibited wide-spectrum activity amongst genotypes. 98 Availability of high resolution structural data and in silico docking studies helped in unravelling the mechanism of action of these inhibitors. 80 NN-DNJ was found to interfere with p7 oligomerization via interaction with a specific phenylalanine residue at the 25 th position. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of adamantane was found to be due to binding of the inhibitor at a peripheral site (Leu20) that is exposed on the membrane, separate from the NN-DNJ binding site. 98 The disparate binding sites for inhibitors provides the possibility of using a combination therapy approach to treat resistant strains. Current drug development efforts typically use a combination of rational and high-throughput approaches. This has resulted in identification of compounds against resistant p7 phenotypes with higher potency at minimal concentrations. 98 Current interest and the pool of available data leads to the conclusion that viroporin-based therapeutic approaches will subsequently play an important role in treating clinically In the case of enveloped viruses, steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent attachment, entry, uncoating and replication, assembly and egress, respectively. For non-enveloped viruses, steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 represent attachment, entry, release from the intracellular vesicle, uncoating and replication, assembly and egress processes. relevant human pathogens. The approaches towards designing inhibitors for treatment of HCV and its resistant phenotypes can also be extended to the other hepatotropic viruses. In fact, recent work from our laboratory has characterized the membrane activity of capsid component VP4 and nonstructural protein 2B from HAV. 97, 101 Utilizing a combination of biophysical studies, MD simulation and electron microscopy, it was shown that VP4 forms discreet pores of 5;9 nm in artificial membranes. Our data thus indicates that VP4 is a membrane penetrating peptide which may allow HAV to escape from endosomes and gain access to the cellular cytosol. The potentially critical role played by VP4 in HAV entry makes it an important target for design of inhibitors.

We further investigated the non-structural 2B protein of HAV, which was found to contain a stretch of 60 residues in its C-terminus, and which has viroporin-like activity. 97 A combination of crosslinking studies, biophysical assays and simulation was employed to determine that 2B probably forms dimers and generates ;3 nm pores in membranes. The resulting alteration of membrane permeability is thought to be essential for HAV replication. It is probable that inhibition of the membrane activity of 2B would negatively impact the viral replication process. Thus, a treatment regimen against HAV, which includes a combination therapy targeting VP4 and 2B, could be a very promising and effective approach.

Given the essential roles played by viroporins and viral membrane penetrating peptides in enhancing several aspects of the virus life cycle, targeted inhibitor therapy holds promise for development of virus-specific drugs. Establishing the commonalities between the structures and functions of these membrane active components might make it easier to design small molecule inhibitors. Finally, given the promise of p7-based therapy against HCV, it is essential to pinpoint such potential candidates in other hepatotropic viruses, in order to expand therapy options against chronic and acute viral hepatitis.

Nanoparticle Vaccines Against Infectious Diseases,"Due to emergence of new variants of pathogenic micro-organisms the treatment and immunization of infectious diseases have become a great challenge in the past few years. In the context of vaccine development remarkable efforts have been made to develop new vaccines and also to improve the efficacy of existing vaccines against specific diseases. To date, some vaccines are developed from protein subunits or killed pathogens, whilst several vaccines are based on live-attenuated organisms, which carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under certain immunocompromised conditions. To avoid this, the development of risk-free effective vaccines in conjunction with adequate delivery systems are considered as an imperative need to obtain desired humoral and cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases. In the last several years, the use of nanoparticle-based vaccines has received a great attention to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to achieve desired immune responses at the cellular level. To improve vaccine efficacy, these nanocarriers should protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, facilitate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, control release, and should be safe for human use. Nanocarriers composed of lipids, proteins, metals or polymers have already been used to attain some of these attributes. In this context, several physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles play an important role in the determination of vaccine efficacy. This review article focuses on the applications of nanocarrier-based vaccine formulations and the strategies used for the functionalization of nanoparticles to accomplish efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce desired host immunity against infectious diseases.","In twenty-first Century, infectious diseases have emerged as a serious threat to the health of millions of people across the globe (1) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report for 2016, ∼3.2 million deaths have occurred due to lower respiratory infections and 1.4 million from tuberculosis alone worldwide (2) . Over the past few decades, many new infectious diseases have emerged and few old diseases re-emerged, which were once considered to be no longer a threat to the human being (3) (4) (5) . Collectively, these diseases account for millions of deaths that cause enormous impact on the global socio-economical and health-care sectors. The major challenges to combat such diseases are that for many of them, there are no effective drugs available.

One of the plausible approaches could be based on the application of nanocarrier based vaccination (6) . However, there are still no effective vaccines available against some of the most prevalent diseases including immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis. This underlines an urgent need for the development of desired vaccines against these diseases. Some of the important aspects of any optimal vaccine includes (i) safety, (ii) stability, and (iii) the ability to elicit durable and adequate immune response with a minimum number of doses (7) (8) (9) . Presently, different generation vaccines such as attenuated or killed whole organisms (first generation), subunit (second generation) and RNA or DNA vaccines (third generation) are used to elicit protective immunity against diseases (10) (11) (12) . Despite several advantages of RNA or DNA vaccines such as minimal risk of infection, ability to elicit immune response against specific pathogen and cost effective (13) ; there are a number of challenges associated with the efficient delivery of these vaccine molecules to the target sites and the requirement of the prime-boost vaccination regimens with other immunogenic agents. These includes premature degradation of molecules and the inability to translate into a functional immunogen (14) . Similarly, protein based vaccines are used successfully against several infectious diseases such as Haemophilus influenza type b, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertusis, meningococcus and pneumococcus (15) , however they require an adjuvant to potentiate their immunogenicity, and also encounter early degradation after exposure to hostile milieu. Introduced recombinant proteinbased vaccines (e.g., recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine for influenza) further enhance the immunity toward infection indicating the applicability of the recombinant technology for the vaccine production (16) . To overcome these hurdles, an efficient vaccine delivery system is required which not only delivers the vaccine molecules to the target site to evoke enduring immune responses but also has minimal side effects and requires less doses. Moreover, there is an increasing need to develop new generation composite vaccine molecules that will act as immunogen as well as an adjuvant. Nanotechnology based formulations offer numerous advantages for the development of new generation vaccines. Nanocarrier based delivery system can protect the vaccines from premature degradation, improve stability, has good adjuvant properties, and also assists in targeted delivery of an immunogen to the antigen presenting cells (APCs). There are several mechanisms by which vaccines can be delivered to the specific sites using nanocarriers. Vaccine antigens can be encapsulated within the nanocarriers or decorated on their surface (Figure 1) . Encapsulation within the nanoparticles (NPs) can protect the antigen from premature protease degradation and elicit sustainable release, whereas the surface adsorption facilitates their interaction with cognate surface receptors such as toll like receptors (TLRs) of APCs (17) . Nanocarrier based delivery systems provide a suitable route of administration of vaccine molecules and enhance cellular uptake thereby resulting in robust innate, humoral, cellular as well as mucosal immune responses when compared with unconjugated antigens. This review mainly focuses on the potential use of nano delivery systems as novel vaccine strategies for the induction of innate as well as adaptive immune responses against infectious diseases. FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the nanocarriers. Antigen can be conjugated to the nanoparticles surface or incapsulated into core of the particles. Decoration of the nanoparticles surface with targeting molecules (e.g., antibodies, Fab-fragments, peptides, etc) could further increase the delivery of particles into the antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce innate and adaptive immune responses.

The immune system is composed of a collection of mobile cells that traffic throughout the body as well as reside at the site of entry (i.e., skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genital tracts) in search of invading pathogens. These cells belong to two major types of innate and adaptive immune system. The innate immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils rapidly respond to the pathogens by recognizing pathogen surface moieties, phagocytosis, and the elimination of pathogens through activation of different antibacterial effector functions. Similarly, two major components of the adaptive immunity i.e., T and B-cells are important for the generation of cell mediated and humoral immune responses, respectively. T cells including CD4 + helper T cells secrete different cytokines to modulate the functions of B cells, whereas CD8 + T cells recognize and destroy virally infected cells. Antibodies produced by the B cells can further neutralize the invading microbes or clear infected cell or opsonized pathogens through cell-mediated systems. APCs, in particular dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, migrate through the body to sample, process and present the antigens to T-cells to activate cellular immune responses. These cells express various surface receptors to recognize cognate ligands and danger signals to trigger activation of different signaling pathways that eventually lead to the activation of T-cells (18) . After sampling the antigens, DCs migrate from the peripheral tissues into the draining lymph nodes to activate naive T-cells (19) , whereas macrophages after ingestion of antigens increase their lysosomal degradative machinery to enhance the antigen presentation to activate helper T cells.

Some NPs are themselves able to stimulate different immune cells to boost the host immunity. The size, shape and surface chemistry of NPs (described below in more detail) are important factors that determine their potential to activate immune responses. In general, NPs are able to stimulate immune reactions by increasing the synthesis of defense genes and inflammatory reactions (20). Various types of NPs like gold, carbon, dendrimers, polymers and liposomes have the capability to induce cytokine and antibody responses (21-26). This was observed in the case of administration of empty PEGylated liposomes, which were able to elicit IgM response in an in-vivo model. (27, 28) . Besides their potential to deliver various immune stimulators to the specific sites as well as into the deep tissues where vaccine molecules alone may not able to reach, these NPs have also been exploited as adjuvants to augment immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. Nano-immuno stimulators are the nano scale (20-100 nm) vaccine particles that can improve the vaccine efficacy in vivo better than bulk molecules (20, 29). Some of the known nano-immuno stimulators that have been used for this specific purpose are inorganic NPs (iron and silica) (30, 31), polymeric NPs (chitosan, PLGA, PVPONAlk, γ-PGA) (32-37), liposomes (cholesterol and lipids) (33, 38) and virus like particles (VLPs) (39, 40). Different types of NPs used to deliver antigens to give protection against different diseases have been listed in Table 1 .

Some biocompatible inorganic NPs such as gold, carbon and silica have been exploited in the vaccine delivery studies (50, [79] [80] [81] . These NPs can be synthesized in various shapes, size and surface modified forms. Some of the viral antigens were successfully delivered using inorganic NPs as carriers. This caused increase in antigen stability by protecting them from premature degradation by proteolytic enzymes. Delivery of viral and bacterial antigens using gold NPs was also found to induce quite robust host immune responses against influenza, immunodeficiency virus, foot and mouth, and tuberculosis diseases in mice (51, 52, 82, 83) . Encapsulation of plasmid DNA that encode mycobacterial hsp65 antigen in gold NPs exhibited significant reduction in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causative agent of human tuberculosis, burden in infected mice (52, 82). Few studies have used hollow mesosporous silica, nanotube and spherical forms of carbon NPs as adjuvants to improve the immunogenicity and delivery of protein and peptide antigens against viral infections (79, 83, 84) . Silica based NPs contain abundant silanol groups that can be utilized to introduce specific functional groups on their surface to gain access for vaccine molecules into target cells (84) (85) (86) . The major advantages of inorganic NPs include low production cost, reproducibility and safety in application.

In recent years, polymeric NPs have received great attention for their applications in the delivery of a number of vaccines. This is primarily due to their ease in preparation, biodegradability, biocompatibility, reduced cytotoxicity, and the possibility to fine-tune surface properties as needed (87) . Moreover, it is relatively easy to control the rate of vaccine release by altering the composition or ratio of co-polymers during the NP synthesis process (87) . The most commonly used polymeric NPs for vaccine delivery are poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid; PLGA) or poly (lactic acid; PLA). PLGA NPs have already been tried in the delivery of a broad range of antigens, including hydrophobic antigens (34, 35), hepatitis-B virus antigens (54), Bacillus anthracis (41), tetanus toxoid (35), and ovalbumin (88) . The use of PLGA conjugated antigens exhibited strong immunostimulatory property by inducing cytokine and nitric oxide production against mycobacteria infection (89) . In addition to synthetic polymers, some natural biopolymers such as alginate, pullans, inulins, and chitosan have been used as adjuvants (90) (91) (92) (93) . Inulin, a known activator of the complement cascade (94) , conferred better protection against hepatitis B and influenza viruses (92, 93) . Similarly, chitosan NPs were demonstrated as nanocarrier molecules for HBV antigens (55), DNA vaccine (56), and Newcastle disease vaccine (42). The delivery of PLGA and chitosan NP conjugated vaccine molecules enhanced the immune responses at the mucosal site (95, 96) . Our recent study also showed that delivery of M. tuberculosis lipids using biocompatible chitosan NPs was able to induce significant humoral as well as cellular immune responses when compared to lipids alone in mice (43). We also found that intraperitoneal administration of these conjugates showed better activation of splenic T-cells. Another study by de Titta et al. has shown that intradermal administration of CpG conjugated polymeric NPs increased dendritic cell activation by several fold, exhibited comparable vaccine efficacy at ∼400 times lower dose, and also caused enduring cellular immunity in comparison to free CpG (97) . These desired properties along with already known reduced toxicity and biocompatibility under both in vitro and in vivo conditions make polymeric NPs plausible candidates for further preclinical pharmacokinetics and therapeutic applications (98) .

In addition to polymeric NPs, liposomes are the second most widely explored vaccine and drug delivery vehicle in the nanomedicine field. The synthesis of liposomes is a spontaneous process, where hydration of lipids enables the lipid bilayer formation around an aqueous core (99) . So far, different types of liposomes, including unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles composed of biodegradable phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholin and cholesterol) were included in the vaccine studies (100) . Liposomes deliver vaccines by fusion with the target cell membrane (101) .The structurally flexible and versatile liposomes are able to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. The hydrophilic molecules can be incorporated into the aqueous core, while hydrophobic molecules are encased within the phospholipid bilayer. Earlier reports have shown that delivery of antigenic proteins entrapped in multilamellar lipid vesicles elicit strong T and B-cell responses (102) . Similarly antigenic peptides conjugated to phosphatidylserine (PS)-liposomes were readily Polypeptide Nanoparticles Rhodent mamarial parasitic infection (77) Surface protein from Eimeria falciformis sporozoites ISCOMs Diarrhea (78) internalized by APCs to potentiate T-helper cell mediated immune responses (103) and delivery of heat shock protein encoding vaccine DNA using liposomes elicited strong protective immunity against fungal infection (104) . Because of their foreseen applications, several liposome based vaccine nano-formulations have been approved for clinical trials against intracellular pathogens, including viruses and M. tuberculosis (105) . One such study already demonstrated the potency of liposomal aerosol carriers in the generation of protective immunity against M. tuberculosis infection (106, 107) . Other studies have tried a combination of dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium (DDA) lipid based liposomes and various immunomodulators to enhance immunity against influenza, chlamydia, erythrocytic-stage malaria, and tuberculosis infections (108) (109) (110) (111) (112) . In the context of DNA vaccines, lipid-DNA complexes have been successfully delivered to the lungs of monkeys (101) .

There are several reports that adequately proved applications of VLPs as a vaccine carrier, and also their ability to stimulate the host immune responses (113-115). VLPs are composed of selfassembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes (115, 116) . Interestingly, VLPs can also be engineered to express additional proteins either by fusion of proteins with the particles or by endogenous expression of multiple antigens (113, 117) . It is also possible to chemically couple non-protein antigens and small organic molecules onto the viral surface to produce bioconjugates with VLPs (118, 119) . Due to these distinct features, VLPs can provide protection not only against virus, but also against heterologous antigens (116) . A specific immune response was successfully generated after the delivery of an antigen using virus capsid protein SV40 in mammalian cells (120) . VLPs were also found to increase the immunogenicity of weak antigens. For example Salmonella typhi membrane antigen, influenza A M2 protein and H1V1 Nef gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) assembled VLPs produced strong antigen specific humoral as well as cellular immune responses (121, 122) . It is presumed that the use of VLP based nanoformulations could enable the antigens to achieve conformations resembling to native antigen structure, thus it may result in better stimulation of the host immune response (122) .

Dendrimers are three dimensional, mono-dispersed and hyperbranched nano structures that are made up of a mixture of amines and amides. Few studies have explored the application of dendrimers in the delivery of different antigenic molecules. The most commonly used dendrimers for vaccine delivery are polypropyleneimine (PPI) and polyamido amine (PAMAM) dendrimers. A single dose of dendrimer encapsulated multiple antigens was found to produce strong antibody and T-cell responses against Ebola virus, H1N1 influenza, and Toxoplasma gondii (123) . This generation of robust immune response was found to be due to efficient uptake of dendrimers by the host cells. Similarly a significant increase in the vaccine efficacy of HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) based DNA vaccine was observed due to enhanced cellular uptake of PMAM dendrimer (124) . Hence, the possibility to tailor the dendrimers to attain certain biological and physico-chemical properties, and also the feasibility to conjugate several ligands to the single molecule have made dendrimers promising candidates for the development of new generation vaccines with enhanced immunogenic properties.

Cytokines are known as important signaling molecules secreted by different cells in response to external stimuli. Some of the cytokines are able to activate immune cells to generate protective immunity against several diseases. However, cytokines are mostly susceptible to early degradation that subdue their participation in the generation of host immunity. Moreover, uncontrolled release of cytokines as immune responders may sometimes lead to harmful side effects (125) . To overcome these limitations, several studies have attempted to synthesize engineered nanocarriers to achieve effective and controlled delivery of cytokines to the target sites. This approach was found to reduce their toxicity, improve circulation time and antigen specific T-cell responses in comparison to free cytokines (126, 127) . Incorporation of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon alpha (IFN-α) into nano-carriers exhibited great application in cancer therapy (128, 129) . Nano-carrier conjugated cytokines also showed great potential in the treatment of infectious diseases. For example, IL-12 encapsulated microspheres induced strong protective immunity against tuberculosis (130) . This effect was due to production of high antibody titers as a result of sustained and controlled release of IL-12 from the microspheres in immunized mice (130) .

Like cytokines, several toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists were also explored as immune activators to augment immune surveillance mechanisms. Different immune effector cells such as macrophages, B-cells and DCs express different types of TLRs, which are known to interact with specific pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These specific interactions eventually initiate downstream signaling cascades to ensure the elimination or generation of immunity against pathogens (131, 132) . Conjugation of TLR specific agonists on nanocarriers helps to target the molecules to specific immune cells and therefore reduce the possibility of systemic biodistribution. One such study has shown that conjugation of TLR-7/8 agonist on nano polymers caused efficient internalization by APCs and also prolonged the T cell responses (133) . Administration of NPs loaded with vaccine peptide antigen and TLR-7 and 9 ligands were also found to induce strong memory and effector CD8 + T-cell response (134) . Another study has shown that conjugation of TLR-8 agonist to a polymer nanocarrier increased activation and maturation of naive DCs due to selective endocytosis and prolonged release of an immunogen by the nanocarrier inside DCs (135) . Moreover, intradermal injection of CpG and antigen encapsulated polymeric NPs were rapidly drained into the lymph nodes to activate DCs (97) . These studies indicate that NPs can be used as a tool to appropriately target presentation of antigens to T and B-cell rich lymphoid organs.

The genetic molecules such as DNA, plasmids and RNA can also act as immuno-stimulants. Due to these characteristics, in addition to less risk to cause disease particularly in immunocompromised individuals, these genetic materials are considered as promising candidates for the development of next generation vaccines. After administration, the plasmid vector translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of recombinant genes using the host cellular machinery. A recombinant DNA segment encoding HspX-PPE44-esxV fusion antigen of M. tuberculosis showed great potential as a new tuberculosis DNA vaccine candidate (136) . A similar type of study has been conducted in the past where the vaccination of DNA or RNA constructs expressing mycobacterium antigens were capable of inducing humoral as well as cellular immune responses (137) . Likewise, plasmids harboring genes encoding for viral antigen have been encapsulated into alginate nanocarriers and targeted against viral infections (138) .

In order to improve their delivery and vaccine characteristics, different approaches have been practiced to conjugate vaccine molecules to different nanocarriers. Vaccine molecules can be surface conjugated, encapsulated or surface adsorbed with the nanocarriers. Antigen adsorption on the nanocarrier is simply based on the presence of a charge or hydrophobic interactions between NPs and the candidate molecule (139, 140) . This type of interaction is usually non-covalent, which may lead to rapid dissociation of antigens from nanocarriers depending upon the external milieu such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and the antigen hydrophobicity. On the other hand, encapsulation and chemical conjugation of antigen to nanocarriers is more stable due to strong interactions and chemical bond formation between the target molecule and the nanocarrier. Further, antigens can also be encapsulated into nanocarriers by simple mixing reaction during the synthesis. In this case, the antigens are released only after partial or complete dissociation of the nanocarrier (141) . These processes have already been used with silica and gold NPs (142) . Similarly, chitosan and dextran sulfate NPs were used for the preparation of cationic and anionic antigenic formulations. Some viral antigens are known to bind to both positive as well as negative charged NPs through immobilization process and hydrogen bonds (143) . The immobilization process depends on the charge, pH, ratio of NPs and antigens, and the protein partition coefficient between the solution and the colloid (143) . Several antigens were successfully delivered to the target sites by chemical conjugation, adsorption and encapsulation to soft nanocarriers like VLPs, liposomes and immune stimulating complexes (ISCOM) (144) (145) (146) (147) . ISCOMs are a class of adjuvant formulations that consist of saponins, cholesterol and phospholipids in specific ratios. Antigens can be formulated into ISCOMs directly (148) or after the surface modification (149, 150) . Since ISCOM particles are negatively charged, direct conjugation of most of the soluble proteins is a limiting factor. Nanocarriers can augment immunogenicity of a molecule. For example, influenza antigen H1N1 conjugated chitosan NPs and Yersinia pestis F1-antigen coated gold NPs (AuNPs) produced higher levels of antibody and cytokine responses in comparison to mice administered with unconjugated antigens (151) .This was found to be due to stabilization and increased immunogenicity of vaccine antigens due to conjugation with NPs. Another important aspect in the development of nanoimmuno formulations is that they improve antigen delivery and presentation (152) . In this context, NP shape, size and surface charge are key factors that affect NP circulation, biodistribution, bioavailability and specificity by crossing biological barriers. Besides these factors, particle geometry such as surface to volume ratio plays an important role in the determination of immunogen release and degradation kinetics (153, 154) . Here, the importance of different physicochemical parameters such as size, shape, surface area, porosity, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and crystallinity in the interaction between NPs and the target cell is discussed.

The size of NPs determines the mode of cellular uptake and specificity (155, 156) . PLGA NPs of large size (1, 7 and 17 µm) showed reduced internalization rate in comparison to smaller NPs (300 nm) (157) . The size of NPs also determines the cellular specificity and migration. Smaller NPs (20-200 nm) were readily endocytosed by the resident DCs, whereas larger size (500-2,000 nm) NPs were effectively taken up by the migratory DCs (158) . NPs of less than 200 nm size were drained into the lymph nodes (159) , while particles up to 20 nm range were suitably transported to the APCs (152, 160) . Notably, NP curvature also affects the cellular interaction and phagocytosis rate (161) . NPs of 150 nm diameter and 450 nm height showed more cellular uptake as compared to the particles having 1,200 × 200 nm size. Of note the size of NPs was also found to influence the activation of signaling pathways. A study has demonstrated that smaller NPs are able to alter the cell signaling processes more efficaciously than the large NPs (31).

Vaccine loaded NPs can also be targeted to specific sites by modifying the NP surface charge. Delivery of such NPs at appropriate sites elicit strong immune responses against antigens. NP surface charge is responsible for the interaction with congnate surface molecules present on the target cells. This was exemplified from the observation that cationic polysterene NPs were efficiently internalized by the APCs in comparison to neutral surface charged NPs. This may be due to electrostatic interactions between the cationic NPs with anionic cell membranes (162, 163) . Interestingly, pulmonary instillation of cationic and anionic NPs showed similar endocytosis rate in macrophages and draining lymph nodes, however cationic formulations showed more expression of Ccl2 and Cxc10 chemokines that caused more recruitment and maturation of CD11b DCs in comparison to anionic NPs in the lung (125, 156) . Similarly, neutral silica-silane shell polymer NPs were less effective in the activation of innate immune cells (128) . These studies clearly indicate appropriate surface modifications of NPs may help to generate stronger immunological responses against specific infection.

Beside size and surface charge, NP shape is also a critical determinant in the cellular interaction, intracellular trafficking and the rate of antigen release inside the host cells (79, 141) . Spherical gold NPs were actively internalized by bone marrow derived dendritic cells in comparison to rod shaped particles of similar dimensions (33, 34), and that spherical NPs were able to induce strong immune response than cube or rod shaped NPs (164) . Another study reported that worm-like particles were impaired in phagocytosis as compared to spherical NPs (151) . These distinctions were ascribed to the differences in contact area between NPs and the target cell membrane. The shape of NPs also determines the localization of NPs inside the host cells. This was demonstrated by the fact that although nano rods and nano sheets were internalized via clathrin mediated endocytosis, nano rods were particularly delivered to the nucleus while nanosheet were retained in the cytoplasm (146, 147, 155) . This is an important aspect in the context of improving antigen processing and presentation to T-cells. It is well established that enhanced antigen processing and presentation can be achieved if the candidate molecules are delivered to the lysosomal compartment of the cells.

Hydrophobicity of NPs plays a significant role in the interaction with soluble proteins and immune cells through recognition of hydrophobic moieties (165) . Previous studies have shown that hydrophobic polymeric NPs are strong inducers of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules than hydrophilic polymeric NPs (53, 105, 166) . Exposure to hydrophobic NPs showed enhanced activation of DCs by inducing the expression of CD86 costimulatory molecules when compared with hydrophilic ones. Similar observations were reported in other innate immune cells, in which hydrophobic NPs were able to activate these cells by up-regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokine encoding genes (102) , and also facilitated opsonization process by increasing the adsorption of immunoglobulins on the cell surfaces (103) . However, other studies have reported that polyethylene glycol coating (PEGylation) reduced the interaction of NPs with immune receptors (50, 80). This property is considered useful in the prevention of non-specific adsorption of proteins on NPs and thereby prevent their up-take by APCs (50). Such non-specific adsorption of proteins and their uptake by phagocytic cells can also be preventing by the incorporation of an alkyl linker between the PEG and thiol moieties on NPs (80).

Surface modification of NPs alters ligand specificity and interaction with APCs (160) . Conjugation of CD47 molecules on the surface of NPs modulated the down-stream signaling cascades and also reduced NP internalization by phagocytic cells (131) . Functionalization of NPs with TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 agonists increased cytokine production and the expression of immunoregulatory genes (132) (133) (134) . Similarly, conjugation of poly (methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride; PVMA), TLR2, and TLR4 agonists, and galactose polymer to NPs were shown to activate the complement pathway as a result of stable binding to C3b complement factor (139, 142) . Further, lipoproteinlike NPs showed LPS scavenging activity, thereby resulting in the inhibition of TLR-4 dependent inflammatory responses (140) . Overall, these studies strongly demonstrated that tuning of physico-chemical properties of NPs could be used as a fundamental tool to target vaccine molecules to specific sites to induce desired immune responses.

Emerging studies have proved that nanocarriers can be useful mediators in the development of vaccines against various diseases. In this context, it is important to develop NP formulations that can deliver immunogens to APCs especially DCs to induce effective antigen-specific T-cell responses (Figure 2 ). Several nanocarriers have been shown to specifically activate DCs to effectuate anti-tumor or anti-viral immune responses (167) (168) (169) (170) . Zhu et al. proposed that nano-TiO 2 and Fe 3 O 4 -TiO 2 particles could function as a useful vector to promote vaccine delivery in immune cells (168) . Coincubation of nano-TiO 2 and Fe 3 O 4 -TiO 2 with DCs resulted in an increased production of TNF-α, and also upregulated the expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC class II molecules through the NF-κB signaling pathway (163) . In this way, immunization efficacy of various NP formulations such as erythrocyte membrane-enveloped poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs for antigenic peptide (hgp10025-33) and TLR-4 agonist, VLPs expressing RSV glycoproteins, chitosancoated EphrinA1-PE38/GM-CSF, and several others have been improved (171) (172) (173) (174) (175) (176) (177) . NPs can also control cell polarization and differentiation. Branched polyethylenimine-superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (bPEI-SPIONs) promoted Th1 polarization of DCs (178) . Another study by Sehgal et al. showed that NPs can also be used to target subsets of particular immune cells. They have shown that simultaneous targeting of DC subsets (i.e., DC-SIGN+ and BDCA3+DC) by NPs synergistically stimulated the activation of T cell-mediated immunity when compared with targeting of each DC subset separately (170) .

Macrophages and monocytes are highly heterologous cells that are distributed throughout the body. Macrophages process and present the antigens to elicit adaptive immune response. Due to their intrinsic phagocytic nature, macrophages can be easily targeted by surface engineered NPs, in which cognate ligands agonist to macrophage receptors can be conjugated on the NP surface (Figure 1 ). As discussed above several physicochemical parameters of NPs such as size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, surface topography, and material composition can be optimized to facilitate the interactions between NPs and macrophage receptors (184) (185) (186) . The rate of NP endocytosis also depends upon the type of cell surface receptors and the ligand conjugated to the NP surface. For example, NPs targeted via mannose and Fc receptors were rapidly internalized as compared to scavenger receptors (187) . Endocytosis of IgG and anti-F4/80 antibody coated NPs showed more uptake rate and retention time inside the macrophages without affecting the cell viability (188, 189) . Also, positively charged NPs interact more strongly with negatively charged phospholipid components of the cell membrane (190) . Hyperactivation of some inflammatory cells can also be restricted through controlled release of stimulants using NPs. Upon activation, neutrophils can secrete variety of cytokines and hydrolytic enzymes in response to infection (191) . Prolonged neutrophil activation often leads to acute inflammation and tissue damage at the localized site. Therefore, controlled release of molecules is necessary to prevent the hyperactivation and massive recruitment of neutrophils. It has been reported that bovine serum albumin (BSA) NPs were able to modulate the functions of neutrophils following their internalization. Intravenous injection of antiinflammatory peptide encapsulated polymeric NPs reduced neutrophil recruitment and subsequently hyperinflammation to prevent further tissue damage (192) . The use of NPs to deliver vaccine/drugs in a controlled fashion is now considered as an attractive approach to develop therapeutic strategies against a range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (193) .

T and B-cells of the adaptive immune system express a repertoire of receptors to recognize a range of antigens. Activation or suppression of T-cell immunity can determine the fate of a disease. A number of NP based therapeutic strategies have been developed to regulate T-cell activity against viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. For example, antiviral siRNA or retroviral drug encapsulated lipid NPs or dendrimers were effectively delivered to CD4 + T-cells to block HIV replication. This caused a significant reduction in HIV titer when compared with the use of non-encapsulated retroviral drugs (191, 194) . T-cell activation also depends up on the type and size of NP used for the delivery of antigen. Liposome encapsulated antigens were better presented to CD4 + T cells by APCs (195, 196) and delivery of 200 nm ova conjugated NPs increased MHC class I and II expression and also produced a higher percentage of antigen specific CD4 + T cells as compared to 30 nm ova conjugated particles (197) .

B cells are able to recognize and respond to the microbial surface antigens through B-cell receptors (198) . Activation and clonal expansion of antigen specific B-cells using engineered NPs have been exploited for the development of vaccines against different diseases (Figure 2) . Encapsulation of antigen in virus like particles (VLPs) was able to induce strong and durable humoral responses when compared with the administration of exposed vaccine molecules (199) . The potency of immune responses also depends upon the mode of antigen presentation to the target cells. Surface conjugated immunogenic proteins and peptides were able to activate B cells much stronger than encapsulated antigens (200) . A single dose of PLGA NPs with surface displayed ovalbumin (OVA) elicited strong antibody responses in vivo as compared to free OVA (201, 202) . NPs can also be used to activate specific immune responses. A study has shown that peptide conjugated carbon nanotubes showed significant antigen specific IgG response in comparison to peptide or adjuvant alone (83) .

In general, antigens captured by APCs from the extracellular environment are targeted to the endo-lysosomal compartments, where they are first processed into peptides and then loaded onto class II MHC molecules before presentation to CD4 + helper T cells. However, cytosolic antigens are loaded on MHC class I molecules and presented to CD8 + T-cells, which are crucial for the clearance of viral and intracellular infections (203) . It is reported that some fraction of antigens delivered through NPs are trafficked to cytosolic vacuoles of APCs and presented by MHC class I molecules (203) (204) (205) . The NP mediated cross antigen presentation was first demonstrated in antigens conjugated to iron oxide polymer NPs (206) (207) (208) (209) . In addition, inorganic and polymeric NPs have also been used for antigen delivery to cytosol (210) (211) (212) . In this context, lipid NPs were shown to induce CD8 + T cell expansion by efficient antigen cross presentation against viral infection in in-vivo models (102, 213) . Similarly, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT), which are a special subset of T-cells, recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d cells. PLGA NPs conjugated with α-galactosylceramide glycolipid, an iNKT cell stimulant, increased cytokine release as well as expansion of antigen specific CD8+ T cells (214) . The cross antigen presentation also depends upon the particle-antigen linkages. It has been shown that disulfide bonding between NP and antigens caused release of antigens into the endosomal compartment and also enhanced CD8 + T cell formation as compared to non-degradable linkers (215, 216) . Similarly, pulmonary administration of NPs efficiently enhanced cross antigen presentation, which resulted in at least 10-fold more effector CD8 + T cells in lungs (217) .

Adjuvants are known to enhance and prolong the immune responses against antigens. Delivery of adjuvants and antigens using NPs have been found useful to prolong their exposure in the lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes to generate robust immune responses. This is especially important for small adjuvant molecules, which are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream. NPs with a size ranging from 10-100 nm can penetrate the extracellular matrix and travel to the lymph nodes where they can be internalized by the resident macrophages to activate T-cell responses (218) (219) (220) . The bio-distribution of NPs also depends upon the route of administration and size. It was observed that larger particles accumulated near the site of NPs and were subsequently endocytosed by the local APCs (160) , whereas the smaller NPs drained to the blood capillaries (158, 218) . PEG coated liposomes of 80-90 nm diameter showed higher accumulation in lymph nodes after subcutaneous administration as compared to intravenous and intraperitoneal administration (221) .

The nano-immuno formulations can improve the antigen stability, targeted delivery and also enhance their immunogenicity properties. Most soluble antigens cannot be efficiently endocytosed by the APCs and hence are poorly effective in inducing protective immunity. The immunogenicity of such soluble vaccine antigens can be improved by conjugating them with nanocarriers that can facilitate the recognition and uptake by APCs. This strategy has already been proved effective for inducing/increasing the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic antigens, such as polysaccharides of pneumococcal vaccines (222) . In the last few years, the application of nanotechnology in the field of immune engineering is growing rapidly with a number of new carrier synthesis strategies. Furthermore, novel nano formulations also contain immunostimulatory molecules to enhance the adjuvant properties of the nanoparticles. Co-encapsulation of the TLR agonists [e.g., CpG, poly(I:C)] (77) or imiquimoid (78) into dextran or chitosan NPs, respectively enhanced receptor-based recognition of the nanovaccines with subsequent cell activation. The recent study by Margaroni et al. showed that vaccination with poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide; PLGA) nanoparticles with Leishmania infantum antigens (sLiAg) and surface-modified with a TNFα-mimicking eight-amino-acid peptide (p8) induced significant protection against parasite infection in BALB/c mice accompanied by activation of CD8+ T cells and increase in IFNγ production (223) .

Additionally, NPs can be tailored for non-invasive administration and prolonged delivery of the vaccine antigens to a specific location, thus providing the possibility for formulation of the single dose vaccine. Several studies clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the non-invasively administered vaccines such as intranasal application of influenza nano vaccine (224) , chitosan NPs with hemagglutinin protein of H1N1 influenza virus (225) , Streptococcus equi proteins (226), hepatitis B surface antigen (pRc/CMV-HBs) (227) and plasmid encoding a multi-epitope protein against M. tuberculosis (pHSP65pep) (228) or antigen 85B (229) were used to provide protective immunity against infections. These considerations can improve the progress of ongoing strategies in the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines. In future, development of nanovaccines will address not only the possibility to induce the immune response but also the anti-infective therapeutic activity of NPs thus representing the feasibility to apply multifunctional particles for the treatment of diseases.

Virology Journal Prophylactic and therapeutic activity of fully human monoclonal antibodies directed against Influenza A M2 protein,"Influenza virus infection is a prevalent disease in humans. Antibodies against hemagglutinin have been shown to prevent infection and hence hemagglutinin is the major constituent of current vaccines. Antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of M2 have also been shown to mediate protection against Influenza A infection in various animal models. Active vaccination is generally considered the best approach to combat viral diseases. However, passive immunization is an attractive alternative, particularly in acutely exposed or immune compromized individuals, young children and the elderly. We recently described a novel method for the rapid isolation of natural human antibodies by mammalian cell display. Here we used this approach to isolate human monoclonal antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of the Influenza A M2 protein. The identified antibodies bound M2 peptide with high affinities, recognized native cell-surface expressed M2 and protected mice from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Moreover, therapeutic treatment up to 2 days after infection was effective, suggesting that M2-specific monoclonals have a great potential as immunotherapeutic agents against Influenza infection.","Influenza A virus still is a major cause of disease in humans, accounting for three to five million cases of severe illness and 250,000 -500,000 deaths each year [1] . Efficient influenza A vaccines are available, which induce antibodies predominantly against the two major components of the virus membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuramidase (NA). Protection is mediated primarily by neutralizing antibodies against HA [2, 3] . Since HA undergoes continuous change due to mutations (antigenic drift), new antigenic variants of influenza A arise every year requiring constant update of the vaccines. Effective vaccination is further complicated by the occasional reassortment of the segmented viral genome leading to the replacement of HA or NA from one subtype by another subtype, a processs called antigenic shift [4] . Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HA is very efficient [5] [6] [7] , however, suffers the same disadvantages as the current vaccines due to antigenic shift and drift.

An ideal target for active and passive immunization strategies would therefore be a conserved viral protein. The matrix protein 2 (M2) fits the bill and has received considerable attention as a potential target against influenza infection over the past decades [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . M2 is a tetrameric ion channel [24] [25] [26] which is involved in virus uncoating in the endosome and in virus maturation in the trans-Golgi network [27] [28] [29] . Its 23 amino acid extracellular domain has remained remarkably conserved in human influenza A virus isolates over the last hundred years [30] , at least in part due to the fact that the M2 protein is cotranscribed with the matrix protein 1 (M1) [31, 32] . Whereas M2 is abundantly expressed on infected cells, only very few M2 molecules are present in Influenza A virus membranes [23, 26] . In accordance with this, current seasonal influenza vaccines do not induce a significant humoral resonse against M2, and M2 specific antibodies (administered intravenously or induced by active immunization) mediate protection not by neutralizing virions, but by eliminating infected cells by ADCC [15, 22] .

Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies has several advantages over vaccination. In particular, it allows treating people which poorly respond to vaccines, such as the elderly, young children or immune compromised individuals. In addition, passive immunisation is the treatment option of choice in situations where rapid protection is crucial, such as for post-exposure treatment or prophylaxis for the acutely exposed. A number of M2 ectodomain (M2e)-specific mAbs have been reported to protect mice from a lethal challenge in a prophylactic setting [12, 17, [21] [22] [23] . While these mAbs include fully human antibodies derived from transchromosomic mice [22] , no natural human M2e-specific antibodies have been reported to date. However, for application in human subjects, natural human antibodies are the preferred choice. In contrast to humanized and fully human antibodies derived from phage display or transchromosomic mice, natural human antibodies combine the advantage of minimal immunogenicity with the smallest possible off-target reactivity and toxicity. Furthermore, human derived antibodies have the advantage of having gone through the affinity maturation process, resulting in high affinity antibodies.

We recently described a novel method for the efficient isolation of antibodies from humans by mammalian cell display [33] . Here, we used this method for the isolation of natural human antibodies directed against M2e. We demonstrate that the antibodies bind M2 with high affinity and efficiently recognize M2 from a recently isolated H5N1 influenza A strain. The antibodies not only have potent prophylactic activities in a mouse model of Influenzy A infection, but also show efficacy in a therapeutic setting. Thus, the natural human antibodies described here have potential as immunotherapeutics against influenza infection.

Human mAbs were isolated by Sindbis-mediated mammalian cell display [33] . First, 334 M2e-specific B cells were isolated by FACS from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an individual with high M2e titers, using the M2e consensus peptide (M2e-cons) ( Table  1 ) conjugated to the virus-like particle Qβ as a bait. The immunoglobulin variable regions (VRs) of the heavy chains (HCs) and light chains (LCs) were then amplified by RT-PCR and assembled to single-chain antibody (scFv) coding regions. Two separate libraries, one encoding scFv antibodies with κ, the other with λ LCVRs, were cloned in the Sindbis cell surface display vector pDel-SP-TM [33] . The resulting scFv-κ and scFv-λ sublibraries consisted of 1.0 × 10 6 and 1.1 × 10 6 independent transformants, respectively. Since the library was derived from 334 cells, it may be expected that every possible combination of heavy and light chain is covered multiple times by the 2 million clones and, accordingly, that screening is likely to yield antibodies containing the natural heavy and light chain pairs. Recombinant Sindbis virus libraries were then generated with titers of 3.4 × 10 7 pfu/ml and 5.7 × 10 7 pfu/ ml, respectively, and used to infect BHK cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), to ascertain expression of a single antibody species per infected cell.

Cells were stained for cell surface expression of M2-specific scFv using RNAse-M2e-cons or Qβ-M2e-cons conjugates and subjected to FACS. No M2e-specific antibodies could be found on the surface of BHK cells infected with the scFv-λ sublibrary. In contrast, BHK cells infected with the scFv-κ sublibrary contained a substantial fraction of M2e-reactive cells (typically about 0.3% of infected cells). Three sorts were carried out with the scFv-κ library, two using Qβ-M2e-cons (not shown) and one using RNase-M2e-cons as bait ( Figure 1A ), leading to the isolation of 255 BHK cells each displaying an M2e-specific antibody. Single cells were sorted into wells containing BHK feeder cells and incubated for 2 to 3 days to allow for amplification of the corresponding Sindbis virus clone. In total, 201 of the 255 wells showed signs of viral infection and were reanalyzed for M2e binding, using RNase-M2e-cons as a bait ( Figure 1B ). 130 cells showing varying degrees of M2e binding were identified. Supernatants from wells containing infected BHK cells displaying highly M2e-reac-tive scFv were used to clone the corresponding scFv coding region by RT-PCR. The large number of specific antibodies isolated in a single screen not only illustrates the utility of mammalian cell display [33] , but also makes it an attractive alternative to other methods, typically based on cloning of antibodies from single or amplified B cell clones [34, 35] , or from EBV-immortalized memory B cells [36] .

Since the protective potential of M2e-specific antibodies depends on ADCC [15] , the scFv antibodies were fused to the Fc region of mouse IgG2c (msFc-γ2c), allowing in vivo efficacy testing in a mouse model of influenza. All scFv-msFc-γ2c fusion proteins were expressed in HEK 293T cells, using an Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-based episomal expression vector. Binding of scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies to M2e was confirmed by ELISA, using supernatants from transiently transfected cells (not shown). Clones D005, E040 and F052 were selected for further analysis, expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified by affinity chromatography. The three antibodies were expressed at high levels, with yields of 20 to 40 mg per liter. These yields are in the same range as the ones we previously reported for Qβ-and Nicotine-specific human antibodies [33] , demonstrating that the mammalian cell display method con- 

sistently yields antibodies that are highly expressed in mammalian cells.

We next determined the affinity of D005, E040, and F052 for M2e. To this end, the dissociation constants (Kd) of antibody binding to M2e-cons in solution were determined using an ELISA-based method [37] (Figure 2A) . The scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies were found to bind M2econs peptide with high affinity, with Kd values of 4-5 nM (Figure 2A ).

In a next set of experiments the ability of the antibodies to cross-react with a peptide covering M2e from a recent Influenza A H5N1 isolate (A/VN/1203/2004) was assessed by ELISA. The sequence of the peptide used for coating (M2e-VN) is shown in Table 1 . Thus, ELISA plates were coated with M2e-cons or M2e-VN peptide conjugated to RNAse A, and serial dilutions of the different scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies were applied. Significantly, each of the antibodies bound both peptides to a similar extent, with EC50 values of 5-10 ng/ml (45-90 pM), indicating that they efficiently crossreact with H5N1-derived M2e.

Finally, binding of the antibodies to native, cell surface M2 was investigated ( Figure 2C ). To this end, a clone of L929 cells expressing full-length M2 derived from Influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was generated (L929-M2#E9). The sequence for the extracellular domain of the M2 is shown in Table 1 (M2e-PR). The cells were stained with Binding properties of M2e-specific scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies increasing concentrations of D005, E040 or F052. A concentration-dependent staining of the cells was observed, demonstrating that each of the antibodies is capable of recognizing cellular, native M2 protein. In agreement with the ELISA results, the three antibodies showed similar binding to L929 cells expressing M2.

We next explored the clinical potential of the antibodies by investigating their protective activity in an in vivo model of influenza A infection. This model reflects most aspects of Influenza infection in humans and is therefore routinely used to assess the efficacy of anti-viral agents. Groups of mice were passively immunized i.p. with 500 μg scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies D005, E040 or F052, while a control group received the same amount of mouse IgG. Two days later, animals were infected intranasally with a lethal dose (4 × LD50) of mouse adapted (m.a.) influenza A/PR/8/34 and monitored for morbidity and mortality ( Figure 3 ). Control mice treated with mouse IgG showed a dramatic drop in body temperature and substantial weight loss within few days after infection and and had to be euthanized on days 7 or 8 due to the severity of the symptoms ( Figure 3C ). In contrast, all animals that had been treated with M2-specific antibodies survived the lethal challenge, hardly developed any fever and only displayed a transient weight loss (Figure 3A and 3B) .

We next set out to determine the amount of antibody required to achieve protection in a prophylactic setting in mice. To this end, groups of mice were treated with decreasing amounts of scFv-msFc-γ2c D005 or, as a control, with 200 μg of mouse IgG. Two days later, animals were infected with a lethal dose of m.a. influenza A/PR/8/ 34 and monitored for 21 days ( Figure 4A ). As expected, control mice quickly succumbed to the infection and all had to be euthanized due to the severity of the disease within less than two weeks after challenge. In contrast, all animals that had received at least 20 μg of D005 antibody survived the challenge. Even at the lowest dose of 6 μg D005, half of the mice recovered and survived infection, indicating that the M2-specific antibody is a potent prophylactic agent.

In view of the potent prophylactic activity of D005, the antibody's ability to control an established viral infection was tested next ( Figure 4B ). Thus, groups of mice were infected with a lethal dose of m.a. influenza A/PR/8/34 and treated with a single injection of 200 μg scFv-msFc-γ2c D005 1, 2 or 3 days after challenge. Animals treated with 200 μg D005 or mouse IgG two days prior to the infection served as positive and negative controls respec-tively. In accordance with the results above all mice treated with the control antibody succumbed to the disease, whereas all mice that had received the D005 antibody prophylactically survived the lethal challenge. Importantly, almost all animals which had been treated therapeutically within two days after infection survived the challenge. Even animals that had been treated 3 days post infection appeared to withstand the infection longer than the control group.

Recently, the M2-specific human antibody Z3G1 has been reported to show therapeutic activity in mice [22] . However, multiple injections of Z3G1 starting as early as 5 h after infection were required for full protection. Antibody D005 compares favorably to this, since it was fully protective with a single injection at day 1 and still showed some protection when administered 3 days after challenge. Taken together, these data indicate that treatment with antibody D005, in addition to its potential as pre-exposure prophylaxis, may also be used therapeutically at the early stages of infection.

Given the intended use of the M2e-specific antibody in humans, D005 was produced as a fully human IgG1 in 293T cells using an EBV-based episomal expression system. Similar to the scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies, IgG1-D005 was expressed at high levels in mammalian cells and yielded approximately 70 mg per liter culture supernatant. To evaluate its protective activity in the influenza A mouse model, IgG-D005 was compared to its scFv-msFc-γ2c counterpart. Thus, groups of mice were treated with equimolar amounts of IgG1-D005, scFv-D005-msFc-γ2c, or human IgG. Two days later, animals were infected with a lethal dose of influenza A/PR/8/34 and closly monitored for 16 days ( Figure 5 ). Mice treated with control human IgG displayed a dramatic drop in body temperature and weight loss and had to be euthanized between 8 and 11 days after infection due the severity of the symptoms. In contrast, all animals treated with M2-specific antibodies survived the lethal challenge, hardly experienced any fever and showed only a transient drop in body weight. Thus, D005 was protective both as a scFv-msFc-γ2c fusion protein and as a fully human IgG1, indicating that the human antibody was able to recruit effector functions in the mouse system and that IgG-D005 may be used as a valuable prophylactic or therapeutic agent in humans.

Human antibodies specific for the Influenza A M2 protein were isolated and shown to have potent prophylactic and therapeutic activity in a mouse model. This underscores the utility of Sindbis-based mammalian cell display for the isolation of natural human antibodies with therapeutic potential.

Effect of M2-specific scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies on Influenza-induced morbidity and mortality Figure 3 Effect of M2-specific scFv-msFc-γ2c antibodies on Influenza-induced morbidity and mortality. Mice were treated with 500 μg of the indicated antibody on day -2, infected with Influenza A virus PR8 on day 0, and body temperature (A), weight (B) and survival (C) were monitored over time. 

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 10 ml of heparinized blood by Ficoll gradient. PBMC were pre-incubated with Alexa 647 nm-labeled Qβ and human gamma globulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then stained with: (1) M2e coupled to Qβ in combination with a Alexa 488 nm-labeled Qβ-specific mouse mAb, as well as the M2-specific mouse mAb 14C2 (Abcam) in combination with FITC-labeled donkey antimouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch); (2) PElabeled mouse anti-human IgM, mouse anti-human IgD, mouse anti-human CD14, and mouse anti-human CD3 antibodies (all BD Biosciences/Pharmingen); and (3) A Sindbis virus-based scFv cell surface display library was produced from antigen-specific B cells as described [33] . BHK cells were infected with the Sindbis library and cells displaying M2-specific scFv antibodies were isolated using M2e coupled to RNase A in combination with an RNasespecific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam) and a FITClabeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immu-noResearch). Alternatively, cells displaying M2-specific scFv antibodies were isolated using Qβ-M2e in combination with M2-specific mouse mAb 14C2 (Abcam) and FITC-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Each cell was sorted into a well of a 24-well plate containing 50% confluent BHK feeder cells. Upon virus spread (2 days post sorting), the infected cells were tested by FACS analysis for M2-binding to identify virus clones encoding M2-specific scFv antibodies.

Fusion proteins were generated carrying an N-terminal human scFv fused to a C-terminal mouse Fc-γ2c domain. Thus, scFv coding regions were PCR amplified from Sindbis virus-containing supernatants by RT-PCR, digested with the restriction endonuclease Sfi1 and cloned into the expression vector pCEP-SP-Sfi-msFc-γ2c. This vector is a derivative of the episomal mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen), carrying the Epstein-Barr Virus replication origin (oriP) and nuclear antigen (encoded by the EBNA-1 gene) to permit extrachromosomal replication, and contains a puromycin selection marker in place of the original hygromycin B resistance gene. The resulting plasmids drive expression of scFv-msFc-γ2c fusion proteins under the control of a CMV promoter.

Fully human γ1 heavy chain and κ light chain coding regions were generated by total gene synthesis (GeneArt AG, Regensburg, Germany) and combined into the EBNAbased expression vector pCB15 essentially as described [33] .

Expression of the scFv-msFc-γ2c fusion proteins, as well as fully human IgG1κ antibody was done by transfecting the expression vectors into HEK-293T cells, using Lipofectamin Plus (Invitrogen). For large scale production and purification, stable protein-expressing cells were enriched by selection in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Pools of resistant cells were maintained in serum-free medium on Poly-L-Lysine coated dishes or in roller bottles for up to 3 weeks. Supernatants containing the respective antibodies were collected twice a week and filtered through a 0.22 μM Millex GV sterile filter (Millipore). Both types of antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography over a protein A-Sepharose column (GE healthcare).

ELISA plates (96 well MAXIsorb, NUNC) were coated with RNAse-M2e-cons or RNAse-M2e-VN at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6) for one hour at 37°C. The plates were then washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween) and blocked for 2 h at 37°C with 3% BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with 3-fold serial dilutions of scFv-msFc-γ2c in wash buffer containing 1% BSA. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then extensively washed with wash buffer. Specifically bound antibodies were then detected with HRPO-labeled, Fcγspecific, goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immu-noResearch Laboratories). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed with a 0.4 mg/ml solution of 1, 2-ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) in citric acid buffer (35 mM citric acid, 66 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 5.0) containing 0.01% H 2 O 2 . After 10 min the reaction was stopped with a 5% solution of H 2 SO 4 in H 2 O, and plates were read at 450 nm on an ELISA reader (Biorad Benchmark).

A 10 ng/ml solution of, respectively, scFv-D005-msFc-γ2c, scFv-E040-msFc-γ2c or scFv-F052-msFc-γ2c, was incubated in the presence of different concentrations of M2econs peptide (3-fold serial dilutions corresponding to 10 nM to 0.17 pM) in PBS/1% BSA. After 2 h at room temperature, free antibody was detected by a classical ELISA similar to the one described above. For this, ELISA plates that had been coated with RNAse-M2e-cons conjugate at a concentration of 20 ng/ml at 4°C overnight were washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween) and blocked for 2 h at 37°C with 3% BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with the solution binding reactions for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive washing with wash buffer, bound scFv-Fcγ2c fusion proteins were detected by a 1 h incubation at room temperature with a HRPO-labeled, Fcγ-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed as described above. The Kd values were determined as the EC50 of the ELISA signal as a function of the M2e-cons peptide concentration present in the solution binding reaction.

Prophylactic and therapeutic activity of antibodies was tested in a mouse model of Influenza A infection. Thus, six weeks old female C57BL/6 mice (6 per group) were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted (m.a.) influenza A virus PR8 (4 × LD50), followed by close monitoring of weight-loss and fever (twice daily at peak of infection). Antibodies were injected intraperitoneally either 2 days before (prophylactic setting) or 1 to 3 days after infection (therapeutic setting). One day later, mice were bled in order to verify the presence of the antibodies in the blood by ELISA (not shown). Antibodies were readily detectable in the sera of all mice, except for one mouse receiving 500 μg scFv-D005-msFc-γ2c ( Figure  3 ) and one mouse receiving 60 μg scFv-D005-msFc-γ2c ( Figure 4A ); these mice were subsequently removed from the analysis. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office. Animals whose body temperature reached 30°C were considered moribund and had to be euthanized immediately due to abortion criteria defined by the Veterinary Office.

Maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies reduce vaccine efficacy against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection,"Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used to reduce the impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) but limited efficacy is achieved in field conditions. Here, we evaluated the impact of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) on vaccine efficacy after PRRS virus (PRRSV) challenge. Piglets with low (AÀ) or high (A+) MDNA levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated (V+) or not (VÀ) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 3 weeks of age (woa). Because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in AÀV+ piglets post-vaccination (pv), all V+ piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa. Five weeks (W5) pv, piglets were inoculated with a PRRSV-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection, and were mingled 24 h later with noninoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission. Vaccine strain was detected at W2 pv in 69% and 6% of AÀV+ and A+V+ piglets, and at W5 pv in 50% and 25% of AÀV+ and A+V+ piglets, respectively. At W5 pv, 94% of AÀV+ and 44% of A+V+ piglets seroconverted, with a significant IFNg response induction in the AÀV+ group only. After challenge, compared to the VÀ inoculated group, viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in AÀV+ whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in A+V+ piglets. A lower transmission rate was estimated for the AÀV+ group: 0.15 [0.07-0.29] versus 0.44 [0.18-1.76] and 0.32 [0.14-0.68] for the A+V+ and VÀ groups, respectively. Investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between IFNa levels and vaccine strain detection in AÀV+ piglets. We showed that MDNAs impair vaccine efficacy against PRRSV both in inoculated and contact piglets, probably by reducing vaccine replication. IFNa may also interfere with PRRSV vaccination. These new data could help improving vaccination protocols.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by a small RNA virus, member of the Arteriviridae family [1] , is one of the most costly diseases in swine production world-wide [2, 3] . In Western Europe, PRRS virus 1 (PRRSV-1) is the main circulating PRRSV species. PRRSV infection is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and by respiratory disorders, growth retardation and increased mortality in growing pigs. PRRSV predis-poses pigs to secondary infections associated with the porcine respiratory disease complex [4] . To limit the impact of PRRS, modified live virus (MLV) vaccines based on cell culture attenuated PRRSV strains are routinely used in gilts, sows and growing pigs, but control of PRRS in the field is still a challenge. Only partial protection is achieved, mainly limiting the clinical signs and lesions [5] [6] [7] . However, in experimental conditions, these vaccines provide good protection against PRRSV challenge in piglets, controlling the viremia in infected pigs and decreasing transmission to contact pigs [8, 9] . Unlike to experimental conditions, in field conditions, vaccinated piglets are generally born to PRRSV infected, exposed or vaccinated sows since they are commonly vaccinated against PRRSV to prevent PRRSV circulation in farrowing units and improve farrowing https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.06.045 0264-410X/Ó 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. rates [10] . Consequently, high levels of maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) against PRRSV are frequently detected in piglets vaccinated at weaning [11] . Among MDAs, maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) can protect suckling piglets against PRRSV infection during their first weeks of life and prevent viremia in weaned piglets [12, 13] . However, we recently demonstrated a negative impact of MDNAs on PRRSV vaccination in piglets vaccinated at 3 weeks of age (woa) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine [14] . In this study, vaccine strain replication was impaired and both PRRSV antibody and IFNg-secreting cell production were inhibited for 4 weeks post-vaccination (pv) in piglets with high levels of MDNAs. This interference of MDNAs with postvaccination immune response suggested weak protection against PRRSV infection of piglets vaccinated in presence of high MDNA levels that could explain the lower vaccine efficacy observed in the field. Previous studies reported that vaccination in piglets with high MDA levels had no impact on vaccine efficacy but neutralizing antibodies (NAs) were not considered [15] . In the present study, piglets were vaccinated in the presence of low or high MDNA levels and further challenged with a wild PRRSV-1 to assess the impact of MDNAs on the efficacy of PRRSV-1 MLV vaccination.

The experiment was performed using 56 (Large White * Landrace) * Pietrain piglets selected in a conventional farrow-tofinish herd free from PRRSV circulation in growing pigs and sows but that maintains PRRS-1 MLV mass vaccination of sows with Porcilis PRRS (MSD, Beaucouzé, France) in order to keep a certain level of immunity in case of PRRSV reintroduction in the herd. Before starting the study, the absence of PRRSV circulation was individually checked by ELISA in pigs sampled at the end of the fattening period and by PCR in weaned piglets using sample pools of 5 animals. Piglets used in this study were born from 4 sows with high PRRSV NA titres and from 5 sows with low PRRSV NA titers. At 1 woa, blood was collected from piglets in order to assign them according to their PRRSV-specific MDNA level: A+ (high level, mean NA titre 201 ± 73) and AÀ (low level, mean NA titre 10 ± 5). At 3 woa, study piglets were weaned, transferred to the Anses biosafety level 3 animal facilities in Ploufragan and randomly distributed according to A+/AÀ status, weight and gender ( Fig. 1; 8 piglets per group). The absence of PRRSV infection in piglets at 3 woa was checked by RT-PCR using sample pools of 5 animals. The decay of MDA was then individually evaluated at 3 woa afterwards (A+: mean NA titer 10 ± 5; AÀ: no-longer detectable NA). Piglets were vaccinated (V+) or not (VÀ) twice at 3 and 4 woa using one dose of Porcilis PRRS vaccine (MSD, Beaucouzé, France) by intramuscular injection in the neck using a syringe with a needle 0.6 * 25 mm (vaccine lot No. A208DB01). At 5 weeks postfirst vaccination (W5 pv), half of the piglets were inoculated with 5Á10 5 TCID 50 /pig of the PRRSV-1 Finistere strain (PRRS-FR-2005-29-24-1) by nasal inoculation using a syringe without needle (2.5 mL per nostril). The day after, non-inoculated contact (C) piglets of the same immune status were mingled with inoculated (I) piglets in the same pens (2 C and 2 I piglets by pen). Eight unvaccinated and non-inoculated piglets (4 A+ and 4 AÀ) were assigned to control groups. Due to the waning of MDNA, at the time of PRRSV inoculation the A+ piglets from the VÀ and control groups had undetectable PRRS antibody levels (VNT and ELISA tests, data not shown). This identical immune status between A+ and AÀ allowed us to mingle the results of the A+ and AÀ piglets from VÀ and control groups for the post-inoculation period.

Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein once a week for 5 weeks pv to individually detect viremia and monitor humoral and cellular immune responses. After challenge, clinical signs were recorded daily and blood was collected twice a week until animals were euthanized at day 42 post-inoculation (D42 pi) to individually quantify the Finistere strain viremia and to evaluate the immune response. All experiments were authorized by the French 

PRRSV-specific NAs were quantified in serum on MARC145 cells targeting the vaccine strain, as previously described [14] .

Before challenge, the vaccine strain genome was detected using the Adiavet TM PRRS real-time RT-PCR kit (Adiagene, Saint-Brieuc, France). After challenge, specific detection of the Finistere strain genome was assessed by qRT-PCR, as described by Rose et al. [8] .

PRRSV-specific IFNg-secreting cells (IFNg-SCs) were quantified as previously described [14] , using 16 h PRRSV stimulation of 4 Â 10 5 PBMCs with a multiplicity of infection of 0.2 for either the vaccine strain or the Finistere strain. The number of spots per well was counted using an ImmunoSpot S5 UV Analyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA).

Antibodies against PRRSV were detected in serum using PRRS X3 Ab ELISA tests (IDEXX laboratories, Liebefeld, Switzerland). Sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios with values equal to or greater than 0.4 were considered positive.

Porcine IFNa was quantified in serum using an in-house ELISA test, as previously described [16] .

All the data and calculated areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). Post hoc pairwise comparisons were then performed using the Holm test to adjust the p-values of these comparisons according to the number of tests conducted (p < 0.05). The relationship between the blood genomic viral load and the number of IFNg-SCs for all the inoculated animals during the post-challenge follow-up period was assessed with a Spearman correlation test (p < 0.05).

The estimation of the transmission parameters was based on a SEIR model, where each individual was considered according to the virological results as susceptible (uninfected), exposed (infected without virus excretion), infectious (infected with virus excretion) or removed (protected without a role in the infectious process). The duration of the latency period and the transmission rate of the virus were estimated by Bayesian inference using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, as previously used [8] . Convergence was assessed by visual inspection and diagnostic tests (Gelman-Rubin, autocorrelation, Heidelberger).

At W1 pv, the vaccine strain was detected in only 2 out of 16 AÀV+ piglets ( Fig. 2A) . A second vaccination was thus performed at W1 pv in the same conditions as the first. At W2 pv, 11 out of 16 AÀV+ piglets (69%) were viremic, whereas only 1 out 16 (6%) were so in the A+V+ piglets. The difference between A+V+ and AÀV+ was maintained until W5 pv, with two-fold fewer viremic piglets in A+V+ compared to AÀV+ piglets ( Fig. 2A) . A significant IFNg response was observed at W3 pv and W5 pv for AÀV+ piglets, whereas for the A+V+ group, the number of IFNg-SCs was only significantly increased at W3 pv (Fig. 2B) . Regarding the seroconversion, all AÀV+ piglets except one showed a detectable PRRSV antibody level in serum at W5 pv (Fig. 2D) , while at the same time, only 7 out of 16 A+V+ piglets were seropositive (Fig. 2C ).

After PRRSV challenge, very mild clinical signs were observed. Unvaccinated inoculated (V-I) piglets showed a significant raise of rectal temperature at 3, 8 and 9 days post-challenge compared to unchallenged control piglets but no statistical difference was observed in growth performance ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In the vaccinated inoculated pigs, whatever their MDNA status (A+V+I and AÀV+I), no significant difference was observed with the V-I group for rectal temperature nor growth performance.

A lower Finistere strain viral load was detected for AÀV+I piglets compared to VÀI animals (AUC = 21.8 log10 equivalent TCID 50 / mL * week ± 7.8 and 53.0 log10 equivalent TCID 50 /mL * week ± 4.7 respectively; p = 0.003), with 100-fold lower values at D10 pi (p = 0.019) (Fig. 3A) . No difference was observed between the A +V+I and VÀI groups, or between vaccinated groups. Mean viremia duration was shortened from 21 ± 6 days for VÀI or 21 ± 7 days for A+V+I to 16 ± 9 days for AÀV+I animals, but not significantly.

Vaccination induced an early IFNg response against the Finistere strain at D7 pi in inoculated piglets for both the AÀV+ and A +V+ groups (Fig. 3B) . Even though more IFNg-SCs were detected in AÀV+I compared to A+V+I piglets, the difference was not significant. Interestingly, considering all inoculated pigs during the D7-D15 pi period, a negative correlation could be established between the number of IFNg-SC and the Finistere strain genomic load in serum (r = À0.55; p < 0.05). NAs were detected from D30 pi in inoculated pigs. At D42 pi, 6 out of 8 AÀV+I piglets had quantifiable NAs titres (>10) compared to 3 out of 8 for A+V+I and 1 out of 8 in V-I animals ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).

A reduction in viremia was observed in AÀV+ C contact pigs compared to V-C piglets (AUC = 30.3 log10 equivalent TCID 50 / mL * week ± 15.5 and 56.9 log10 equivalent TCID 50 / mL * week ± 10.3 respectively; p = 0.002), but not in A+V+C piglets (Fig. 3C) . At D7 pi, the Finistere strain was not yet detected in AÀV +C piglets, whereas the first positive piglets were identified at D4 pi in the other contact groups (Fig. 3D) . The mean viremia duration for AÀV+C was shortened to 6 ± 3 days compared to 12 ± 6 and 19 ± 6 days for the A+V+C and V-C groups, respectively. The Finistere strain was detected in all unvaccinated piglets. In vaccinated groups, all the contact animals became infected, except one A+V +C pig (Fig. 3D) .

The A+V+C piglet that remained uninfected had seroconverted post-vaccination. Considering this outlier animal as protected against PRRSV infection with no role in the transmission process, the estimates for the transmission rate of the A+V+ group was comparable to those of the VÀ group (0.44 [0.18; 1.76] and 0.32 [0.14; 0.68] for A+V+ and VÀ respectively; Table 1 ). For the AÀV+ group, the estimated transmission rate was reduced to 0.15 [0.07; 0.29].

In order to understand the unexpectedly low vaccine viremia detected in AÀ piglets after the first vaccination, the IFNa level was assessed in serum samples collected at W0 pv during the present experiment (Experiment B) and compared with those collected at the same time during our previous study [14] (Experiment A) where the vaccine viremia was detected in most of the AÀ animals after vaccination. The results showed significantly higher levels of IFNa for piglets in Experiment B than for those in Experiment A (Fig. 4A) . A relationship could be thus hypothesized between high IFNa levels detected at the time of vaccination and low subsequent vaccine strain detection (Fig. 4B ).

Vaccination programs hardly eradicate PRRSV circulation in farms whereas PRRS MLV showed a good efficacy in piglets to control PRRSV transmission in experimental conditions [5, 8] . In a previous study, we demonstrated an interference of MDNAs on postvaccine immune responses induction during 4 weeks postvaccination, suggesting a negative impact of MDNAs on vaccine efficacy in piglets [14] . To test this hypothesis, PRRSV-1 MLV vaccinated piglets with low or high levels of MDNAs were challenged with a field PRRSV-1 strain.

Despite the animals had to be vaccinated twice in the present study, vaccine viremia was detected in only one A+V+ piglet whereas it was detected in 11 AÀV+ piglets at W2 pv, which was in accordance with our previous data [14] and confirmed the interference of MDNAs with vaccine viremia. This experiment also indi-cated that in piglets with low levels of MDNAs, vaccination induced significant humoral and cellular post-vaccine immune response, which also corroborates our previous results [14] .

In the present study, we observed a lower interference of MDNAs on post-vaccine immune responses compared to the previous one reported by Fablet [14] where a complete impairment was observed during 4 weeks pv. This reduced interference could be ascribed to the need to vaccinate the piglets twice and the ensuing decrease of MDNAs levels at the time of the second vaccination. At the time of first vaccination (3 woa), the decrease of MDNA level was already high but the mean NA titre in the present study (10 ± 5) was comparable to the one in Fablet's study (20 ± 15) . Despite the slightly reduced post-vaccine differences between A +V+ and AÀV+ we observed in the present study, the postchallenge results demonstrated for the first time that the PRRSV vaccination was effective only in piglets with low levels of MDNAs. The low virulence of the PRRSV-1 strain used to challenge the animals limited the evaluation of the vaccine efficacy to virological parameters only. We previously demonstrated that the Porcilis PRRS vaccine can protect SPF piglets (no MDAs) from a challenge with the same low virulent strain, decreasing the viremia in inoculated piglets and considerably reducing the transmission of the Finistere strain to contact piglets [8] . In the present study, the challenge strain viral load was significantly reduced only in AÀV+ inoculated and contact piglets compared to unvaccinated piglets. In a similar unpublished study, we also showed that PRRSV challenge strain viremia was significantly reduced for AÀV+ inoculated piglets compared to A+V+ animals during the first 3 weeks pi ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . In this study, vaccine viremia was also only detected in 1 out of 12 AÀV+ piglet at W2 post-vaccination but a second vaccination was not performed before challenge, indicating that the negative impact of MDNAs on PRRS vaccine efficacy also occurred in the absence of vaccine viremia and with usual single vaccination protocols implemented in the field.

Using a closely-related approach, Jeong et al. evaluated the efficacy of a PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine in 1-day-old piglets with maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) but no impact of MDAs was observed [17] . In Jeong's study, all the piglets were MDA+ at vaccination (no MDA-group included) and thus this precluded to clearly evaluating the impact of MDAs on the vaccine efficacy. As the same, Balasch et al. recently showed that vaccination of 1-day-old piglets using a new PRRSV-1 MLV in presence of MDAs induced a partial protection against a challenge at 67 days pv [18] . In Balasch's study, NAs were quantified in piglets at the vaccination time but here also the absence of comparison with vaccinated piglets without MDNAs limits the conclusions of the study.

The interference of MDAs on vaccine efficacy was previously demonstrated for many other swine diseases. Using a killed vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2, a similar study comparing vaccine efficacy in piglets with low or high MDA levels showed a significant reduction of percentage of PCR positive animals in AÀV+ group compared to A+V+ group at 22 days post-challenge [19] . Using a MLV against classical swine fever, 83% of piglets with high MDNA levels at vaccination died from a challenge at 10 weeks of age, whereas all piglets with low MDNA levels, survived from the challenge [20] .

In addition, considering the contact animals, our results also demonstrated that MDNAs decreased the PRRS vaccine efficacy on virus transmission. In the present study, PRRS vaccination in AÀV+ piglets reduced the transmission rate of the Finistere strain two-fold compared to the rate estimated for the V-group. The magnitude of the effect is substantially lower than what was found in our previous study with a ten-fold reduced transmission rate in vaccinated SPF pigs, with non MDA [8] . One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be the intradermal route (ID) used for vaccination in our previous work. This immunization route was previously shown to induce an enhanced cell-mediated immune response after PRRSV exposure and a lower respiratory clinical score compared to IM vaccination [5] . The better immune response, especially at the mucosal sites, elicited after ID immunization, may have limited viral replication in the respiratory tract, thus reducing virus excretion and transmission. In Fablet et al. study [14] , vaccine viremia was detected in 60% of AÀV+ piglets at W2 pv whereas only in 12.5% of AÀV+ piglets of the present study after the first vaccination. To explore these unexpected results, we attempted to investigate the origin of this low vaccine replication displayed in AÀV+ piglets after vaccination at 3 woa. The vaccine strain was titrated, but no problem was detected. As IFNa was recently shown to strongly inhibit the replication of a genotype 2 PRRS MLV [21] , we hypothesized this cytokine could be responsible for the inhibition of vaccine replication in our AÀV+ piglets. Indeed, the levels of IFNa detected in piglets from the present study at 3 woa were much higher than those from our previous study [14] and in the same range as the concentration shown to be able to completely inhibit PRRS MLV replication [22] .

To bring some preliminary conclusions, it seems that IFNa concentrations likely to interfere with PRRS MLV replication could be achieved in piglets under field conditions. In the absence of suitable samples (not of the right type or not collected at the right time) for further exploration, we were not able to identify the cause of these increased IFNa levels. However, this cytokine is known to be produced in response to many viral infections such as swine influenza [23] or porcine respiratory coronavirus [24, 25] that could infect piglets at weaning when they are frequently vaccinated against PRRSV. As a result, this potential viral interference with the PRRS MLV vaccine may be another possible explanation for the limited PRRS MLV vaccine efficacy observed in the field.

Our results confirm that MDNAs impair PRRS vaccine strain replication and post-vaccination immune response. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that this impaired immune response results in decreased vaccine efficacy based on virological parameters evaluation after a low virulent PRRSV challenge. The use of a more virulent strain for the challenge of the animals may bring further clinical arguments regarding the reduced vaccine efficacy in presence of high levels of MDNAs. Unexpectedly, we also showed that other factors such as IFNa may interfere with PRRS MLV vaccination. Further research is needed to explore a possible viral interference phenomenon toward PRRS MLV vaccines. At the end, the low efficacy of PRRS vaccination observed in the field could thus result from endogenous (MDAs) as well as exogenous (viral infection) factors. RT-PCR at one week post-vaccination (W1 pv) in Experiment B or at W2 pv in Experiment A. All data are reported as the mean (±SEM) of results obtained from piglets in each group. Different letters (a, b) indicate that the groups are significantly different from each other with p < 0.05. Post-vaccination times were related to the first vaccination week as W0 pv.

viruses Human Antimicrobial Peptides as Therapeutics for Viral Infections,"Successful in vivo infection following pathogen entry requires the evasion and subversion of multiple immunological barriers. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the first immune pathways upregulated during infection by multiple pathogens, in multiple organs in vivo. In humans, there are many classes of AMPs exhibiting broad antimicrobial activities, with defensins and the human cathelicidin LL-37 being the best studied examples. Whereas historically the efficacy and therapeutic potential of AMPs against bacterial infection has been the primary focus of research, recent studies have begun to elucidate the antiviral properties of AMPs as well as their role in regulation of inflammation and chemoattraction. AMPs as therapeutic tools seem especially promising against emerging infectious viral pathogens for which no approved vaccines or treatments are currently available, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). In this review, we summarize recent studies elucidating the efficacy and diverse mechanisms of action of various classes of AMPs against multiple viral pathogens, as well as the potential use of human AMPs in novel antiviral therapeutic strategies.","Found in virtually all organisms, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, positively-charged oligopeptides that exhibit a diversity of structures and functions. AMPs are a fundamental component of the innate immune system and play a vital role in the initial immune response generated against both injury and infections. AMP-mediated immune responses are rapidly activated following infections as AMPs are primarily synthesized and stored in cells of myeloid origin and epithelial cells, among the first responders to infections. AMPs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues including skin, eyes, oral cavity, ears, airway, lung, female reproductive tract, cervical-vaginal fluid, intestines, and urinary tract [1, 2] . The majority of AMPs are synthesized as large polyprotein precursors, the proteolytic processing of which releases active peptide segments which can be present alone or in multiple copies. Removal of signal peptide may be a post-translation or a co-translational process. Processed functional peptides have been characterized into many classes in mammals; in humans, they include defensins, cathelicidins, transferrins, hepcidin, human antimicrobial proteins, dermcidin, histones, AMPs derived from known proteins, chemokines, and AMPs from immune cells, antimicrobial neuropeptides, and Beta-amyloid peptides [3] . While all of the AMPs classes have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity, only a few classes have demonstrated antiviral properties.

A defining feature of AMPs is their rapid response to infections of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa [1, 4] . Exhibiting inhibitory and immunomodulatory properties, AMPs have been intensively studied as alternatives to antibiotics in bacterial infections and in recent years have gained substantial attention as viral therapeutics [5] . Here we report on the application of human AMPs in the treatment of viral infections.

Highly abundant and widely distributed, defensins modulate immune responses thereby playing a central role in innate immunity [6] [7] [8] . Defensins are classified into three subgroups: α, β and θ. Although humans do not produce functional members of the θ-defensin family of AMPs, expression of θ-defensin mRNA has been observed in humans. The θ-defensin mRNA contains a pre-mature stop codon which prevents translation; however, functional θ-defensins are present in non-human primates [9] . To date, six α-defensin and 31 β-defensin peptides have been identified in various species [9] . Originally isolated from neutrophils, four of the six distinct α-defensins are termed human neutrophil peptides (HNP-1 through 4). They are also produced by myeloid-lineage cells such as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and some classes of T and B-cells. α-defensins 5 (HD5) and 6 (HD6) are expressed in epithelial cells in the small intestine [6, [8] [9] [10] . The β-defensin family of AMPs is commonly expressed in birds and mammals. In humans, three β-defensins (HBD-1 through 3) have been fully characterized and a fourth, HBD-4, was recently identified. β-defensins are primarily expressed by epithelial cells and keratinocytes, but can also be produced by neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes [6] [7] [8] 10] . Current data suggest a functional redundancy when comparing the efficacy of α and β defensins against various pathogens [11] .

Defensins are defined by the presence of a conserved spacing pattern comprised of cysteine residues, which is critical for the efficacy of their cationic antimicrobial properties [9, 12] . Human α-defensins are composed of 29 to 34 amino acids with an overall positive charge [9, 12, 13] . Defensins exhibit a characteristic β-sheet structure with a distinctive six-cysteine motif for which stabilization is a consequence of the presence of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The α-defensins are synthesized as pre-propeptides consisting of a N-terminal signal sequence, an anionic pro-peptide, and a C-terminal mature peptide comprised of approximately 30 amino acids. HNP1, HNP2, and HNP3 are synthesized by promyelocytes and stored in primary neutrophil granules as mature peptides [10] . In contrast, β-defensins have a short N-terminal pro-region and can retain antimicrobial activity in full-length form, and; therefore, do not require N-terminal processing to be fully active [14] . They are synthesized in epithelial compartments and can range from 38 to 42 amino acids in length.

The antiviral activity of defensins was first reported in 1986 [10] . Since then, defensins have demonstrated protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), human adenovirus (HAdV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSC), papillomavirus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [5, 10, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Recent studies have focused on elucidating the multiple mechanisms associated with defensins' antiviral activity (Table 1) . Defensins can block viral infection through direct action on virus particles or interfere indirectly at various stages of the viral life cycle [10, 18] . Available data suggest antiviral activity occurs predominantly at viral entry steps; however, antiviral effects at other stages of infection have also been reported, particularly affecting viral trafficking within infected cells [19] . Defensins can also modify the innate immune response to viral infections, including: modulation of T-cells, macrophage and dendritic cells recruitment to sites of infection, wound healing and angiogenesis, differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells, induction of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, mast cells, and keratinocytes, and regulation of cell death pathways [9] . For example, HBD-3 can suppress activation of the caspase cascade to prevent apoptosis in infected cells [20] . Similarly, the concentration of HNPs released into the microenvironment upon activation of neutrophils during inflammation exerts a differential effect on cytokine production in activated monocytes [19] . HNP concentrations of 1 to 10 nM can upregulate the expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), whereas concentrations of 10 to 100 µM are cytotoxic to monocytes.

Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is capable of infecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, ocular, and excretory systems in humans. There are approximately 80 recognized HAdV serotypes, subdivided into species A-G [21, 22] . Currently there are only a limited number of HAdV therapeutic strategies and vaccines available to treat HAdV infections. Alpha defensins have demonstrated an ability to hinder HAdV infections in vitro [21, 23] . HD5 reduces HAdV replication by 95% when cells are exposed to the peptide (IC 50 = 3-4 µM) prior to infection, and by 50% when peptide is added 30-60 min post inoculation, suggesting that inhibition occurs at an early stage during viral infection [21] . Additional studies have shown that direct binding of HD5 (10 µM) to HAdV particles prior to infection prevents the release of internalized viral particles from endosomes [24] . Subsequently, viral particles appear to colocalize with lysosomes indicating altered viral trafficking following infection as a consequence of HD5 binding [24] . These findings suggest defensins' antiviral activity against HAdV results in blockage of HAdV uncoating and genome exposure [24] . In addition, HD5 antiviral activity is species specific; pre-treatment with 15µM HD5 decreased HAdV infectivity of subspecies A-C and E, while infectivity of HAdV subspecies D and F demonstrated no change [23] . The cause of species specificity of HD5 activity is yet to be determined.

During the early infiltrate in influenza A virus (IAV), neutrophils predominate in infected airways, highlighting their importance in initiating immune responses against IAV [13] . Defensins are; thus, likely to interact with IAV. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) displaying HNPs are formed in vivo and in vitro in response to IAV infection [13] . Cells incubated with defensins pre-or post-infection demonstrated minimal inhibitory activity against IAV, whereas incubation of HNPs with virions prior to infection is necessary for the antiviral activity of these AMPs against IAV (e.g., HNP1 IC 50 < 2 µg/mL [25] ) [13, 26] . In addition, the binding activity of defensins against IAV is increased by formation of multi-molecular assemblies of defensins, which may be responsible for pore formation in the IAV envelope, thereby destabilizing virions prior to receptor binding and cellular entry [13] .

Expression of β-defensins HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3 has been reported in various epithelial cell tissues, with each β-defensin demonstrating a unique expression induction profile in response to IAV infection [13] . However, HBD1 and HBD2 have also been detected in monocytes, macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and possess strong neutralizing activity against multiple IAV strains [10, 13] . HBDs exhibit low potency as direct inhibitors of IAV virions, but are speculated to play important immunomodulatory roles by limiting inflammation during IAV infection [13] . While the exact sequence of immunomodulatory events is yet to be determined, it has been reported that deletion of the HBD1 analog in mice resulted in a more serious inflammatory reaction to IAV [13, 27] . In addition, HBD3 has demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects in cells stimulated with 50 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), confirmed by the inhibition of expression of inflammatory mediators such as (TNF-α) [28] . Conversely, α-defensins inhibit IAV replication in infected cells. Pre-incubation of virions with HNP-1 (25 µg/mL) is capable of reducing the replication of IAV strain H1N1 by 10-to 1000-fold in multiple cell lines when compared to replication in untreated cells [29] . Similarly, HNP-1 and 2 can reduce infectious virus of the Phil82 strain of IAV by 85% to 90% in various cell lines [26] .

Defensins demonstrate antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), mediated by direct virus-peptide interaction and/or inhibition of viral genome replication. Inhibition mediated by the direct binding of defensins with HIV virions is attributed to interactions between positively-charged HNPs and negatively-charged moieties of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120. HNP1, HNP2, and HNP3 function as lectins by directly blocking the interaction of gp120 and the HIV receptor CD4. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is not well characterized [10, 13] . HNP-1 can also interfere with critical steps in the HIV replication cycle [30] . HNP-1 inhibits protein kinase C signaling, which is important for the transcription and nuclear import of the HIV genome [31] . HD5 exhibits a robust dose-dependent (IC 50 = 400 nM) suppression of HIV-1 replication in absence of serum when pre-incubated with virions [32] . HD5 also blocks HIV-1 infection at a step prior to viral entry [32] . HD5 competitively binds to the CD4 receptor in a dose-dependent manner against HIV, thereby blocking HIV entry into target cells [32] . Interestingly, in contrast to HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and HD5, HNP4 does not interact with CD4 or HIV gp120 [13] . HNP4 inhibits HIV replication with greater effectiveness than HNP1, HNP2, and HNP3, but it is unclear whether efficacy of HNP4 is mediated only through a direct effect on virions or also on host processes that ultimately affect viral replication.

β-defensins can also exert antiviral activities against HIV. Expression of HBD2 and HBD3 can be induced by microbial products such as endotoxins, viruses, bacteria, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1β [13] . Expression of HBD2 and HBD3, but not HBD1, mRNA can be induced by HIV in human oral epithelial cells. HBD2 inhibits the formation of early HIV transcript products but does not affect cell-cell fusion [10] .

Alpha and β-defensins can exhibit anti-HSV properties [33] . HNP-1-4 and HD6 inhibit HSV binding to its target receptor by directly interacting with either the HSV glycoprotein or by binding to heparan sulfate (HS), thereby preventing viral entry [8, 33] . HBD3 binds either the HSV receptor or the HSV glycoprotein, thereby eliciting a stronger inhibition of viral entry. Furthermore, treatment of infected cells with defensins post-infection results in substantial reduction in viral replication, indicating that these peptides can exhibit post entry antiviral effects [33] . In addition, studies exploring HNP-1-3 have demonstrated their ability to reduce intracellular HSV protein transport and expression during infection [34] . HNP-1 (100 µg/mL) exhibits the greatest antiviral potential against HSV, reducing HSV titers up to 100,000-fold upon a combination of pre-and post-treatment of infected cells as compared to HNP-2 and HNP-3 (100 µg/mL), which can reduce titers by up to 100-fold following treatment [33] .

The antiviral effects of human defensins against RSV are relatively unexplored. A study assessing leukotriene B4 (LTB4) stimulation of nasal neutrophil activity highlighted α-defensins as a possible source of antiviral activity against RSV [35] . Cells pre-treated with HBD-2 (4 µg/mL), can reduce RSV viral titers 100-fold following infection [36] . Electron microscopy images revealed damage to the lipid envelope of RSV following HBD-2 treatment, suggesting that defensins destabilize RSV virion envelopes, thereby inhibiting viral cellular entry [36] . The use of defensins in anti-RSV therapies may also limit viral evolutionary strategies that counters antiviral activities, due to the difficulty of changing the viral envelope lipid composition [37] . The evolutionary longevity of defensins suggests this to be a favorable strategy, making defensins an attractive therapeutic candidate for the treatment of RSV infections [16] .

Most α-defensins possess some level of anti-human papilloma virus (HPV) activity, with HD-6 being a notable exception [38] . Due to their low toxicity and high efficacy, HNP-1 and HD-5 have been most frequently tested as anti-HPV candidates. Recent studies have focused solely on HD5 as it is secreted by epithelial cells in the genitourinary tract. The antiviral activity of HNP-1 and HD5 (5 µg/mL) against HPV is time-independent, with robust inhibition even when peptides are introduced to cells six hours post infection in vitro [38] . Employing immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, the authors demonstrated that the peptides do not inhibit viral entry but rather prevent virion escape from cytoplasmic vesicles [38] . During the course of HPV entry, cleavage of HPV L2 capsid protein by furin, a cellular protease, is required for successful infection [39] . HD5 directly disrupts this proteolytic processing step, thereby preventing HPV genome escape from endosomes [39] . Interestingly, the use of a furin-cleaved HPV does not result in abrogation of HD5 activity. HD5 can still block HPV infection by preventing viral capsid dissociation from the genome, and by reducing viral trafficking within the host cells [40] . These results indicate that α-defensins, particularly HD5, demonstrate robust anti-HPV activity by targeting multiple steps during viral life cycle.

Cathelicidins are peptides with a conserved 100-amino-acid cathelin domain, a protein sequence first identified in porcine leukocytes that is capable of inhibiting the protease cathepsin-L [9] . Cathelicidins are typically linear peptides that fold into amphipathic α-helical structures which are frequently cleaved from the highly variable C-terminal antimicrobial domain [12] . In humans, cathelicidin is produced by a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway [41] . Although there are multiple cathelicidins found in nature, humans only express a single cathelicidin, known as human cationic antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAMP-18), hCAP18, or LL-37. LL-37 was identified and isolated in 1995 from neutrophils [1, 42] . Like α-defensins, cathelicidins are synthesized as pre-propeptides; following proteolytic removal of the signal peptide, the inactive propeptide is tagged for storage in neutrophil granules. The active cationic molecule is generated by cleavage of the C-terminus end of the hCAP18 precursor protein yielding a linear 37-amino-acid-long peptide [1] . The name hCAP18 alludes to the molecular weight of the polypeptide (18 kDa) and the cationic character of the structure, whereas LL-37 refers to the 37 amino acid length of the peptide along with a Leu-Leu motif located at the N-terminus [1] . The peptide can also be produced in epithelial cells and may play an important role in the initial immune response to various pathogens [10, 11] . In epithelial skin cells, LL-37 is further cleaved into shorter segments exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity [43] . LL-37 is also produced by monocytes, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, colon enterocytes, and keratinocytes [1] , and has been detected in numerous tissues and biological fluids such as sweat, breast milk, wound fluid, vernix, tracheal aspirates of newborns, and seminal plasma [9] . The concentration of LL-37 and its precursor in tissues and body fluids can range between 2 and 5 µg/mL (0.4-1 µM); however, concentrations can increase up to 20 µg/mL (2.2 µM) during infections in bronchoalveolar fluid [44] . In nasal secretions LL-37 concentrations can vary from 1.2-80 µg/mL [44] . The expression of LL-37 is regulated by a number of endogenous factors including pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as the active form of vitamin D [1] . LL-37 functions as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic and T-cells and is rapidly released by epithelial cells and leukocytes following infection [11, 45] . LL-37 can stimulate IL-6 production in human dendritic cells and may act as both an anti and pro-inflammatory factor during the immune response to various infections [45] . Individuals with cathelicidin deficient neutrophils display an increased susceptibility to infection [11] .

The antiviral activity of LL-37 has been reported against a number of viruses including HIV-1, IAV, RSV, rhinovirus (HRV), vaccinia virus (VACV), HSV, ZIKV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV), mediated primarily by its interaction with the virus outer envelope (Table 1) [18, 41, 43, 46] . LL-37 is proposed to remove the outer membrane of viruses in a single event during an antimicrobial attack rather than a gradual piece-by-piece removal [37] . This suggests a carpet model of antimicrobial peptide action, wherein a susceptible membrane remains intact until a threshold concentration of peptide is reached, following which a rapid disintegration of the targeted membrane occurs [47, 48] .

LL-37 therapeutic activity against influenza type A virus has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. It is likely that in vivo, IAV encounters LL-37 in the respiratory tract following innate immune responses against the virus and is secreted from neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells [44, 49] . Early studies assessed the antiviral activity of LL-37 in vivo using a mouse IAV strain [50] . Mice were nebulized with LL-37 (500 µg/mL) a day prior to infection with a lethal dose of IVA PR/8 mouse strain and survival and weight loss were monitored for 14 days following infection [50] . Initially, all mice exhibited weight loss, but weight loss ceased at day seven in mice treated with LL-37 or the IAV antiviral zanamivir. Mice treated with LL-37 and zanamivir exhibited 60% survival compared to the untreated group which succumbed to infection by day nine suggesting that therapeutic use of LL-37 reduces IAV infection severity in a manner comparable to zanamivir [50] . LL-37 also decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines particularly IL-1β, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), keratinocytes chemoattractant (KC), and the chemotactic cytokine known as regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in mice infected with PR/8 at two days following LL-37 treatment as determined by immunoassay demonstrating the immunomodulatory properties of LL-37 [50] . In vitro plaque assays demonstrated one log inhibition of PR/8 when virus was pre-incubated with LL-37 (50 µg/mL) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [50] .

During IAV infection, in vitro LL-37 treatment did not prevent viral uptake, cause viral aggregation, and was not associated with blocking of hemagglutinin (HA). Interestingly LL-37 inhibits IAV replication at post-entry steps prior to viral RNA or protein synthesis [44] . A reduction in viral load, direct antiviral effects in epithelial cells, and inflammatory cytokine production have all been linked to LL-37 activity [49] . LL-37 inhibits the NY01 strain of IAV with a significant reduction in uptake of virus into cells, and in a manner dependent on dosage [44, 49] . For optimal anti-IAV activity the central helix of LL-37 is required, as evident by fragments of LL-37 containing the complete central sequence of the peptide demonstrating more robust antiviral responses as compared to fragments with shorter central fragments. At a concentration of <2 µM, NY01 was only partially inhibited; however, this inhibition was surprisingly lost at higher concentrations of LL-37 [44] . A strain containing only the pandemic HA (Mex 1:7); however, was inhibited by LL-37 at all concentrations tested (up to 10 µM). Consistent with previous studies, these results suggest the antiviral effects of LL-37 are not determined by direct interaction of LL-37 with the viral HA [44] .

Experimental data also demonstrates the participation of LL-37 in host defenses against IAV through modulation of innate immune cells, particularly neutrophils. IAV infection induces a respiratory burst response in neutrophils, and this response is noticeably up-regulated by pre-incubation of LL-37 with IAV [49] . LL-37 alone does not stimulate this respiratory burst response; however, optimal enhancement of this antiviral response is achieved only when the virus is pre-incubated with LL-37 [49] . Furthermore, there is growing evidence that NET formations play an important role during IAV infections [49] . Recently, in vivo studies have provided evidence of NET formation in the lungs of IAV-infected mice [51] . On the other hand, in vitro evidence of binding of IVA to NETs suggests LL-37 induces an increase in NET formation in response to IAV, which may promote viral clearance in vivo [49, 51] . Data also suggest that significant protection against IAV may be provided by therapeutic treatment of influenza infected individuals with LL-37 or by increasing natural cathelicidin expression in the IAV-infected lung [11] . Hence, to maximize anti-IAV functions, approaches, such as therapeutic administration of naturally-occurring cathelicidins, as well as increasing vitamin D levels to boost endogenous cathelicidin have been proposed [11] .

Earlier studies provided evidence of LL-37 ability to protect against HIV-1 infection given epithelial expression of LL-37, including in peripheral blood mononuclear cells such as CD4+ T-cells in vitro [52] . LL-37 directly inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase via a protein-protein interaction in a dose-dependent manner (IC 50 = 15 µM) [9, 53] . Inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity with LL-37 has also been reported; however, this activity is less potent when compared to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (20%-30% inhibition at 100 µM). In addition, the plasma levels of LL-37 in HIV positive individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) are much higher than in patients who are not, corresponding with an increased susceptibility to secondary infections in patients not undergoing ART [54] .

To date, little research has been performed to characterize the antiviral activity of LL-37 against DENV. However, a recent study demonstrated that treatment of dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) with LL-37 inhibits viral infection in green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Incubation of virus with LL-37 (10-15 µM) prior to infection inhibits production of viral particles, whereas pre-treatment of cells with LL-37 demonstrates no effect on viral replication [43] . Molecular docking studies of DENV-2 E protein have revealed the direct binding of LL-37 with E2 protein moieties, further demonstrating the peptide's ability to act as an entry inhibitor [43] . A more recent study assessed truncated and full length variants of LL-37 against other serotypes of DENV which revealed the inhibitory properties of LL-37 required the full length peptide [55] . In comparison to DENV-2, DENV-4 required higher concentrations of LL-37 for inhibition with effect being not as potent as with the former. DENV-1 and DENV-3 inhibition however, was prominent at lower concentrations of LL-37 [55] . A recent study using DENV-2 infected keratinocytes has demonstrated the production of AMPs by infected cells as well as bystander cells [56] . Pre-incubation of cells with LL-37 prior to DENV-2 infection results in a significant decrease in viral titers and replication in infected keratinocytes, whereas HBD2 and HBD3 demonstrate minimal inhibition [56] . Additionally, as vitamin D is an inducer of LL-37 expression, supplementation of populations with vitamin D prior to DENV outbreak seasons has been suggested as a possible preventative strategy to control the virus at initial stages of infection [43] .

A few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of LL-37 against RSV [11, 57] . Cells pre-incubated with LL-37 (>10 µg/mL) are protected against RSV infection whereas addition of LL-37 two hours post-infection results in decreased antiviral activity [57] . Additionally, LL-37 can limit viral-induced cell death in infected cell cultures indicating that the peptide's activity is not limited to prophylactic treatment. Treatment of epithelial cells with LL-37 prior to infection results in peptide internalization and retention, which provides antiviral protection for several hours post-treatment [57] . Furthermore, RSV infection induces the production of cytokines and chemokines in lungs. LL-37 (50 µg/mL) can impact the expression of chemokines as well as viral load when pre-incubated with RSV [11] . While the exact mechanism of the antiviral activity of LL-37 against RSV is not well established, it is speculated that the peptide directly interacts with the virus prior to infection due to its dose-dependent early effects on RSV infection. Interestingly, children with lower cathelicidin levels are more susceptible to RSV infection and display an increase in the severity of RSV-associated bronchitis [58] .

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are causative agents of the common cold and most viral respiratory tract infections. As respiratory epithelial cells are the primary targets of HRV infection, studies evaluating the efficacy of LL-37 on HRV have utilized airway epithelial cells. LL-37 (50 µg/mL) demonstrates direct antiviral activity against HRV when added as a pre-treatment by acting on viral particles, and when added post infection by acting on the host cell [59] . LL-37 can induce a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of infected cells, as measured by mitochondrial metabolic potential [59] . Studies evaluating HRV in cystic fibrosis cells have revealed that expression of LL-37 decreases HRV viral load in vivo [60] . Thus, LL-37 reduces HRV infections in respiratory cells as well as in cystic fibrosis cells.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a DNA virus that can infect many types of mammalian cells. LL-37 limits VACV replication and can alter viral membranes [61] . VACV gene expression and viral titers are reduced in a dose-dependent manner in cells pre-incubated with LL-37(25-50 µM) [61] . Transmission electron microscopy images have shown a disruption in the integrity of VACV viral membrane after 24 h incubation with LL-37. Whereas murine LL-37 has demonstrated great efficacy and protection against VACV during infection, the efficacy of human LL-37 against VACV is unknown [61] .

Few studies evaluating the efficacy of LL-37 against HSV-1 have been performed, all of which assessed LL-37 inhibition of HSV-1 in the context of a corneal infection [62] . LL-37 (500 µg/mL) can inhibit HSV-1 infection when pre-incubated with virions in vitro [62] . LL-37 reduces viral titers in corneal epithelial cells by more than 100-fold when compared to a scrambled LL-37 control [62] . Another study evaluating the anti-HSV-1 activity on corneal implants assessed the release of LL-37 delivered through corneal implant-incorporated nanoparticles [63] . Whereas LL-37 did not clear viruses from infected cells, it blocked HSV-1 infection in corneal epithelial cells by preventing viral-cell attachment [63] . These studies reinforce the mechanism of LL-37 antiviral activity as entry inhibition. Interestingly, LL-37 released from HSV-1 infected keratinocytes can also enhance HIV-1 infection [64] . This study measured the susceptibility of Langerhans cells (LC) to HIV-1 and implicates LL-37 in increasing HIV-1 cell receptor counts, resulting in increased HIV-1 infection [64] . While there are numerous studies linking a decrease in HIV-1 infection as a consequence of LL-37 or defensin treatment, the difference in this activity of the AMPs is possibly attributed to different cell targets.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that can cause fever, headaches, rashes, joint pain, and myalgia in children and adults, and ""microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, intracranial calcifications, abnormalities of the corpus callosum, retinal lesions, craniofacial disorder, hearing loss, and dysphagia"" in neonates [65] . The emergence of ZIKV is a global concern since it is the first major infectious disease that has been associated with birth defects in over five decades [66] . Currently, no vaccines or treatments are available to prevent ZIKV infection [66] . He et al. [46] conducted a study to determine whether LL-37 and synthetic derivatives can be used to treat ZIKV infection in primary human fetal astrocytes [46] . Whereas LL-37 is toxic to these cells (EC 50 = 20 M), an LL-37 derivative, GF-17, can be safely used due to its lower toxicity (EC 50 > 50 µM) [46] . Treatment of primary human fetal astrocytes with 10 µM of GF-17 24 h after ZIKV infection results in a seven-fold decrease in the number of ZIKV plaque forming units [46] . Pre-incubation of ZIKV between 1 and 4 h with GF-17 (10 µM), results in at least a 95% decrease in the number of active zika virions [46] . In addition to the possibility of GF-17 directly interacting with ZIKV virions as a mechanism of antiviral activity, GF-17 increases interferon-α2 (IFN-α2) expression in a dose-dependent manner, which further impacts the ability of ZIKV to infect primary human fetal astrocytes [46] . The study suggests that GF-17 may be a possible option for the prevention and treatment of ZIKV infections [46] .

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major worldwide health concern with possible severe outcomes including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death if an infection is left untreated [67] . Whereas effective antivirals against HCV infections exist, there is an unmet need for novel anti-HCV treatments that can overcome current treatment barriers such as cost and access to healthcare [41, 67] . LL-37 has demonstrated anti-HCV properties in cell culture. HCV titers are significantly reduced when HCV is pre-incubated with LL-37 and subsequently used to infect Huh-7 cells [41] . Although different strains of HCV were utilized in this study, the antiviral effects of LL-37 are not associated or dependent on a specific HCV strain. Decrease in viral replication occurs in a dose-dependent manner [41] . Furthermore, of LL-37 primarily acts against HCV extracellularly, consistent with the activity of LL-37 against other enveloped viruses.

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an alphavirus that has been categorized as biothreat agent due to ease of aerosolization and high retention of infectivity in the aerosol form [68, 69] . Currently there are no FDA approved therapeutics to combat VEEV infections. LL-37 has recently demonstrated anti-VEEV activity in vitro [70] . A significant decrease in intracellular VEEV genomic RNA copies was observed upon pre-incubation of LL-37 (10 µg/mL) and VEEV. Microscopy data revealed the extracellular aggregation of VEEV virions, suggesting the mechanism of action of LL-37 against VEEV is through direct interaction with viral particles, thereby inhibiting entry [70] . Pre-treatment of human microglial cells with LL-37 prior to infection also resulted in a significant reduction in VEEV titers, suggesting entry prevention is not the only mechanism of LL-37-mediated inhibition. Indeed, LL-37 increased the expression of type I interferon (IFNβ), possibly inducing an antiviral state [70] . LL-37 could prove as a potent therapeutic candidate against VEEV and possibly other alphaviruses.

The most notable AMP exhibiting antiviral activity of the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins is lactoferrin (LF), a multifunctional 80 KDa glycoprotein [71, 72] . Originally discovered in bovine milk, LF is highly conserved and can be found in humans, mice, and porcine species. It is expressed in most biological fluids such as exocrine secretions (milk, saliva, fluids of digestive tract, and tears) and in neutrophil granules [72, 73] . LF serves as a key component of innate immune defenses and demonstrates antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and viruses through direct action on pathogen membrane and target host cell moieties as well as through modulation of inflammation (Table 1) [72, 74] .

LF expression may be induced under hormonal control by epithelial cells in mammary glands or at well-defined stages of cell cycle such as neutrophil differentiation [74, 75] . LF structure consists of a polypeptide chain that is characterized by a highly basic and positively-charged N-terminal region [74, 76] . The LF chain folds into two globular lobes linked by a three-turn alpha helix, with each lobe containing an iron-binding site [77] . There is a strong interaction between the two lobes when iron is bound, which renders LF resistant to proteolysis in this holo form as compared to an open apo form [77] . In the stomach, acidic pepsin hydrolysis of the N-terminal of LF yields lactoferricin (Lfcin), a 25-amino-acid peptide with multiple hydrophobic, positively-charged residues [74, 76] . Lfcin retains the properties of LF and demonstrates potent antiviral activity.

Early studies have demonstrated the direct anti-RSV activity of LF in vitro [78] [79] [80] . In HEp-2 cells, LF (100 µg/mL) decreased the production of IL-8 induced by RSV infection when pre-incubated with virions. This LF-mediated inhibition was dependent on LF-RSV interactions as LF inhibited RSV entry into HEp-2 cells [79] . Pre-incubation of LF (100 µg/mL) with RSV resulted in decreased viral entry. LF was found to inhibit RSV entry by directly binding to the F 1 subunit of the RSV F protein, which mediates fusion of the virion with the cell membrane [79] .

Human and bovine LF have demonstrated anti-IAV activity. Bovine LF inhibits IAV-mediated programmed cell death and directly binds viral hemagglutinin leading to inhibition of viral hemagglutination [81] [82] [83] [84] . Only a few studies; however, have evaluated the activity of human LF in the context of IAV infection. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, human LF (20-80 µg/mL) demonstrated enhanced antiviral activity against avian IAV in a dose-dependent manner [85] . In addition, bovine LF inhibited parainfluenza virus replication in vitro and decreased viral adsorption onto cells, thereby preventing viral entry [86] . Together these results highlight the possible role of LF in preventing influenza and parainfluenza virus infections.

Lactoferrin-mediated anti-HAdV activity occurs at multiple stages during infection. In one study LF inhibited HAdV replication during different phases of infection; when the peptide was introduced before infection, after viral adsorption, and when the peptide was present throughout the experiment, indicating more than one mechanism of action may be involved [87] . Bovine LF has also demonstrated anti-HAdV properties in a dose-dependent manner similar to human LF [87] [88] [89] . Bovine LF demonstrated the greatest inhibition when virus was pre-incubated with LF (1 mg/mL), which was validated by electron microscopy imaging the binding of LF to HAdV, thus suggesting direct LF inhibition as a mechanism of action [89] , In contrast, human LF in tear fluids was implicated in promoting HAdV binding to epithelial cells, whereby HAdV hijacks human LF and utilizes the protein in order to bind to host cells [90] .

Studies assessing inhibition of HSV-1 have revealed the potency of LF at inhibiting replication of the viruses. LF (0.5-1 mg/mL) inhibited HSV-1 replication in human embryo lung cells and prevented virus adsorption and entry [91] . Marchetti et al. also demonstrated the ability of bovine and human LF to inhibit HSV-1 replication and adsorption in Vero cells independent of iron-binding [92, 93] . Furthermore, intracellular trafficking of virions that gained entry was delayed [94] . Similar inhibitory properties were displayed by Lfcin when the peptide was tested against HSV-1 [94] . In addition, cell-to-cell viral spread was inhibited by LF as well as Lfcin [95] . The data presented by these studies demonstrate LF's antiviral properties against HSV.

Lactoferrin has demonstrated efficacy against HCV and HBV. Bovine LF can prevent HCV infection in human hepatocytes and in turn was tested as a measure to control HCV viremia in chronic hepatitis C patients [96] . However, LF only reduced HCV RNA in patients with previously low HCV RNA serum concentration. Conversely, a randomized trial of bovine LF in patients with chronic hepatitis C reported that orally-administered LF did not demonstrate significant efficacy against HCV when compared to a placebo control [97] . Combination therapy using the antiviral molecule ribavirin, LF, and interferon therapy, on the other hand, suggested that LF contributed to decreased HCV RNA titers [98] . These contradictory results suggest that while orally-administered LF may not be a promising stand-alone therapeutic, it can enhance the effectiveness of currently used therapeutics. Studies on the interaction of HCV and LF reported the direct interaction and binding of human and bovine LF with the HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 [99] . A more recent study concluded that LFs of various species directly prevented HCV cell entry by binding to virions. Furthermore, pre-incubation of virions or post-treatment of infected cells with human, bovine, sheep, or camel LF inhibited HCV replication in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, suggesting that LF may be used prophylactically as well as therapeutically, particularly in combined therapies [100] .

Pre-incubation of HBV with LF had no effect on viral replication; however, pre-treatment of cells with human or bovine LF prevented infection [101] . Bovine LF did not interact with HBV but indirectly protected cells from HBV infection [102] . In addition, iron or zin-saturated LF on HBV-infected HepG2 cells inhibited HBV-DNA amplification suggesting its use as a possible candidate for the treatment of HBV infections [103] .

Circulating LF plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients was significantly decreased compared to non-infected patients [104] , suggesting an important role for LF during HIV-1 infection and disease progression. Experiments assessing the role of LF in HIV-1 infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed LF (IC 50 = 9.6 µM) as a potent inhibitor of six clinical isolates of HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment of cells prior to infection [105] . Additionally, synergistic effects of human and bovine LF were assessed in combination with zidovudine, which also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition [105] . Bovine LF inhibited the HIV-1 entry process by binding to the viral envelope, and HIV-1 variants resistant to LF exhibit mutations in the viral envelope protein [106] . Bovine LF was found to be a more potent inhibitor than human LF in preventing dendritic cell-mediated HIV-1 transmission between cells by directly and strongly binding to DC-SIGN, a receptor molecule on dendritic cells that mediates HIV-1 internalization [106] .

In pediatric HIV-1 infections, LF enhanced responses to antiretroviral therapy by decreasing plasma viral load and modulating the immune system [107, 108] . LF treatment alone increased CD4+ cell counts, but a more significant increase was observed when LF was combined with antiretroviral therapy [107] . Result suggested that no HIV-1-related symptoms were evident for the duration of the experiments. However, large-scale studies are required in order to further assess LF's therapeutic potential against HIV.

Hantavirus is a zoonotic RNA virus that causes severe human disease characterized by widespread and extensive hemorrhaging [109] . In vitro studies have demonstrated that pre-treatment of Vero cells with LF (ED 50 = 39 µg/mL) significantly reduces Hantavirus foci number [110] . A combination of LF and ribavirin also significantly reduced the number of viral foci where pre-treatment of cells with LF (400 µg/mL), and treatment with ribavirin (100 µg/mL) post infection completely abolished viral foci [109] . In additional synthesis of viral glycoprotein, G2, and nucleocapsid protein (NP) was delayed in LF pretreated cells. In vivo testing revealed that prophylactic LF treatment (160 mg/kg) can significantly improve survival rates following hantavirus infection in suckling mice by up to 70% when compared with non-treated mice [109] .

Human and bovine LF and Lfcin have been demonstrated to inhibit the internalization of HPV-16 particles, as visualized using an HPV virus-like particle (VLP) that fluoresces after cellular internalization [111] . This inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner on HaCaT cells [111] . Bovine LF-mediated inhibition was more potent than human LF. However, both LFs inhibited HPV-5 and HPV-16 [112] . Different synthetic derivatives or variants of human and bovine Lfcin demonstrated selective inhibition of HPV, such that a human variant of Lfcin with amino acids 1 to 49 displayed antiviral activity as well as inhibition of attachment of both HPV strains while the bovine variant only inhibited HPV-5 infection [112] . These results suggest that different domains of Lfcin contain selective and specific antiviral properties which can be engineered to target specific infections and viral strains.

Rotavirus is one of the world's major causes of gastroenteritis in children. As an effort to develop anti-rotavirus strategies, milk proteins including apo-LF (25 µM) and Fe-LF were assessed for inhibitory properties against rotavirus [113] . Results demonstrated apo-LF to be the most potent inhibitor of rotavirus by binding to viral particles and hindering virus attachment as well as preventing rotavirus hemagglutination [113] . A randomized trial; however, concluded that orally-administered LF did not provide protection against rotavirus infection [114] . This serves as an example that the pronounced inhibition in vitro does not necessarily recapitulate the effects that occurs in vivo.

Lactoferrin antiviral activity against other viruses including poliovirus, alphaviruses, DENV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been studied. In Vero cells, iron-, manganese-, and zinc-saturated LFs have demonstrated anti-poliovirus properties in a dose-dependent manner when LFs were present either during the entire viral life cycle or during viral adsorption [115] . Against alphaviruses, human LF (200 µg/mL) inhibited infection of BHK-21 cells by Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) adapted to bind heparan sulfate (HS) upon pre-treatment of cells prior to infection [116] . The LF-mediated inhibition was thought to occur by binding of LF to heparan sulfate moieties, thereby preventing virus-receptor interactions [116] . Bovine LF was tested against JEV and DENV, and was capable of inhibiting replication of both viruses. In JEV, similar to alphaviruses, HS-adapted JEV strains were inhibited by bovine LF, while wild-type strains were not [117] . Bovine LF inhibited binding of DENV to HS by directly interacting with HS. Additionally, morbidity of DENV-infected suckling mice was reduced upon administration of a mixture of DENV and LF as compared to DENV-only-infected mice [118] .

Eosinophils contain large cytoplasmic granules that play a critical role in innate immune responses. These granules are storage hotspots for major cationic antimicrobial proteins including eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Both EDN and ECP are human antimicrobial proteins that are active ribonucleases and members of the human RNase A superfamily [119, 120] . The antimicrobial properties of RNases were mapped to the N-terminal domain that is conserved among ribonucleases [3] . While both proteins contain characteristic RNase A superfamily structures and catalytic residues, they exhibit antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and viruses (Table 1) .

Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), also known as RNase 2, has demonstrated inhibitory activity against RSV in several studies. In one study, RSV infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner when eosinophils were introduced to a suspension of RSV [121] . This property was abolished upon addition of a ribonuclease inhibitor suggesting that an RNase was responsible for the antiviral activity. At 50 nM, a plasmid-constructed recombinant human EDN exhibited a 40-fold reduction in RSV infectivity [121] . A decrease in RSV genomic RNA copies as quantified by RT-PCR upon incubation of EDN with virions suggests EDN ribonuclease activity directly targets extracellular viral particles. EDN may contain unique features that help mediate its antiviral activity as ribonuclease A alone has no effect on RSV infectivity.

Additionally, ECP, which is also known as RNase 3, has been detected in infants with acute bronchiolitis following RSV infection [122] . ECP levels were significantly higher in infants who developed persistent wheezing compared to those that do not after a five-year follow-up [122] . Additionally, while ECP was able to reduce RSV infectivity in the same suspension as EDN, ECP is less effective when used to inhibit RSV alone, demonstrating only a six-fold reduction as compared to EDN at a concentration of 50 nM [121] . Hence while ECP exhibits some inhibitory activity against RSV, it is not sufficient in controlling infection as RSV infection itself induces the production of ECP with no evident antiviral effects. Instead, the production of ECP in infants with bronchiolitis can be used as tool in prediction the risk of wheezing cough development in those infants as higher ECP levels correlate with wheezing cough development.

In earlier studies, EDN did not demonstrate direct activity against HIV; However, it indirectly induces the production of HIV-inhibiting molecules. Soluble factors produced by hosts such as chemokines, interferons, RNases, and alloantigen-stimulated factors (ASF) have been reported to inhibit HIV-1 replication or binding [123] . A test to determine the soluble HIV-1 inhibitory activity utilized supernatants from mixed lymphocytes of healthy individuals that exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity. While the supernatant exhibited anti-HIV activity, this activity was blocked with antibodies specific for EDN by 58% [123] . Antibodies to RNase A had no effect on the anti-HIV-1 activity, thus ruling out its involvement. In addition, an RNase inhibitor significantly blocked the inhibitory activity indicating that EDN or a possible closely-related RNase is responsible for the HIV-1 inhibitory activity [123] . Later studies reported EDN and a recombinant EDN, containing a four amino acid extension of the N-terminus of END, both exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity independent of time of addition, before, during, or 2 h post infection [124] .

Immune cells have the ability to produce AMPs such as the protease inhibitors elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) [3] . Studies investigating AMPs produced by gamma-delta T cells (γδ T cells), recorded production of elafin [125] . Elafin is expressed in tissues such as skin, placenta, genital and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as by cells including neutrophils, epithelial cells, macrophages, and keratinocytes and thus can be found at many surfaces and in secretions [126] . Elafin is a 57-amino-acid single-polypeptide chain produced by the proteolytic cleavage of a precursor molecule called trappin-2 [127, 128] . Similarly, SLPI is expressed by neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells of renal tubules and respiratory/alimentary tracts [129] . This peptide can be found in saliva, cervical mucus, breast milk, cerebral spinal fluid, tears, and secretions from nose and bronchi [129] . SLPI is a 107-amino-acid, cysteine-rich polypeptide chain that is highly basic [129] . The C-terminals of elafin and SLPI exhibit both high homology and similar protease activity [127] and have demonstrated antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activities (Table 1) [129, 130] .

Elafin and its precursor trappin-2 (Tr) both exhibit anti-HSV activity. Drannik and colleagues (2013) investigated the efficacy of elafin and Tr on HSV-2 infection using a Tr-expressing, replication-deficient adenovirus vector as well as recombinant TR/elafin proteins. Cells were either infected with the adenovirus vector or treated with the recombinant proteins prior to HSV-2 infection. When endometrial and endocervical epithelial cells were pre-treated with these molecules (TR IC 50~0 .07 µg/mL, E IC 50~0 .01 µg/mL), viral titers following HSV-2 infection were significantly reduced, with the activity of Tr being more potent at inhibiting HSV-2 than elafin [126] . A decrease in viral titers correlated with a decrease in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the antiviral IFN-β response was increased. Furthermore, the recombinant molecules decreased viral attachment to cells [126] . In vivo, Tr-transgenic mice, mice generated to express the full elafin/Tr human gene, demonstrated reduced central nervous system viral load and TNF-α expression upon intravaginal infection [126] . The data provides evidence for elafin and its precursor's potential as anti-HSV therapeutics.

Both proteases, elafin and SLPI, can provide protection against HIV-1 in vitro. SLPI in saliva has demonstrated anti-HIV-1 properties in vitro [131] . Genital secretions of females that are HIV-resistant contained significantly higher levels of elafin/Tr as compared to uninfected females [132] [133] [134] . In addition, elafin/Tr is found in and produced by epithelial cells of uterine, fallopian tubes, and cervix [132] . Ghosh et al. (2010) [132] investigated the ability of elafin/Tr in the reproductive tract to inhibit HIV-1and demonstrated HIV-1 inhibition was dose-dependent, particularly when HIV-1 was pre-incubated with elafin/Tr (10 ng/mL), suggesting the HIV-1 inhibition is mediated by direct interaction of elafin/Tr with the virus [132] . However, a recent report on multiple groups of HIV-infected women found no correlation between anti-HIV activity of mediators such as elafin and HIV susceptibility [135] .

Hepcidin, also known as human liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-1 (LEAP-1), is a 25-amino acids long AMP that is predominately expressed by liver hepatocytes [136] . It was first isolated in human blood filtrates. Hepcidin is synthesized as a pre-propeptide with two cleavage sites. The first cleavage site releases an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence while the second cleavage site releases the mature hepcidin peptide from a prodomain [136] . Hepcidin plays a major role in iron regulation and in systemic iron homeostasis in hepatocytes and other cells [136] [137] [138] . Hepcidin regulates iron uptake and efflux by directly binding to the iron exporter ferroportin, resulting in degradation of this transporter [137] . Consequently, high levels of hepcidin result in inhibition of iron uptake and sequestration of blood iron in macrophages, whereas low levels of hepcidin result in excessive uptake and toxic accumulation of dietary iron [137, 138] . Hence, increased serum iron levels increase hepcidin expression. The vital role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis can determine the outcome of infections by limiting iron availability to invading pathogens.

Relatively little information is available on the effects of hepcidin on the pathogenesis of viral infections; however, hepcidin induction has been reported following a number of human and murine viral infections [137, 138] . Hepcidin mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice during influenza virus PR8 infection [139] . This induction appeared to be IL-6 dependent as IL-6 knockout mice did not induce the expression of hepcidin mRNA. In addition, in primary hepatocytes that were stimulated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), hepcidin was inhibited by the addition of IL-6 neutralizing antibodies [139] . These results indicate that hepcidin expression is increased following viral infections and infection-induced inflammatory responses, particularly IL-6 due to the central role this cytokine plays in hepcidin production.

Liver injury as well as chronic liver infections, such as hepatitis B and C, can result in abnormal hepcidin expression. Hepcidin expression was found to be highly elevated in chronic hepatitis B and C patients, as reported by Wang and colleagues (2013) . In patients with increased HBV DNA, hepcidin and IL-6 levels were elevated; however, an exact correlation between hepcidin and IL-6 was not determined [140] . In contrast, in studies assessing hepcidin levels in HBV and HCV acute infections during primary viremic phases, hepcidin levels were not upregulated and hypoferremia was not evident [141] . This difference could be attributed to the different stages of disease where hepcidin may be induced at later stages of infection when iron levels are elevated. In the same study Armitage et al. also measured hepcidin levels in HIV-1 positive plasma donors of both acute infections and patients transitioning to chronic infections. In the former group, hepcidin levels were increased and peaked with peak viral load and iron levels decreased due to retention in cells by hepcidin activity; whereas in the latter group, hepcidin levels remained elevated even in individuals undergoing ART [141] . The increase in hepcidin levels coincided with an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression [141] . HIV replication is iron-dependent and the hepcidin-induced sequestering of iron in cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages is a highly favorable condition for HIV pathogenesis.

Neuropeptides (NPs) are low molecular weight, cationic, amphipathic AMPs. Traditionally NPs are thought to transmit and modulate signals in central and peripheral nervous systems. However, in recent years, NPs have demonstrated antimicrobial activities [142, 143] . The NP, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) exhibits both antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity (Table 1) . α-MSH is a 13-amino acid peptide that is a product of posttranslational processing of the precursor molecule pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) [144] . α-MSH is widely expressed in peripheral brain tissue and by numerous cells including monocytes, dendritic cells, melanocytes, pituitary cells as well as T lymphocytes [142, 144] . The active component of α-MSH resides in the C-terminal tripeptide (11-13, KPV) [144] .

In HIV-infected monocytes, α-MSH exhibited inhibitory properties against HIV-1. Previously, α-MSH inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNFα and IL-1β in blood from HIV-infected individuals [145] . Barcellini et al. [55] aimed to determine if α-MSH exhibits anti-HIV properties by utilizing chronically infected monocytic U1 cells and acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages. Not only did U1 cells consistently produce α-MSH, but α-MSH and the tripeptide (KPV) both (10 µM) inhibited HIV expression at low concentrations comparable to physiological concentrations of α-MSH, with inhibition more pronounced at higher concentrations [146] . In addition, both peptides inhibited nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation which is known to enhance HIV viral protein expression.

In recent years the antiviral properties of AMPs, both naturally occurring and synthetic, and their therapeutic potential have generated increasing interest within the academic and pharmaceutical communities. Many of the AMPs originally thought to demonstrate only antibacterial activity have been found to exhibit antiviral and immune modulatory capabilities. While to date few AMP-based therapies have been clinically approved, so far, the suitability and efficacy of only a few AMPs as therapeutic agents has been studied in clinical trials as treatments for infections as well as agents for immune modulations [147] . Clinical studies utilizing AMPs include defensin-mimetic compounds (CTIX 1278) for the treatment of drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, an alpha-helical AMP (PL-5) for gram negative and positive bacterial skin infections, and a cationic peptide (DPK 060) for skin dermatitis [148] . AMPs are promising therapeutics due to their relatively low toxicity and tolerance in vivo. AMPs can be delivered in a variety of ways including intravenous injections, oral administration, as topical ointments, and via inhalation. In respiratory tract infections, supplementation and treatment with AMPs such as defensins and LL-37 may provide protection in the lungs. For example, nebulizing mice with LL-37 prior to infection with IAV can reduce disease severity and result in increased survival rates [50] . The same concept could be applied against other respiratory pathogens such RSV and rhinovirus with the inclusion of AMPs such as lactoferrin and EDN, which have both previously demonstrated efficacy against RSV [79, 121] .

AMPs can also be applied as ointments, gels, or creams. For instance, a gel for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis currently in clinical trials is derived from human α-MSH [147] . As α-MSH has previously demonstrated antiviral activity against HIV [146] , this form of treatment could be developed into a cheap and effective strategy to reduce HIV transmission. The treatment can be expanded to other sexually transmitted diseases, such as HSV, and include many of the other classes of AMPs demonstrating antiviral activity against those particular viruses. Equally, oral formulations or intravenous injections are more feasible for viral infections affecting internal organs. Lactoferrin has been used as an oral supplement to antiviral therapy against HCV infections and greatly enhances the effectiveness of treatment [98] . While most studies utilizing oral LF against other pathogens alone have not provided promising results, different AMPs may prove more effective against different pathogens. An intravenous treatment of human LF is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of bacteremia and fungal infections [147] . Interestingly, the protease inhibitor Telaprevir, which is marketed for use against HCV suggests that eosinophil peptides that have dual functionality as protease inhibitors and AMPs may possess anti-HCV properties. In addition, AMPs that directly target viruses can serve as alternatives to antivirals for which resistance has become an issue as it is a challenge for viruses to change their envelope lipid compositions. Nonetheless, more research and investigation are required to assess the full potential of AMPs as novel therapeutics.

However, despite their appeal and several successful in vitro outcomes following the use of AMPs as antiviral therapeutics, their greater application as therapeutics faces many hurdles. Little clinical data on the use, toxicity, efficacy, methods of delivery, or host uptake and the in vivo response to AMPs is currently available to guide the development of AMPs into therapeutic products [147, 149] . It is unclear whether and to what extent laboratory findings will translate into antiviral activity in vivo. Additionally, the relationship between peptide concentrations used in vitro experiments and physiologically effective concentrations required for in vivo activity is unknown for many AMPs. As an example, the anti-bacterial activities of AMPs appear to heavily depend on the environmental conditions used during experiments [147] . Several AMPs have been reported to control group A Streptococcus at physiological concentrations which are ineffective in vitro [150] , suggested to be partly due to the physiological ionic environment not being recapitulated fully in laboratory experiments [151] . Moreover, AMPs minimally active in in vitro assays have been shown to efficiently control infections upon in vivo administration [152, 153] , highlighting a lack of clear correlation between efficacy and dose-dependence of AMPs derived from laboratory experiments and animal models of infection. Further research into the correlation between antiviral activity of AMPs in vitro and the translation of this activity into in vivo efficacy will be needed for further development of AMPs as a new class of therapeutics.

Another important challenge is isolation and large scale manufacturing of AMPs. The high cost of producing AMPs impedes the applicability for clinical use as a commercial-scale manufacturing platform does not yet exists. The complex secondary structures of AMPs also serve as an obstacle for large-scale production as their activity is structure-based. The use of expression systems such as bacterial systems can generate ""correctly folded peptides"" in large quantities; however, the peptides are susceptible to proteolytic degradation in these systems [17] . To turn AMPs into viable therapeutics for clinical use, these production disadvantages must be overcome. Meanwhile, as an alternative, non-human AMPs are being used. For example, numerous studies are examining the activity of LF utilize bovine instead of human LF due to ease of producing bovine LF in bulk. While bovine LF demonstrates equivalent and at times enhanced efficacy, as compared to the human form, other AMPs may not function similarly or may contain sequence variations that limit or abolish their properties. Synthetic peptides may prove to be a practical alternative; however, they are expensive to generate, and future use in therapies will require development of novel synthesis methods [154, 155] . Several systems have demonstrated promise in mass-production of AMPs including mammalian cells and transgenic plants. While mammalian cell culture systems are preferred to produce human AMPs, they are not very cost-effective. Plant bioreactors; however, are a cost-effective method for commercial-scale AMPs production that have demonstrated applicability with other compounds [17] . Another interesting approach that could possibly counteract these challenges that has recently gained attention is the employment of agents to induce or increase expression of AMPs. For example, vitamin D induces LL-37 production that can be used to boost the natural response to infection and has been suggested for use prior to potential DENV outbreaks [43] .

Furthermore, the metabolic stability of AMPs may limit their future clinical application [156] [157] [158] . There is a lack of data assessing the pharmacokinetics of AMPs to address issues such as the physiological half-life of peptides, the necessary dosing regiments, and the aggregation of peptides in vivo. For example, AMPs in oral and topical formulations will be subjected to enzymatic degradation, changes in pH and ionic concentrations, and face hurdles upon delivery, such as penetration of and uptake from the skin, intestinal, or nasal mucosa [159] . Intravenous administered AMPs will also face proteolytic degradation from enzymes in plasma and tissues, although the relatively shorter half-life of AMPs when compared to small-molecule drugs may be considered beneficial in some contexts due to lack of accumulation in tissues [159] . In addition, some AMPs are sensitive to salt or serum, a factor that substantially reduces their activity further limiting their applicability in clinical use.

The delivery of sufficient amounts of AMPs to an infection site may also present challenges and require careful calibration of dosing. For example, topical application of AMPs to the skin may require large-scale application of ointments, raising issues about sensitization and development of allergies against applied AMPs. Similarly, AMP activity in the context of natural innate immunity occurs in the presence numerous feedback pathways that collectively calibrate the anti-pathogen response to an appropriate level. It remains to be determined how the introduction of potentially high doses of AMPs during infections will interact with these pathways and modulate the activity of AMP therapeutics, especially as synthetic AMPs appear to elicit weaker immune responses upon administration when compared to the response produced by naturally secreted peptides during infection [160] .

While these challenges may considerably impede clinical development of AMPs, the incorporation of innovative formulations can speed the process of bringing AMP products to clinical phases. The use of nanoparticles (NPs) as delivery vehicles may greatly improve the metabolic stability of AMPs. Nanoparticles can provide unique advantages, such as protection of AMPs from proteolytic degradation and control over the rate of peptide release. Several nanoparticles have been evaluated for delivery of AMPs. For example, self-assembling hyaluronic acid (HA) nanogels have been used to successfully deliver LLLKKK18, an analog of LL-37 via intra-tracheal administration in tuberculosis-infected mice [161] . Additionally, the HA nanocarrier was able to both stabilize the peptide and decrease peptide cytotoxicity in macrophages in vitro [161] . Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PGLA) NPs were also successfully utilized to deliver cationic AMPS [162] . Although these formulations have only been investigated in experimental animal models and in vitro applications, the outcomes for developing future AMP-based therapeutics appear promising.

Progress has been made in the last decade to elucidate the mechanisms of action of various AMPs. The primary mechanism of AMP-mediated antiviral activity has been attributed to direct interference with, and destabilization of, viral envelopes. However, AMPs have also demonstrated selective immune modulation. Antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been reported with the latter hinting at the presence of undiscovered activities of AMPs, in addition to the known direct interaction with viral envelopes. Indeed, antiviral activity has also been reported at post entry steps affecting later stages in the viral life cycle, such as genome replication and viral protein trafficking. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that AMP treatment prior to viral infection results in peptide retention and internalization by cells which may reflect a more robust response to viruses compared to other potential therapeutics in development. Additionally, post-infection treatments have been reported to exhibit antiviral activity; however, to a lesser extent to that of treatments prior to infection. Nonetheless, these treatments play a role in altering viral replication and assembly as well as a role in accelerating immune activation or suppression. Hence, AMPs can directly impact viral infections or can modulate host processes that ultimately impact viral replication negatively. AMPs have been reported to drive interferon β (IFNβ) signaling, contributing to the induction of an antiviral state in susceptible cells. This dual functionality of AMPs is advantageous as they can be used as a prophylactic and/or as part of post-exposure antiviral measures. In vulnerable individuals, prophylactic expression of AMPs has the potential to become a preventative strategy against viral infections, especially during emerging pandemics. In addition, the simplicity of AMPs makes the development of synthetic peptide analogues a cost-effective measure to treat established viral infections.

AMPs and their synthetic derivatives are a promising avenue to yield new strategies to control and treat a wide range of viral diseases but their application is still at the preliminary stages. Therefore, further research is warranted to understand AMP antiviral activity both in vivo and in vitro and to determine underlying mechanisms involved in AMP-mediated immune modulation for clinical applications.

Antiviral Drugs Specific for Coronaviruses in Preclinical Development,"Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including humans. Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses impeded the development of coronavirus specific therapeutics. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and more recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has impelled the development of such drugs. This review focuses on some newly identified SARS-CoV inhibitors, with known mechanisms of action and their potential to inhibit the novel MERS-CoV. The clinical development of optimized versions of such compounds could be beneficial for the treatment and control of SARS-CoV, the current MERS-CoV and other future SARS-like epidemics.","In September 2012, a novel coronavirus (CoV) called Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), was isolated as the causative agent of a severe pneumonia in several patients in the Middle East [1] . [1] . Globally, as of May 16, 2014, WHO has been informed of a total of 614 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV (including 181 deaths) primarily in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates), but also in Europe (the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Greece), North Africa (Tunisia and Egypt), Asia (Malaysia) and the United States of America (http:// www.who.int/csr/don/2014_05_16_mers/en/, http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/ ). This CoV is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), an epidemic that was short-lived but alarming in 2002-2003 that resulted in approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both belong to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with approximately 30,000 nucleotides [2**] . CoVs represent the largest RNA viruses. For the well-characterized SARS-CoV, two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), encompass approximately two-thirds of the genome. A translational read-through by a -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism allows the translation of the overlapping reading frames into a single polyprotein pp1ab, whereas, translation without the -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism produces pp1a. The polyproteins are later cleaved by two viral proteinases, 3C-like protease (3CLP) and papain-like protease (PLP), to yield non-structural proteins essential for viral replication [3, 4] . The remaining one-third of the genome encodes structural proteins of the virus, which include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5, 6] .

Based on phylogenic analyses, evolutionary studies have shown that SARS-CoV originated most likely from bats. It has been reported to be transmitted to humans by aerosols through intermediate hosts like palm civets infected by the virus [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, the zoonosis of CoV is a threat, due to its ability of interspecies transfer into human population. This has been recapitulated with the novel MERS-CoV, as recent studies have suggested that bats and dromedary camels serve as a reservoir for this virus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . MERS-CoV shows SARS-like symptoms following human infections, which include malaise, rigors, fatigues and high fevers, indications similar to influenza, but later progresses to atypical pneumonia in most cases [16] .

Although, many antiviral agents have been identified to inhibit SARS in vitro, there are presently, no approved antiviral agents or vaccines available to tackle any potential SARS or SARS-like outbreaks, such as MERS. Different parts of the virus, that are deemed viable targets include, 3CLP, PLP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the 5′-3′ helicase [17] [18] [19] [18*]. Other possible targets include E protein (Orf4), M protein (Orf6), and N protein (Orf9) [17] . This review focuses on the published antiviral inhibitors of coronaviruses, with SARS-CoV being considered as the primary virus. The inhibitors include replication and entry inhibitors, which can be developed for therapeutic purposes, not just against SARS, but other coronaviruses, including the novel MERS-CoV.

The first coronavirus proteins that have been studied in detail include viral proteinases, namely the papain-like protease (PLP) or nsp3 and the 3C-like protease (3CLP, nsp5 or Mpro), which cleave the polyprotein into individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription [3, 4] . Following the translation of the messenger RNA to yield the polyproteins, the 3CLP is first auto-cleaved from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme. The 3CLP further cleaves all the 11 remaining downstream non-structural proteins. Hence, 3CLP is an essential viral protein for the viral replication cycle, and as a result becomes an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development [20] [21] [22] [21**]. 3CLP inhibitors are among the first SARS-CoV inhibitors that were discovered by screening compound libraries using an assay that utilizes a fluorogenic peptide as the substrate and with structure-based design based on the crystal structures of the product-bound form of 3CLP [23] [24] [25] . The compounds identified include zinc or mercury conjugates [26, 27] , C2symmetric diols [28, 29] , peptidomimetic α,β-unsaturated esters [30] , anilides [31] , benzotriazole [32] , N-phenyl-2-(2-pyrimidinylthio)acetamide [33] , biphenyl sulfone [34] , glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethylketone group [35] , pyrimidinone [36] , and pyrazole analogues that can also inhibit 3Cpro of picornaviruses CV-B3 (coxsackievirus), EV-71 (enterovirus) and RV-14 (rhinovirus) (coronavirus and picornavirus dual inhibitors) [24, 25] . The names and chemical structures of some of the published 3C-protease inhibitors are shown in Figure 1 .

The papain like protease (PLP) is also an essential component of the SARS-CoV replication machinery. PLP is the nsp3 protein which is part of the synthesized ORF1a polyprotein during replication. nsp3 cleaves protease recognition sites between nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 [37] . In addition to its protease activity, nsp3 has been shown to have deubiquitination, and interferon antagonist activities in vitro [38] . Since its homologues are found in all coronaviruses, it has also been proposed to be a good target for drug discovery for both SARS-CoV and other human coronaviruses.

Recently, Frieman et al. [39] developed a yeast-based assay to screen for small molecules that block SARS-CoV replication based on their inhibition of nsp3 or PLP. The basis for the screen was that stimulated expression of nsp3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a pronounced slow growth phenotype. Using this principle, they screened a small molecule library for compounds that specifically prevented the nsp3-induced slow growth phenotype. These compounds were then validated in cell culture models for efficacy against SARS-CoV replication, as well as the known enzymatic functions of nsp3. The authors found five compounds that reversed the slow growth phenotype in yeast. One of the compounds, NSC158362 (Fig. 1G) , considerably blocked SARS-CoV replication in vitro with an EC 50 < 1 μM. This effect was specific for SARS-CoV replication because no effect on influenza virus replication was observed with up to 50 μM of the inhibitory compound. Another compound, NSC158011, was shown to inhibit nsp3-dependent protease activity in a cell culture assay, but could not prevent virus replication. NSC158362, could not inhibit the protease, deubiquitinase or anti-IFN activities of nsp3, therefore suggesting that the compound may be inhibiting a yet unknown novel activity of nsp3 required for viral replication or may be inhibiting some cellular factors that regulate nsp3 function in infected cells.

Helicases are proteins that catalyze the separation of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an ATP-dependent reaction. Based on this activity, helicases can be divided into two types: those that unwind duplexes in a 3′→5′ direction, and those that unwind in a 5′→3′ direction. Helicases require a molecular mechanism for transducing the chemical energy generated by the ATPase activity into an oligonucleotide strand separation and displacement activity [40] . The functions of helicase in positivesense RNA viruses include nucleic acid separations [41**], the melting of highly stable secondary structures within the genomic RNA in order to increase translational efficiency of the polyprotein [42] . Considering all these helicase functions, viral helicases stand as a strong antiviral target.

The helicase of SARS-CoV is called nsp13. A few potential inhibitors of nsp13 have been identified [19, [43] [44] [45] [46] . Some of these inhibitors inhibit nsp13 by interfering with its unwinding and ATPase activities. They include the bananins and the 5-hydroxychromone derivatives [43, 45] . The bananins are a class of antiviral compounds with an exclusive structural signature that incorporates a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative [45] . Six members of this class of compounds were synthesized by Tanner et al [45] . The compounds are bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, ansabananin, eubananin, and adeninobananin. Of the six compounds, bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin effectively inhibited the helicase activity of nsp13 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of the helicase with IC 50 values in the range 0.5-3 μM. Bananin was also shown to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in a cell culture assay, with an EC50 of less than 10 μM [45] . The structure of vanillinbananin is shown in Figure 2A . For the 5-hydroxychromone derivatives, 5-hydroxychromone was used as a scaffold on which two arylmethyloxy substituents were installed. The resulting derivatives include 5-hydroxy-6-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-chromone with chloro-or iodo-benzyloxy substituents [43] (Fig. 2B) . These compounds, similar to the bananins, also inhibited the unwinding activities of SARS-CoV nsp13 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of the helicase at comparable EC 50 s of ∼10 μM [43] . While these compounds portend to be a promising therapy, the potential ability of these compounds to inhibit the ATPase activity of cellular ATPases or kinases may affect cellular activities, thereby creating a risk of cytotoxicity. A study reported that an aryl diketoacid compound (Fig. 2C ) selectively inhibited the duplex DNA unwinding activity of SARS-CoV nsp13 without significantly inhibiting its ATPase activity [44] . However, the effects of this compound on nsp13's unwinding activity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the replication of SARS-CoV were not determined [44] .

A recent report revealed an inhibitor of nsp13 that inhibited the unwinding, but not the ATPase enzymatic and nucleic acid binding activities of nsp13 [19] . Using biochemical analyses, the authors demonstrated that this compound, SSYA10-001 (Fig. 2D) , is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to its major substrates, namely, nucleic acids and ATP. Since this compound did not inhibit nsp13's binding and hydrolysis of nucleic acids and ATP, coupled with the fact that it did not bind the nucleic acid substrate, the authors suggested that, SSYA10-001 may be inhibiting nsp13 unwinding activity by interfering with its conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid [19] . Moreover, SSYA10-001 was also shown to be an efficient inhibitor of viral replication in a SARS-CoV replicon and live viral assays. More recently, SSYA10-001 was shown to exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against other coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [47] .

Viral entry is an essential step of the virus replication cycle that can be targeted for therapy [48] . Entry inhibitors of several viruses have been identified. Examples include: RFI 641 and VP-14637, which are small molecules that inhibit the entry of respiratory syncytial virus by binding at a hydrophobic pocket of the fusion (F) glycoprotein [49, 50] ; some inhibitors have been reported to block HIV entry by using different strategies. Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor of HIV that targets CCR5, a host protein used as a coreceptor during HIV entry [51] [52] [53] . Enfuvirtide and SC29EK are peptides that can also block viral entry by binding to the viral transmembrane protein gp41 and blocking the final stage of fusion with the target cell [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . A few monoclonal antibodies are currently in clinical trials, and they include KD-247 and PRO140. They prevent HIV entry by binding either the viral surface glycoprotein gp120 [60, 61] or the CCR5 coreceptor [62, 63] .

The surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, SARS-S, has two constituents: S1, which comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which comprises the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV gains entry into permissive cells through interactions of the SARS-S RBD with the cell surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Fig. 3) [20, 64] . Following these interactions, endocytosis occurs. When the endosomes are within the region of low pH in the cell, SARS-S is cleaved by a cellular protease called cathepsin L (Fig. 4) , leading to the exposure of the S2 domain of the spike protein for membrane fusion [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [67, 69**]. Some reports have also suggested the possibility of the fusion of SARS-Sexpressing cells with ACE2 receptor-expressing cells in a pH-independent environment at the cell surface [71, 72] .

The possible targets for SARS viral entry, thus, include cathepsin L, ACE2-SARS-S1 interaction and S2-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 3) . A number of studies have identified some inhibitors that interfere with these targets. Dipeptide epoxyketones, calpain inhibitor III, oxocarbazate, MDL28170 and SSAA09E1 are all cathepsin L inhibitors (Fig. 4) [67, [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [76**]. While the first four compounds are peptidomimetic in nature ( Fig. 4A-C) , SSAA09E1 (Fig. 4D ) is a small molecule cathepsin L inhibitor that is likely to have improved bioavailability over others. These compounds have been shown to inhibit SARS viral entry by hindering the ability of cathepsin L to cleave S1 from S2, thereby preventing the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, following endocytosis. Other SARS viral entry inhibitors include SSAA09E2 (Fig. 4E) [78] act by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Fig.  3) . NAAE is a unique small molecule entry inhibitor in that, it inhibits both ACE2 catalytic activity and S-protein-induced cell-cell fusion [78] . While dual inhibitory effects on ACE2 catalytic activity and SARS-CoV binding is not expected, because the catalytic site of ACE2 is distinct from the S-protein-binding domain [71] [79**], NAAE did show antiviral activity. Overexpression of ACE has been shown to cause hypertension, which is counterbalanced by ACE2 (through vasodilation) [80] . Hence, inhibition of ACE2 by NAAE stands as a potential risk for hypertension.

Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. During the initial outbreak of SARS, a number of medications that included ribavirin with and without corticosteroids [81] [82] [83] , interferon (alfacon-1) with corticosteroids [84] , and ribavirin with protease inhibitors [85] had some encouraging outcomes, but a definitive treatment regimen was not clearly established. More recently, a combination of IFN-α2b and ribavirin were shown to have some in vitro synergistic activities against MERS-CoV, albeit at higher concentrations [86] . These drugs have known pharmacological properties and are, therefore, widely available, as some of them are used for the treatment of some viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus, albeit with some adverse side effects including hemolytic anemia, elevated transaminase levels and bradycardia [83] , depression, suicide, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, bacterial infections and many others (Interferon and ribavirin treatment side effects, http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/treatment-side-effects.asp#S1X). Hence, with the new outbreak of MERS-CoV infection, optimization and development of some of the aforementioned lead compounds or other inhibitors with known or new mechanisms of action becomes important for therapeutic purposes, as there are no reports of any compound in clinical trials.

• Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that cause systemic diseases in humans and animals.

• There are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections.

• Several SARS-CoV inhibitors, with known mechanisms of action, have been identified.

• These inhibitors stand as promising leads for coronavirus therapeutics.

Viruses as anticancer drugs,Oncolytic viruses are being developed as anticancer drugs.,"Viruses are nature's nanoparticles -a vast untapped bioresource. More than 2400 viral species are known, with extraordinarily diverse morphologies and biochemical compositions [1, 2] . Their diameters range from 20 to 500 nm, and their genomes from 3000 to 375 000 nucleotides. They have single-or double-stranded RNA or DNA genomes packaged into icosahedral or helical protein shells, which are sometimes wrapped in a lipid envelope. The particle protects the viral genome, carries it from cell to cell in the infected host organism and transmits it from infected to uninfected hosts. Once delivered into a susceptible target cell, the viral genome usurps the cellular biosynthetic machinery to manufacture progeny viruses that spread to adjacent cells, leading to a characteristic pattern of tissue destruction. This provokes innate and adaptive immune responses (cellular and humoral), which combat the infection and protect the host from future exposures to the same virus. From one pharmacological perspective, the viral genome can be seen as a new class of tissuedestructive drug, and the viral particle as a nanosized nucleic acid delivery vehicle.

virus was the H101 type 5 adenovirus, which carries E1B-55KD and partial E3 gene deletions. Approval was granted based on superior response rates in head and neck cancer patients treated with combined intratumoral H101 plus chemotherapy compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone. Durability of these responses was not determined and prolongation of survival was not shown [5] . Numerous additional oncolytic viruses are currently in Phase I and II clinical testing in many different countries. However, for viruses to be more widely approved and used as anticancer drugs, they will have to meet stringent criteria for safety and efficacy, and should be amenable to pharmacological study in human subjects. These three issues are the subject of this review, exemplified where possible by reference to oncolytic measles viruses because these are the agents that are most intensively studied in our laboratories.

For safety, oncolytic viruses must be highly cancer specific, causing minimal damage and destruction to normal tissues. Consideration should also be given to the possibility that an oncolytic virus could evolve into a pathogen as it propagates in the patient, and to the possibility of person-to-person transmission, either of the original oncolytic virus or of a pathogenic derivative [6, 7] . All possible steps should be taken to minimize these risks, including the development of a 'worst-case scenario' contingency plan.

The specificity problem has been effectively addressed and we are currently blessed with a diverse armamentarium of oncolytic viruses with proven ability to propagate selectively in tumor tissue (Table 1) . A few are naturally oncolytic [8] or have serendipitously evolved during tissue culture passage to become oncolytic [9] , but most have been engineered in some way to enhance their tumor specificity. Targeting mechanisms that have been exploited to date can be classified into the four broad categories of transcriptional, translational, transductional and pro-apoptotic. Each of these mechanisms is further explained below in relation to the viral replication cycle (Box 1). Each of the targeting mechanisms is shown in Figure 1 .

Adenoviruses can be rendered tumor selective by mutating or deleting their E1 genes, whose products are essential for virus propagation in normal cells but not in tumor cells [10, 11] . The E1a and E1b gene products prevent apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in the infected cells by inhibiting p53 and Rb, respectively. Normal cells undergo rapid Rb-induced cell-cycle arrest and p53-induced apoptosis when infected by an oncolytic adenovirus lacking E1 functions, and the propagation of the virus is, thereby, aborted. However, in tumor cells in which the p53 and Rb proteins are frequently nonfunctional, the E1-deleted adenovirus can still propagate efficiently without fear of triggering premature apoptosis [12, 13] .

This targeting strategy provides a way to exploit defects in interferon signaling pathways in tumor cells. Virus infections tend to provoke the induction of type I interferons but successful viruses suppress this response (Box 1). When viruses are mutated to destroy their interferon suppression mechanisms, the release of interferon from the infected cell signals to neighboring cells to shut down protein synthesis, leading to the establishment of an antiviral state. In contrast to normal cells, tumor cells have defective interferon signaling pathways and, therefore, remain susceptible to the virus, even after exposure to interferon. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection provokes transcription of interferon genes but the virally encoded matrix (M) protein, by inhibiting mRNA transport, blocks the synthesis and release of active interferons. VSVs can, therefore, be rendered nonpathogenic by mutating the M protein so that it no longer inhibits interferon release [14] or by inserting an interferon gene into the VSV genome [15] . These nonpathogenic VSVs are still oncolytic because tumor cells are defective in their ability to produce and respond to interferon and, therefore, efficiently support the propagation of the defective viruses [16] . A second translational targeting approach, employed recently and with good effect to develop an oncolytic poliovirus, is to restrict the expression of viral genes by placing them under the control of a tissue-specific internal ribosome entry site [17] . Box 1. Virus replication Attachment is the first step in the virus life cycle ( Figure I ). Attachment proteins on the surface of the virion interact with specific receptors on the surface of the target cell. Attachment provides the trigger for entry, wherein the viral genome is delivered into the cytoplasm of the target cell. Entry occurs by membrane fusion for enveloped viruses and by endosomal disruption or particle translocation across the target cell membrane for non-enveloped viruses. Once inside the infected cell, viral genomes are transported to specific nuclear or cytoplasmic destinations where they can be expressed and replicated. The viral genome is then copied and amplified, the viral genes are expressed and the structural proteins are assembled to form new virus particles, which interact with the packaging signal sequences in the progeny viral genomes to form fully infectious, nucleic-acid-carrying progeny virus particles that are released from the cell. Viral genes encoding nonstructural and structural proteins are typically expressed sequentially. The nonstructural proteins, which are expressed earliest, have several functions. They drive the amplification of the viral genome, induce the expression of the structural (late) proteins and maintain the viability of the target cell long enough so that it can make viable progeny viruses.

The first response of a cell, upon sensing that it has been infected by a virus, is to 'scream' by releasing IFN-β. Surrounding uninfected cells respond to the interferon signal by activating their viral defense mechanisms and suppressing their translational machinery so that they become poor substrates to support virus propagation. The second response of the infected cell is to activate its apoptotic program so that it will die before it releases progeny viruses. Unsurprisingly, viruses have evolved to suppress both apoptosis and the interferon response using many different mechanisms. Infected cells are, thereby, 'bound', 'gagged' and exploited as virus-producing factories.

Adenoviruses, herpes viruses and retroviruses can be rendered tumor selective by inserting tissue-specific or tumor-specific promoters in their genomes to regulate the expression of viral genes, whose products are essential for virus propagation. For adenoviruses, this has been achieved by placing the E1 gene under the control of a foreign promoter [10, 11] . For oncolytic herpes viruses, transcriptional targeting efforts have focused on γ34.1, one of the key early genes [18] . For retroviruses, the U3 promoter-enhancer region in the long terminal repeat has been replaced [19] .

Virus attachment proteins can be adapted to use receptors that are expressed preferentially or exclusively on tumor cell surfaces or to mediate virus entry only when exposed to proteases that are abundant in the tumor microenvironment [20] . Both of these approaches have been extensively validated using recombinant measles viruses [21, 22] . The measles virus has two envelope glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (H) attachment protein and the fusion (F) protein.

To redirect virion binding to tumor-associated receptors, ligands such as growth factors and single-chain antibodies are inserted as C-terminal extensions of the H protein, mutated to ablate its interactions with measles receptors, CD46 and SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule). These fully re-targeted viruses can infect and kill only those cells expressing the cognate receptor for the displayed ligand. In a second transductional targeting approach, protease-sensitive linkers are inserted into the F protein (between F1 and F2) so that proteolytic maturation of the F protein occurs exclusively at sites at which the protease is abundantly expressed. Measles viruses that can be selectively activated by tumorassociated matrix metalloproteinases have recently been described [22] .

Viruses evolve by mutation and selection [23] . Viral mutation rates are generally relatively high (higher for RNA viruses than for DNA viruses) such that many, if not most, viruses in a 'pure' virus preparation carry a point mutation somewhere in their genome. A virotherapy product cannot, therefore, be so precisely defined as a small molecule because it is actually a swarm of quasispecies that are closely related, but not identical, to a consensus product [24] . Under selective pressure in the treated cancer patient, these viruses or their in vivo progeny might acquire the ability to infect non-target tissues, to evade the host immune response or to spread from the patient to their carers. These risks are likely to vary greatly depending on the biology and prevalence of the oncolytic virus in question. The risk of oncolytic virus transmission from a treated patient to their carer is expected to be higher when the virus is derived from an animal pathogen than when it is derived from a human vaccine. Oncolytic measles viruses are considered extremely safe in this regard. The measles virus was originally isolated in 1954 from the throat swab of a measles-infected patient (David Edmonston) and was attenuated by extensive tissue culture passage [25] . Most of the live attenuated measles vaccines in current use were derived from this Edmonston lineage, as were the oncolytic strains of measles virus that are currently under investigation. Because of the successful global deployment of the measles vaccine, most humans are immune to measles [26] . Hence, even if an oncolytic measles virus were to evolve new pathogenic potential, transmission from patient to (measles-immune) carer would be highly unlikely. The scenario of an oncolytic measles virus evolving to become a pathogen is highly unlikely because reversion to pathogenicity of the closely related Edmonston-derived measles vaccine has not been documented in more than a billion vaccinees, the vaccine strain is not shed in saliva or urine, and person-to-person vaccine transmission has not been convincingly documented [27] . Finally, in contrast to other viruses such as influenza, measles is monotypic and has an extremely slow rate of evolution. This explains how anti-measles immunity acquired by vaccination with the Edmonston vaccine strain, originally isolated in 1954 [25] , is still strongly protective against all currently circulating measles strains, more than 50 years later.

For efficacy, oncolytic viruses must be capable of penetrating host defenses to access growing tumors, whether primary or metastatic. They must also be capable of propagating sufficiently at the target site to destroy infected tumors before the infection is controlled and eliminated by the immune system.

Cancer patients have many antiviral defense mechanisms that all need to be penetrated or overcome for the oncolytic virus to be effective. For example, viruses in the bloodstream can be neutralized by antibodies and complement, bound by receptor-positive non-target cells or cleared by phagocytes in the liver and the spleen [3] . Intravenously administered viruses are, therefore, eliminated rapidly from the circulation, and this process becomes faster after each subsequent exposure because of increasing antiviral immunity. So formidable are the barriers to efficient and accurate vascular delivery of viruses that skepticism has been expressed as to whether these agents will ever be exploitable as systemic therapies. However, against this uninformed negativity, the virotherapy research community is developing a broad range of viable solutions to the intravascular (intravenous or intra-arterial) delivery problem.

One approach is to administer a different viral serotype at each successive treatment cycle. For many viruses (e.g. adenovirus and VSV), there are several naturally occurring serotypes that, by definition, are resistant to neutralization by antisera against the other serotypes [28, 29] . For certain viruses, it is also possible to modify the viruses by engineering or evolving them so that they are no longer neutralized by antibodies raised against the original virus [30] . The serotype-switching approach is not applicable to monotypic viruses such as measles.

Polymer coating of viruses is another way to block antibody recognition [31] . 90% of primary amino groups on the surface of adenovirus particles became modified by the polymer when adenoviruses were mixed with poly [N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (pHPMA) bearing reactive 4-nitrophenyl (ONp) esters on pendent diglycyl side-chains. The polymer-coated viruses have extended circulation times in vivo but this prevents the virus from binding to its cellular receptors. Infectivity can be restored, at least partially, by incorporating cell-targeting ligands into the polymer coating [32] .

An alternative to virus modification is to reduce the concentration of circulating antiviral antibodies in the patient before infusing the virus [33] . This might be achieved by infusion of soluble viral antigens, passing blood through antigen-loaded columns or immunizing with antiviral antibodies to provoke an anti-idiotypic antibody response that sequesters antiviral antibodies and prevents them from interacting with infused viral particles Another approach to reducing the concentration of antiviral antibodies is through the destruction of virusspecific B lymphocytes or antibody-producing plasma cells with steroids, cyclophosphamide or anti-B-cell antibodies [34] . However, reductions in the concentration of neutralizing antibodies after terminating their production are very slow because the serum half-life of antiviral IgG is longer than 20 days [35, 36] . Plasmapheresis is routinely used in the clinic for depletion of IgM antibodies or immune complexes but the approach, although straightforward, is relatively ineffective for depleting circulating IgG.

As an alternative to changing the virus coat or to suppressing antibody responses, recent data indicate that it could be possible to 'hide' a virus so that it cannot be seen or bound by antiviral antibodies as it transits the blood-stream to gain access to the tumor cell population [37] . This can be achieved either by using virus-infected cells as carriers to transport the virus to its target cell population [33, [38] [39] [40] or by delivering the virus genome to target cells as non-immunogenic infectious nucleic acid [41] . Both of these approaches have the potential to circumvent phagocytic clearance mechanisms that sequester viruses in the liver and the spleen, but they must be used in conjunction with effective targeting strategies to minimize the transduction of non-target tissues.

The extravasation of intravenously administered viruses into the parenchyma of a tumor is another important variable, which is influenced by both the size of the viral particles (smaller nanoparticles extravasate better) [42] and the permeability of the tumor blood vessels. In mouse xenograft models, and perhaps in some primary and metastatic human cancers, the permeability of blood vessels is greater at the tumor periphery, and oncolytic viruses extravasate more efficiently at that location [43] [44] [45] . Vascular permeability can be increased by local expression of vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor or by local inflammation secondary to treatment with external beam radiation or chemotherapy [46] . An alternative strategy for enhancing viral extravasation from tumor blood vessels is to engineer their attachment proteins to bind to receptors expressed on tumor blood vessel endothelium [47, 48] . Viruses with dual specificity for neovessel endothelium and antigens expressed on tumor cells are required to ensure that intratumoral propagation can proceed after the virus has been transported across the endothelial lining of the tumor blood vessels.

Depending on the virus, the time from infection to target-cell death can range from a few hours to a few days, and the number of progeny released from a single infected cell (burst size) can range from1 to 100 000. Thus, in the absence of an immune system, oncolytic viruses spread through tumors at widely differing speeds [49] . In the presence of an immune system, antiviral immunity is the major host factor that serves to modulate the speed of intratumoral virus propagation [50] .Most important in this regard is the cellular arm of the immune system, which controls the spread of infection by destroying infected cells before they have a chance to release their viral progeny.

Antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses can be suppressed by immunosuppressive drugs, thereby promoting the intratumoral spread of an oncolytic virus. Cyclophosphamide is an attractive immunosuppressive drug to use in combination with oncolytic virotherapy because rapidly dividing lymphocytes are exquisitely sensitive to its cytotoxic actions and it has proven activity as an effective anti-neoplastic agent used extensively in the treatment of human malignancy [51] . Cyclophosphamide is well tolerated, available at low cost and strongly inhibits antiviral immune responses, whether primary or anamnestic, B cell or T cell, when administered at the appropriate time and dose following virus exposure [52] [53] [54] [55] . Thus, cyclophosphamide can greatly increase the efficiency of virus spread from infected tumor cells to adjacent uninfected cells [56] and can help to limit increases in the antiviral antibody titer between successive viral doses.

Pharmacokinetics describes the fate of a drug in the body, including its absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion, and has not been adequately addressed in previous human virotherapy studies. Key pharmacokinetic questions, usually left unanswered in Phase I virotherapy trials, are: (i) where do the virus particles go and how many reach the target site? (ii) How many target cells get infected, where are they located and what is their identity? (iii) Is the viral genome expressed in the infected cells and, if so, at what level and for how long? (iv) How many progeny viruses are released by infected cells, when are they released and where do they go? (v) How fast and how far does the virus spread and when is it eliminated from the body? Answers to these important questions are routinely obtained in preclinical studies by direct analysis of tissue samples harvested from multiple sites at multiple time-points but such analyses are not feasible in human trials. To study the pharmacokinetics of oncolytic viruses in a clinical setting, we need convenient, noninvasive monitoring strategies that can be used to quantify the expression level of virusencoded proteins and to map the distribution of virus-infected cells. Repeat testing should be undertaken in each treated patient to track the spread of the virus and to determine the time course of viral gene expression. Marker genes can be incorporated into the viral genome to facilitate this type of clinical monitoring.

Oncolytic measles viruses coding for the soluble extracellular domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen (MV-CEA) were recently generated to facilitate the noninvasive monitoring of virus propagation in human subjects through serial measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations [57, 58] . A second recombinant oncolytic measles virus (MV-NIS) -coding for the human thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS), a membrane ion channel responsible for transporting iodine into thyroid follicular cells -was then generated [59] . MV-NIS-infected cells concentrate radioactive iodine from the bloodstream, enabling the status of an infection to be monitored by serial noninvasive single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging using 123 I or 124 I as tracers. These two recombinant measles viruses are currently being tested in Phase I dose-escalation clinical trials in patients with ovarian cancer (MV-CEA), glioma (MV-CEA) or multiple myeloma (MV-NIS) [59] [60] [61] [62] .

Transgenes encoding certain intracellular enzymes or non-signaling cell-surface receptors can also facilitate imaging. Thus, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase enzyme can phosphorylate and trap a radioactive 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-1-β-D-β-arabinofuranosyl-5iodouracil (FIAU) tracer in virus-infected cells, so viruses expressing this transgene can be imaged by PET or SPECT [63] [64] [65] . Also, a mutated dopamine D 2 receptor through which dopamine is unable to signal can trap a PET-labeled ligand tracer at sites of virus propagation [65, 66] . These new monitoring strategies are expected to enhance the quality of the pharmacological information gained from early-stage clinical virotherapy trials and this will provide a rational basis for intelligent protocol modifications that will hasten the inevitability of clinical success.

After a long incubation period, oncolytic viruses are finally emerging as potentially useful anticancer drugs. Data currently emerging from ongoing Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are extremely encouraging, showing that tumor regressions can occur even after systemic virus delivery [67] . However, significant challenges remain. In particular, the clinical potency of oncolytic viruses must be increased if they are to become a truly effective cancer therapy, and it seems likely that their clinical potential will be fully realized only when they can be safely administered to patients receiving concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. To ensure their safe deployment in the setting of antibody depletion and transient immunosuppression, it is anticipated that future oncolytic viruses will have to be not only more potent but also more tumor specific than those currently tested, and amenable to noninvasive pharmacological monitoring. Mechanisms of tumor targeting by oncolytic viruses. (a) Transcriptional targeting. An essential viral gene is placed under the control of a tumor-specific promoter (some virus promoters are naturally tumor specific). Typically, the selected gene encodes an early viral protein that is essential for successful completion of the virus life cycle. This is applicable only to DNA viruses (excluding poxviruses) and retroviruses. (b) Translational targeting. The virus is engineered (or adapted) to disable viral proteins that antagonize the cellular interferon (IFN) response. Normal cells then release interferon upon infection, causing neighboring cells to shut-off translation. Infected cancer cells are impaired in their ability to release or respond normally to interferon. (c) Pro-apoptotic targeting. The virus is engineered (or adapted) to disable viral proteins that prevent apoptosis. Normal cells then die quickly upon infection before progeny viruses can be produced. Infected cancer cells are impaired in their ability to undergo apoptosis. Hence, the virus can generate progeny and spread only in the cancer cells. (d) Transductional targeting. The virus gains entry to its target cells through a receptor expressed more abundantly on tumor cells than on normal cells. The natural receptors for several viruses fall into this category. Alternatively, the attachment specificity of the virus can be reprogrammed towards tumor antigens by the display of single-chain antibodies or other polypeptide-binding ligands on the viral surface.

viruses Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies as Promising Therapeutics against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection,"Since emerging in 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a global public health threat with a high fatality rate and worldwide distribution. There are no approved vaccines or therapies for MERS until now. Passive immunotherapy with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic reagent against emerging viruses. In this article, we review current advances in neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of MERS-CoV is a major target, and mouse, camel, or human-derived neutralizing mAbs targeting RBD have been developed. A major problem with neutralizing mAb therapy is mutant escape under selective pressure, which can be solved by combination of neutralizing mAbs targeting different epitopes. Neutralizing mAbs are currently under preclinical evaluation, and they are promising candidate therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the death of a man with pneumonia; the causative agent was subsequently identified as MERS-CoV, which belonged to lineage C betacoronaviruses [1] . With dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius, also known as Arabian camel) as direct sources and bats as potential reservoirs [2] , MERS-CoV has been frequently introduced into human populations. Once MERS-CoV is introduced into a person, person-to-person transmission might occur, and is responsible for approximately 40% of MERS cases globally [3] . MERS-CoV has been a consistent threat to humans. As of October 2018, MERS-CoV has caused 2254 laboratory-confirmed human cases, including 800 deaths in 27 countries, with the fatality rate as high as 35% (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Although MERS cases are primarily reported in the Middle East, facilitated by international travelling, MERS-CoV can also be a worldwide threat, which is well illustrated by the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [4] . Given the potential risk of causing worldwide public health emergencies and the absence of licensed vaccines and antiviral therapeutics, the World Health Organization has listed MERS-CoV in the ""List of Blueprint priority diseases"" (http://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/).

Vaccines are the most important approach against viral infections, but usually take a long time to develop. They are also unable to provide either immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing viral infections. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool to provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging viruses [5] . Potent neutralizing mAbs can be achieved by various technologies, such as hybridoma technology, humanized mouse, phage or yeast display, and single B cell isolation [5] .

MERS-CoV is a single, positive-stranded RNA virus of about 30 kb, which encodes four major viral structural proteins-including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)-as well as several accessory proteins [6] . The S protein (1353 aa) plays an important role in virus infection and consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 (aa 18-751) and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 (aa 752-1353). S1 mediates viral attachment to host cells and S2 mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [7] . The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 367-606) [8] that can bind to cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), and mediates viral attachment target cells [9] . The RBD consists of a core subdomain and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) (aa 484-567). The schematic representation of MERS-CoV S protein is shown in Figure 1A . Neutralizing mAbs binding to the S protein of MERS-CoV can prevent viral attachment to the cell receptor and inhibit viral entry [7] . The S protein of MERS-CoV is a key target for antivirals, and RBD is the most popular focus. In this study, we review the current knowledge on neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of MERS-CoV.

Stable hybridoma cell lines were generated by fusing myeloma cells with splenocytes of mice that were immunized with MERS-RBD protein. Two neutralizing mAbs, 4C2 and 2E6, had high affinity for the RBD of MERS-CoV and blocked both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV entry into cells with high efficacy [10] . Humanized 4C2 showed similar neutralizing activity in cell entry tests. In vivo tests indicated that 4C2 could significantly reduce the virus titers in the lungs of Ad5-hCD26-transduced mice which were infected with MERS-CoV, highlighting its potential application in humans not only for preventing but also treating MERS-CoV infection. Crystallization of the 4C2 Fab/MERS-RBD complex showed that the 4C2 recognized conformational epitopes (Y397-N398, K400, L495-K496, P525, V527-S532, W535-E536, and D539-Q544), which were partially overlapped the receptor-binding footprint in the RBD of MERS-CoV. The 4C2 complex interfered with MERS-CoV binding to DPP4 by both steric hindrance and interface-residue competition. 2E6 competed with 4C2 to bind to MERS-RBD, indicating that they recognized proximate or overlapping epitopes [10] .

Neutralizing mAb Mersmab1 was obtained by fusing myeloma cells with splenocytes of a mouse that was immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S1 [11] . Mersmab1 effectively blocked the entry of pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV into cells. Structural analysis showed that Mersmab1 bound to the RBD of MERS-CoV through recognizing conformational epitopes, and all of the residues critical for Mersmab1 binding were located on the left ridge of RBM. Mersmab1 neutralized MERS-CoV by competitively blocking the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to DPP4. Based on escape mutant analysis of the key residues on the RBD, it was found that residue L506, D510, R511, E513, and W553 were critical for Mersmab1 binding to the RBD, while mutation of E536, D539, or E565 did not affect the interaction of Mersmab1 and the RBD at all [11] .

An ultra-large nonimmune human antibody-phage display library was constructed with B cells of unimmunized donors. With a unique spanning strategy, seven human neutralizing mAbs with varying neutralization efficacy to MERS-CoV were identified [12] . Binding detection demonstrated that the epitopes of these mAbs lay within aa 349-590 of the S protein, which overlapped a large part of the RBD of MERS-CoV. Binding competition assays showed that these mAbs recognized at least three distinct epitope groups, which was further confirmed by escape studies. With no cross-epitope resistance, these mAbs neutralized MERS-CoV by competitively blocking the binding of the RBD of MERS-CoV to DPP4. Escape mutant assays showed that five residues were critical for neutralization of these mAbs, namely L506, T512, Y540, R542, and P547. Of the seven mAbs, 3B11 exhibited the best neutralization activity against both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV infectivity in cells. Moreover, under the selective pressure of these mAbs, the IgG form of 3B11 was superior, since it did not induce neutralization escape [12] . In vivo tests demonstrated that 3B11 reduced lung pathology in rhesus monkeys infected with MERS-CoV [13] . With its high neutralizing activity and suppression of mutant escape, 3B11 in the IgG form is a promising therapeutic mAb against MERS-CoV.

Three human mAbs-m336, m337, and m338-were identified from a large naïve human phage display antibody library, which was constructed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers [14] . The binding sties of the three mAbs were within the RBD of MERS-CoV (aa 377-588), therefore they neutralized MERS-CoV by competing with DPP4 binding to the RBD. The three mAbs also competed with each other to bind to the RBD of MERS-CoV, and mutant analysis showed that the three mAbs possessed overlapping but distinct epitopes. Of the three mAbs, m336 neutralized both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV infectivity in cells with exceptional potency (m336 inhibited 90% MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 0.039 g/mL, and neutralized live MERS-CoV with IC 95 of 1 g/mL and IC 50 of 0.07 g/mL). Residues in the RBD crucial for m336 binding were L506, D510, E536, D539, W553, and V555 [14] . In vivo study demonstrated that prophylaxis with m336 reduced virus titers in the lung of rabbits infected with MERS-CoV [15] , and m336 also provided transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 with full prophylactic and therapeutic protection from MERS-CoV [16] . However, another study with a non-human primate, the common marmoset showed that m336 could only alleviate the severity of the disease, and did not provide complete protection against MERS-CoV [17] .

IgG+ memory B cells were isolated from a MERS patient, and were subsequently immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus. A neutralizing mAbs, LCA60, was identified, and was the first fully human neutralizing mAb with naïve heavy and light chain pairs [18] . LCA60 efficiently neutralize MERS-CoV infectivity in cells. In vivo study showed that LCA60 provided BALB/c mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4) with both prophylactic and postexposure protection against MERS-CoV. Furthermore, the neutralizing efficacy of LCA60 was evaluated in IFN-α/β receptor-knockout mice that were more stringent models of MERS-CoV infection. After transducing with hDPP4, these mice showed more profound clinical symptoms when challenged with MERS-CoV [19] ; administration of LCA60 reduced MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of these mice more effectively (lung viral titer reduced by three logs in one day for IFN-α/β receptor-knockout mice vs. three days for BALB/c mice) [18] . With naïve heavy and light chain pairs, LCA60 was more potent than 3B11 and comparable to m336. Cross-competition experiment demonstrated that LCA60 competed with 3B11 to bind to the RBD. LCA60 interacted with RBD residues around K493, and the LCA60 footprint on the RBD was partially overlapped with that of DPP4. Four residues in the RBD affected the binding of LCA60-namely T489, K493, E536, and E565-which were conserved in all MERS-CoV isolates. Moreover, compared with DPP4, the binding affinity of LCA60 to RBD was significantly higher (~500-fold). Therefore, one major neutralization mechanism of LCA60 was to competitively inhibit the interaction of the RBD with DPP4. Interestingly, virus escape studies demonstrated that under the selective pressure of LCA60, a mutant variant (V33A) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MERS-CoV S1 subunit was also generated [18] . A GMP-approved cell line (LCA60.273.1) that expresses LCA60 in high concentrations has been established, highlighting its application as promising therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection [20] .

Hybridoma B cells producing neutralizing mAbs against the S protein of MERS-CoV were generated by immunizing humanized transgenic mice (VelocImmune mice) with DNA encoding the MERS-CoV S protein. Two fully human neutralizing mAbs, REGN3051 and REGN3048, were obtained [21] . The two mAbs bound with high affinity to distinct epitopes on the RBD of MERS-CoV, which were conserved during the natural evolution of MERS-CoV. Mutation as a result of selective pressure by one mAb should not affect the binding of the other mAb. REGN3051 neutralized a broad range of MERS-CoV isolates, the prototype EMC/2012 strain and all clinical mutants including A431P, S457G, S460F, A482V, L506F, D509G, and V534A. With the exception of V534A variant, REGN3048 achieved similar neutralizing activity. In vivo study demonstrated that REGN3051 and REGN3048 reduced MERS-CoV replication in humanized DPP4 mice in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings [21] . When evaluated in the common marmoset, both mAbs seemed to be more effective for prophylaxis rather than for treatment of MERS-CoV infection [22] .

An anti-MERS-CoV phage display antibody library was constructed with the peripheral B cells of a MERS survivor, and a human neutralizing mAb against MERS-CoV, MCA1, was identified [23] . MCA1 showed potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in cell entry tests. In vivo, MCA1 completely inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in common marmosets when administrated prophylactically or therapeutically. Structure analysis of the MCA1 Fab-RBD complex showed that MCA1 formed direct contacts with the receptor-binding site (RBS) subdomain on the RBD. Epitopes on the RBS critical for MCA1 binding were D510, W535, E536, D539, Y540, R542, and Q544. Superimposed structure analysis of MCA1-RBD and hDPP4-RBD complexes showed that the binding interface of MCA1 was largely overlapped with that of hDPP4. Therefore, the neutralizing mechanism of MCA1 was achieved by competing with DPP4 for binding to the RBD [23] .

Two potent human neutralizing mAbs, MERS-4 and MERS-27, were derived from a nonimmune human yeast display antibody library, which was constructed with spleen and lymph node polyadenylated RNA from normal humans [24] . [24] . Further structural analysis showed that MERS-4 bound to unique epitopes and caused conformational changes in the RBD interface critical for accommodating DPP4, therefore indirectly disrupting the interaction between the two. Moreover, MERS-4 also demonstrated synergistic effects with m336 and 5F9 (a NTD-specific mAb). The special neutralizing mechanism made MERS-4 a valuable addition for the combined use of mAbs against MERS-CoV infection [25] .

Thirteen ultrapotent neutralizing mAbs, which all targeted the RBD of MERS-CoV were generated following a protocol for the rapid production of antigen-specific human mAbs [26] . Briefly, antibody-secreting B cells were isolated from the whole blood of a MERS patient, and the antibody genes were amplified and cloned into vectors to transfect human cell lines for mAb production. Of the 13 mAbs, MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 exhibited the strongest neutralizing activity against both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV in cell infection tests. MERS-GD27 directly competed with DPP4 to bind to the RBD to DPP4, and the crystal structure of MERS-GD27 showed that its epitopes were almost completely overlapped with DPP4-binding sites. MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct epitopes on the RBD, and had a low level of competing activity. The combined use of the two mAbs demonstrated synergistic effects in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Mutant analysis demonstrated that residues L506, D509, V534, E536, and A556 on RBD were important for the neutralizing activity of MERS-GD27, and residue R511was critical for MERS-GD33 [26] . Moreover, In vivo study found that MERS-GD27 could provide both prophylactic and therapeutic protection for hDPP4-trangenic mice against MERS-CoV infection [27] .

Dromedary camels exposed to MERS-CoV showed mild clinical signs but developed exceptionally potent neutralizing antibodies. Camelid species naturally produced heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) [28] , which are dimeric and devoid of light chains, and their antigen recognition region is solely formed by the variable heavy chains (VHHs) (also called nanobodies, Nbs). VHHs or Nbs have long complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loops and are capable of binding to unique epitopes not accessible to conventional antibodies [29] . Notably, camelid VHHs are relatively stable and can be produced with high yields in prokaryotic systems [30] . Because of their small size; good tissue permeability; and cost-effective production, storage, and transportation [31] [32] [33] , VHHs or Nbs have been gaining acceptance as antiviral agents.

A VHH complementary DNA library was constructed with the bone marrow of dromedary camels infected with MERS-CoV. Four VHHs (VHH-1, VHH-4, VHH-83, and VHH-101) with high neutralizing activity were identified by direct cloning and screening of the phage display antibody library [34] . The four VHHs competed for a single epitope that partially overlapped with the RBD-DPP4 interface. Mutant analysis showed that the four VHHs did not bind to the D539N variant, which was a critical residue on the RBD for DPP4 binding [8, 35] . Therefore, these VHHs most likely neutralized MERS-CoV by blocking its binding to DPP4. Of the 4 VHHs, VHH-83 showed the best neutralizing activity and epitope recognition. VHH-83 efficiently blocked the entry of MERS-CoV into cells, and it also prophylactically protected K18 transgenic mouse expressing hDPP4 from MERS-CoV infection. To extend the half-life of VHH-83 in serum, it was linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exon to construct the chimeric camel/human HCAb-83, which showed similar neutralizing activity as VHH-83. The chimeric camel/human HCAb-83 was highly stable in mice and provided K18 mice with fully prophylactic protection against MERS-CoV infection [34] .

Alpacas were immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV RBD-containing a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag, and VHHs were amplified from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells to construct a VHH phage display library. A neutralizing Nb, NbMS10, which bound with high affinity to the RBD of MERS-CoV and blocked the binding of RBD to DPP4, was identified [36] . To extend its in vivo half-life, the human-Fc-fused version, NbMS10-Fc, was constructed. NbMS10 competed with DPP4 to bind to RBD, indicating that the binding site of NbMS10 on RBD overlapped with that of DPP4. The binding site of the NbMS10 on the RBD was mapped to be around residue D539, which is part of a highly conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface in almost all the natural MERS-CoV published to date. NbMS10 did not neutralize psuedotyped MERS-CoV bearing a mutation in D539, confirming that residue D539 was critical for NbMS10 binding. NbMS10 efficiently neutralized the cell entry of live MERS-CoV. Moreover, NbMS10 showed potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in protecting hDPP4-transgenic mice against MERS-CoV infection [36] .

For their exceptionally high neutralization activity in vitro and in vivo, these newly identified neutralizing mAbs are promising candidate therapeutics against the infection of MERS-CoV. However, the use of a single neutralizing antibody bears the risk of selecting escape mutants, a fact that has been observed for LCA60 and other described antibodies [12, 18, 37] . Notably, the majority of these escape mutations had little impact on viral fitness and the interaction of DPP4 with the RBD [12] . Moreover, mutants of MERS-CoV during natural infection have also been reported [38] . Escape from neutralization is a major concern with therapeutic neutralizing mAbs, however, this potential problem can be solved by combining mAbs that target distinct epitopes and show different neutralizing mechanisms [37] . This strategy can take advantage of the synergistic effects while decreasing the possibility of viral escape.

Currently, most of the MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs compete with DPP4 binding to the RBD, and residues on the RBD critical for mAb neutralization are identified by mutant analysis. Almost all of the residues identified critical for mAb neutralization are located in RBM, and overlap with those critical for DPP4 binding ( Figure 1B) . With the availability of crystal structure of mAb Fab-RBD complex, the neutralization mechanism of these mAbs will be better illustrated.

Based on the crystal structure of RBD-DPP4, it was found that several conserved residues in the RBD are critical for the interaction of the RBD with DPP4 (Y499, L506, D510, E513, E536, D537, D539, Y540, R542, W553, and V555) [35, 39] . Development of therapeutic neutralizing mAbs targeting those critically conserved residues might be important for combating MERS-CoV. Moreover, a study found a mouse-derived neutralizing mAb, 5F9, which bound to a possible linear epitope in the NTD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, exhibited efficient neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV in cell entry tests. This study highlighted the important role of NTD during the infection process of MERS-CoV. NTD might have significant implications for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic mAbs against MERS-CoV infection [40] . Although the in vitro neutralizing potency of 5F9 was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs [40] , it may provide an alternative for the immunotherapy against MERS-CoV, once the virus mutates and is no longer susceptible to RBD-specific mAbs.

So far, there is a lack of appropriate animal models to mimic the pathology of MERD-CoV in humans. Commonly-used laboratory animals-such as wild-type mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig-are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection due to differences in critical amino acids in the S-binding domain of their DPP4 [41] [42] [43] . New Zealand rabbits, hDPP4-transduced/transgenic mice, camelids and non-human primates (rhesus macaque and common marmoset) are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, however, rabbits showed asymptomatic infection [44] ; dromedary camels displayed different clinical manifestations to that of humans [45] ; rhesus macaque only showed transient lower respiratory infection [46] , while common marmoset developed progressive pneumonia [47] ; hDPP4-trangenic mouse expressed hDPP4 extensively, and resulted in multiple organ damage [48] ; hDPP4-transduced mouse only exhibited mild transient clinical diseases [19] . With robust animal models, the protective effects of these neutralizing mAbs will be better evaluated. Furthermore, ongoing efforts on developing therapeutic neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV should also consider the different target populations (dromedary camels and humans) and their protective efficacy.

Inhibition of SARS Coronavirus Infection In Vitro with Clinically Approved Antiviral Drugs,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Currently, no effective drug exists to treat SARS-CoV infection. In this study, we investigated whether a panel of commercially available antiviral drugs exhibit in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activity. A drugscreening assay that scores for virus-induced cytopathic effects on cultured cells was used. Tested were 19 clinically approved compounds from several major antiviral pharmacologic classes: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. Complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon subtypes, β-1b, α-n1, α-n3, and human leukocyte interferon a. These findings support clinical testing of approved interferons for the treatment of SARS.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1, 2) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4) . The disease can produce severe pneumonia with a reported fatal outcome of 15% to 20%. Currently, no effective drug exists to treat SARS-CoV infection (5) . The urgency of the outbreak has led to the empiric use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral agents in affected patients in several countries (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Intensive efforts are under way to gain more insight into the mechanisms of viral replication, in order to develop targeted antiviral therapies and vaccines. Developing effective and safe vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents against SARS CoV, however, may take years.

The recent epidemic has shown that knowledge is lacking regarding the clinical management and treatment of infected patients. Ribavirin (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , oseltamivir (8) (9) (10) , foscarnet (8) , intravenous immunoglobulin (8) , and other agents have been used to treat patients. Preliminary results from in vitro testing indicate that ribavirin concentrations that inhibit other viruses sensitive to ribavirin do not inhibit replication or cell-to-cell spread of the SARS-CoV (5) . However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that further in vitro testing of antiviral drugs on other coronavirus isolates and more information on the clinical outcome of patients treated with ribavirin or other antiviral drugs in controlled trials is needed (5) .

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a panel of currently available antiviral agents exhibit in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activity. Three general antiviral strategies are generally found (13) : 1) direct antiviral effects, 2) inhibition of viral entry and replication at the cellular level by targeting virus-related processes, and 3) enhancement of host immune response. A total of 19 drugs approved for clinical use in the treatment of viral infections were tested in this study. They are representative compounds from major antiviral pharmacologic classes that are currently commercially available: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors.

A cell-based assay utilizing cytopathic endpoints (CPE) was set up using Vero E6 cells to screen these antiviral compounds. SARS-CoV has been shown to infect Vero E6 cells, an African green monkey kidney cell line (3) , and this remains the only in vitro model of SARS-CoV infection. The initial screen was followed by a plaque reduction assay to determine the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of compounds showing positive results. These experiments allow rapid screening of commercially available antiviral agents, enabling those with in vitro evidence of activity to move expeditiously into clinical studies, since safety and pharmacokinetic information in humans is already available for other disease indications.

Here we report that certain interferon subtypes exhibit in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and are candidates for follow-up studies in animal models and patients to determine their efficacy in vivo.

To rapidly identify a pharmacologic agent that could be used to treat SARS, a collection of antiviral drugs was tested against SARS-CoV, the etiologic agent of the atypical pneumonia. To investigate a wide spectrum of potential molecular targets, we decided to cover the entire pharmacologic range of commercially available antiviral agents, including agents not expected to be active against coronaviruses. Information on antiviral drugs provided here was obtained from prescribing information sheets or from communications with the manufacturer.

Nucleoside analogues are a diverse class of compounds; in general, they inhibit viral RNA or DNA polymerases or other enzymes, interfering with nucleic acid synthesis. In this study, the selected compounds that target DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster viruses (VZV) were acyclovir, ganciclovir, and foscarnet. Ribavirin has activity against a range of DNA and RNA viruses; in different cell lines, ED 50 ranges from 1 to 100 µg/mL. Antiretroviral (HIV) drugs include reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Selected HIV nucleoside RT inhibitors studied were zidovudine and lamivudine, while HIV protease inhibitors studied were indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir. The third group of antivirals studied were the neuraminidase inhibitors, both commercially available preparations, zanamivir and oseltamivir were used in this study. Interferons were the next major class of antivirals studied. Various subtypes of interferon α (2a, 2b, n1, and n3, human leukocyte) and β (1a and 1b) were used. Amantadine, an old antiviral compound, was also studied. Different terms have been used to express antiviral activity, namely, EC 50 , 95% effective concentration (EC 95 ), and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ); Table 1 illustrates the range of activity against selected viruses.

Tenfold dilutions of the drug were tested to cover a broad range of concentrations above and below inhibitory dosages as reported by the manufacturer for other viralhost combinations. Compounds already present in aqueous injections were made up to volume by using Hank's buffered saline solution. For tablet and capsule formulations with soluble active ingredients, the outer coat was removed wherever applicable, and the preparation was ground in a mortar and pestle. The contents were dissolved in water, vortexed, and centrifuged thereafter at 3,000 g. The required volume was pipetted from the supernatant and diluted accordingly. When the active ingredients were insoluble in water (nelfinavir and saquinavir), the contents were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO); care was taken to ensure that the final concentration of DMSO in the dilutions would not exceed 1%. For plaque assays, fivefold drug dilutions were prepared by using growth media as specified below.

Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated in 75 cm 2 cell culture flasks in growth medium consisting of medium 199 (Sigma, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). SARS-CoV 2003VA2774 (an isolate from a SARS patient in Singapore), which has been previously sequenced (14) , was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 2 mL of stock virus was added to a confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 1 h; 13 mL of medium 199 supplemented with 5% FCS was then added. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , and the supernatant was harvested after 48 h; in >75% of cultures, inhibition of CPE (3+) in each well was observed with an inverted microscope. The supernatant was clarified at 2,500 rpm and then divided into aliquots, placed in cryovials, and stored at -80°C until use.

All virus culture and assays were carried out in the biosafety level-3 laboratory at the Environmental Health Institute, according to the conditions set out in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (15) . Virus titer in the frozen culture supernatant was determined by using a plaque assay. Briefly, 100 µL of virus in 10-fold serial dilution was added, in duplicates, to a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 24-well plate. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , the viral inoculum was aspirated, and 1 mL of carboxymethylcellulose overlay with medium 199, supplemented with 5% FCS, was added to each well. After 4 days of incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 2% crystal violet. The plaques were counted visually, and the virus titer in plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL) was calculated.

The protocol used was adapted from Al-Jabri et al. (16) , and all drugs were tested in quadruplicate. Briefly, 100 µL of serial 10-fold dilutions of the drugs were incubated with 100 µL of Vero E6 cells, giving a final cell count of 20,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. The incubation period was 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , except for the interferons, which were incubated overnight with the cells. Ten microlites of virus at a concentration of 10,000 PFU/well was then added to each of the test wells. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 3 days and observed daily for CPE. The end point was the drug dilution that inhibited 100% of the CPE (CIA 100 ) in quadruplicate wells. To determine cytotoxicity, 100 µL of serial 10-fold dilutions of the drugs was incubated with 100 µL of Vero E6 cells, giving a final cell count of 20,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate, without viral challenge. The plates were then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 3 days and examined for toxicity effects by using an inverted microscope.

Trypsinized Vero E6 cells were resuspended in growth medium and preincubated with interferons (serial fivefold dilution) in quadruplicate wells in 24-well plates. The next day, the medium was aspirated, and 100 µL of virus was added to each well at a titer of 100 PFU/well. After incubation for 1 h, the virus inoculum was aspirated, and a carboxymethylcellulose overlay containing maintenance medium and the appropriate interferon concentration was added. After 4 days' incubation, the plates were fixed and stained as described previously. The number of plaques was then counted visually, and the concentration of drug that inhibits 50% of plaques in each well (IC 50 ) was deter-mined. Results were plotted in Microsoft Excel, and a polynomial of order three was used to approximate the data and extrapolate IC 50 and IC 95 values.

High titers of infectious SARS-CoV, originally derived from a respiratory sample of a SARS patient, were propagated on Vero E6 cells. The CPE of SARS-CoV on Vero E6 was evident within 24 hours after infection (Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-infected cells display a CPE characterized by the appearance of rounded cells and the destruction of the monolayer.

A collection of 19 antiviral drugs was tested in the SARS-CoV CPE inhibition assay ( Table 2) . The set of drugs tested included seven interferons, five nucleoside analogs, three protease inhibitors, two RT inhibitors, and two neuraminidase inhibitors. Complete inhibition of the CPE was observed for four of the seven interferons in the initial screen when very high viral challenge of 10 4 PFU/well and a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.5) rate were used. Complete inhibition, expressed as CIA 100 , was observed for interferon β-1b (Betaferon) at 5,000 IU/mL, interferon α-n3 (Alferon) at 5,000 IU/mL, interferon α-n1 (Wellferon) at 250,000 IU/mL, and human leukocyte interferon α (Multiferon) at 500,000 IU/mL. Ribavirin also completely inhibited the CPE at 5,000 µg/mL ( Table 3) . None of the other drugs showed complete inhibition of CPE, even at the highest concentration of drug tested (Table 2) .

Rebif (IFN-β-1a) showed slight inhibition of CPE at 250,000 IU/mL, but the inhibition was not complete at the screening virus load of 10,000 PFU/well. Likewise, Roferon (IFN-α-2a) showed slight, incomplete inhibition at 50,000 IU/mL. Because the criteria for ascertaining anti-SARS-CoV activity in this screen were set at 100% inhibition of CPE, and as high doses of interferons may result in severe clinical side effects, we chose to conduct further evaluations only in the interferons that showed complete inhibition from initial screen, namely, Wellferon, Multiferon, Betaferon, and Alferon. Based upon results of the primary screen, the four active interferons and ribavirin were retested at two lower viral challenges, 10 3 and 10 2 PFU/ well. All four drugs again showed inhibitory effect, although the CIA 100 were dependent on viral loads (Table 3) . At the lowest viral load the CIA 100 were 5 IU/mL for both interferon β-1b (Betaferon) and human leukocyte interferon α (Multiferon); and 50 and 250 IU/mL for interferon α-n3 (Alferon) and interferon α-n1 (Wellferon), respectively. No cytotoxicity of the interferons was observed at or near inhibitory concentrations. Ribavirin showed inhibitory activity at all three viral loads, but only at high concentrations of the drug, 0.5-5 mg/mL. At high concentrations of ribavirin (0.2-1 mg/mL) cytotoxic effects were observed on VeroE6 cells, as has been reported for other cell types (17, 18) . As such, we consider ribavirin to be inactive against SARS-CoV.

A plaque reduction assay format with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV (MOI = 0.0005) was conducted to determine the IC 50 for Betaferon, Alferon, and Multiferon, the three compounds that showed greatest potency for inhibition of CPE. Additional supply was not available for testing interferon α-n1 (Wellferon), as production of this drug has been discontinued. Cells were preincubated for 15 h with fivefold dilutions of drug. Viral-induced plaques, which developed in 3 days, were counted to determine the inhibitory effect of the drugs at various concentrations. All three interferon preparations displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV plaque formation in this assay ( Figure 2 ). The IC 50 and IC 95 were determined to be 0.2 and 8 IU/mL for Betaferon, 0.8 and 200 IU/mL for Alferon, and 2 and 44 IU/mL for Multiferon.

Betaferon, Alferon, Multiferon, Wellferon, and ribavirin inhibited CPE in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, in decreasing order of potency. Ribavirin, a drug widely used in initial efforts to manage SARS infections, inhibited CPE completely at 500-5,000 µg/mL at virus loads of 100-10,000 PFU per well. The concentration range observed is much higher than concentrations that inhibit other viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, ED 50 2-8 µg/mL, HIV or resistant strains of rhinovirus, 50-100 µg/mL), including viruses that were tested on Vero cells (West Nile virus, New York isolate 178 µg/mL, and Uganda isolate 41 µg/mL) (19) . In addition, the CPE 10,000 500,000 10,000 10,000 1,000 10,000 5,000 1,000 1,000 100 1,000 500 10 100 (17, 18) . We observed slight cytotoxicity by microscopic examination of the cells, making it difficult to accurately obtain in vitro efficacy data against SARS-CoV. It appears that due to the low activity of ribavirin in vitro, inhibitory doses may not be achievable clinically. It is possible that ribavirin would be more effective in combination with interferons. Combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon α has now become standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C (20) (21) (22) . Additionally, we have tested the effect of ribavirin and Betaferon in combination (range of concentration of ribavirin, 1-100 µg/mL; range of concentration of Betaferon, 0.1-10 IU/mL). At 1,000 PFU, this combination did not demonstrate observable synergistic inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV. This study describes in vitro activity of four interferon subtypes against the SARS-CoV. Interferons have been used as anticancer and antiviral agents, in particular, for treating hepatitis B and C infections. Various groups have reported the clinical benefit of intranasally administered interferon α in human volunteers before and after inoculation with non-SARS coronaviruses (23) (24) (25) . The antiviral activity of interferons is mediated by direct effects on infected cells or by modulating an immune response (26) . Interferons interact with specific surface cell receptors, leading to production of interferon-stimulated gene products such as 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthase and protein kinase PKR (27) .

In SARS-CoV infection, a convenient starting point for the use of interferons against a SARS-CoV infection would be the usual clinical doses for the treatment of hepatitis B or C. Common clinical dosages for interferon α range from 3 to 5 million IU three times a week to 5 million IU daily. For interferon β, data regarding efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C are conflicting, and interferon β (at doses of 3 to 6 million IU three times weekly) is usually only used in the treatment of infections in patients whose condition no longer responds to other therapies. Plasma levels of interferons administered through the subcutaneous route are usually low with correspondingly short half-lives. In view of their mechanism of action, absolute serum levels may not be meaningful as a measure of the biologic activity of interferons, compared to the induction of cellular products such as 2′5′ oligoadenylate synthase.

Interferon activity varies among different cell types (28, 29) , however. Specific interferon subtypes which inhibit SARS-CoV in Vero cells may not necessarily have the same effect in other cells; the converse may also be true-that those drugs that are negative in Vero cells may be effective in other cell types. We are currently identifying other in vitro models of SARS-CoV infection that will enable us to address cell-type specific drug effects. Also, interferon subtypes exhibited different activity against SARS-CoV in this study. The mechanism for the difference in activity is unknown. Among the products tested, the source of interferon and amount of glycosylation differ. Some preparations were derived from human lymphoblastoid or leukocyte cells, while others were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cell culture. We do not know the importance of this observation with respect to possible antiviral mechanisms of the interferons against SARS-CoV or potential clinical implications of these differences.

This study describes rapid screening of commercially available compounds for extension into in vivo research. Evidence of activity and data from in vitro studies, however, cannot be easily correlated with clinical performance but rather present promising candidates for follow-up studies. Definite recommendations on anti-SARS-CoV activity of compounds in humans can only be made in the in vivo setting. In conclusion, interferon β-1b, α-n1, α-n3, and human leukocyte interferon α exhibit antiviral activity in an in

Chimpanzee-Human Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of Chronic Poliovirus Excretors and Emergency Postexposure Prophylaxis ᰔ ‡,"Six poliovirus-neutralizing Fabs were recovered from a combinatorial Fab phage display library constructed from bone marrow-derived lymphocytes of immunized chimpanzees. The chimeric chimpanzee-human fulllength IgGs (hereinafter called monoclonal antibodies [MAbs]) were generated by combining a chimpanzee IgG light chain and a variable domain of heavy chain with a human constant Fc region. The six MAbs neutralized vaccine strains and virulent strains of poliovirus. Five MAbs were serotype specific, while one MAb cross-neutralized serotypes 1 and 2. Epitope mapping performed by selecting and sequencing antibodyresistant viral variants indicated that the cross-neutralizing MAb bound between antigenic sites 1 and 2, thereby covering the canyon region containing the receptor-binding site. Another serotype 1-specific MAb recognized a region located between antigenic sites 2 and 3 that included parts of capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Both serotype 2-specific antibodies recognized antigenic site 1. No escape mutants to serotype 3-specific MAbs could be generated. The administration of a serotype 1-specific MAb to transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus at a dose of 5 g/mouse completely protected them from paralysis after challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type poliovirus. Moreover, MAb injection 6 or 12 h after virus infection provided significant protection. The MAbs described here could be tested in clinical trials to determine whether they might be useful for treatment of immunocompromised chronic virus excretors and for emergency protection of contacts of a paralytic poliomyelitis case.","Poliomyelitis is an infectious neurological disease that is caused by polioviruses of three distinct serological types. Two highly effective vaccines, one prepared from formalin-inactivated virulent virus and another from live attenuated strains administered orally, were developed in the 1950s (35, 36) . Their worldwide use resulted in almost complete eradication of the disease, with only a few countries remaining in which it is endemic and a few thousand paralytic cases annually. This dramatic success diminished interest in the development of new protective measures, as complete eradication of poliomyelitis was perceived to be very close. However, the original eradication target date of 2000 was missed by at least 10 years due to a variety of scientific, logistical, and political obstacles (13) . Therefore, in recent years, the setbacks in the global efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis, newly recognized challenges of the final phases of the WHO-coordinated campaign, and the need to prevent the reemergence of poliomyelitis in the posteradication period led to renewed efforts to develop more efficient vaccines, new strategies for their use, and other tools to protect against poliomyelitis (17, 27, 31) . They include licensure of more potent monovalent and bivalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV and bOPV, respectively), the development of a new generation of inactivated poliovirus vaccines for use in the posteradication period (8, 14) , and the development of drugs effective against poliovirus (10, 29) .

The use of OPV is associated with a small risk of vaccineassociated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in vaccine recipients and their immediate contacts (1) . It has also led to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) (21) and immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPVs) (25) . VDPVs of the first type cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis in inadequately immunized communities and are indistinguishable from wild polioviruses in their pathogenic properties. iVDPVs emerge in OPV-vaccinated individuals with primary B-cell immunodeficiencies and can establish chronic infection and be excreted into the environment for several years (20, 24) . Besides the immediate danger to the chronic carriers (some of the patients eventually become paralyzed by the continuously evolving poliovirus), the presence of chronic excretors poses a serious challenge to the polio eradication campaign, providing an ample source of virulent polioviruses in the environment, making it impossible to halt immunization against poliomyelitis (12) . Therefore, finding an effective treatment for these patients is an important public health objective. In 2006, the U.S. National Research Council recommended the development of at least two polio antiviral drugs to treat chronically infected individuals and to assist in the management of outbreaks in the posteradication period (10) .

Early work by Hammond at al. showed gamma globulin to be effective for the prevention of poliomyelitis (reviewed in reference 34). Therefore, passive immunotherapy could be another way to treat chronic excretors. Even though prior attempts to use intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and breast milk were unsuccessful (22) , there is reason to think that higher doses of antipoliovirus antibodies could result in complete clearance of poliovirus from chronically infected individuals. In this communication, we report the development of hybrid chimpanzee-human antipoliovirus immunoglobulins that could be used in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness for the treatment of chronic poliovirus excretors, as well as for postexposure emergency prophylaxis and disease prevention if there is a reemergence of poliomyelitis in the posteradication period.

Immunization of chimpanzees with poliovirus vaccines and construction of combinatorial Fab antibody library. Two chimpanzees (1603 and 1609) were immunized orally with all three serotypes of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) (GlaxoSmithKline) twice at a 2-month interval and were boosted intramuscularly with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (GlaxoSmithKline) 7 months and 2 years after the second immunization. Bone marrow was aspirated from each chimpanzee at days 10, 20, 30, and 40 after the last immunization. Bone marrow-derived lymphocytes were prepared by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque gradient and were used to construct a combinatorial Fab phage display library as described previously (4, 5) . A Fab phage display library containing ␥1 heavy chain and and light chain with a diversity of 10 8 was constructed. The chimpanzee protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the animals were housed in facilities accredited by AAALAC.

Panning of phage library and selection of poliovirus-specific Fabs. Phages were produced from the library as described previously (5) and panned by affinity binding separately on serotypes 1, 2, and 3 of Sabin strains of poliovirus in a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. For each cycle of panning, 100 l of OPV, which are the same viruses used for immunization, at 5 ϫ 10 6 PFU/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to coat each well of an ELISA plate, and specific phages were selected by incubating 10 12 phages with the coated virus. The poliovirus-specific Fab clones were enriched by three cycles of panning against the three serotypes. After panning, 96 single phage-Fab clones were cultured in a 96-well plate for phage production. The resulting phages were screened for specific binding to poliovirus by phage ELISA (5) . Clones that bound to the virus but not to bovine serum albumin (BSA) were scored as poliovirus-specific clones.

DNA sequence analysis of specific Fabs. The genes coding for the variable regions of the heavy (V H ) and light (V L ) chains of poliovirus-specific Fabs were sequenced. Fabs with distinct V H and V L sequences were regarded as separate Fab clones. The presumed immunoglobulin family usage, germ line origin, and somatic mutations were identified by comparison with those deposited in the IMGT sequence database (http://www.imgt.org).

Production of Fabs and IgGs. As described previously (5), histidine-tagged Fab was expressed in Escherichia coli and was affinity-purified on a nickel column. IgG was expressed in transiently transfected 293T mammalian cells and purified on a protein A column. Both Fab and IgG were further purified through a cation-exchange sulfopropyl (SP) column (GE Healthcare). The purities of the Fab and IgG were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the protein concentrations were determined by optical density measurements at 280 nm (OD 280 ), with the assumption that 1.35 A 280 corresponds to 1.0 mg/ml. Measurement of neutralizing activity of specific Fabs. Purified Fabs were used in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to determine their neutralizing activities against each of the three polio serotypes. Typically, approximately 50 PFU of Sabin poliovirus in 150 l of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were mixed with the same volume of serial dilutions of a Fab. The virus-Fab mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and added to confluent HeLa cells in a 6-well plate in duplicate. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, an overlay of DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.8% methyl cellulose was added and the plates were incubated in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C for 72 h. The plaques were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 5 min.

ELISA. The wells in a 96-well ELISA plate were coated with 100 l of poliovirus (OPV at a concentration of 5 ϫ 10 6 PFU/ml), followed by treatment with 3% milk in PBS. After being washed, the plate was incubated with serially 3-fold-diluted antipoliovirus IgG for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed, the plate was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against human Fc. The color was developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine reagent (KPL; Gaithersburg, MD), and the development was stopped with H 2 SO 4 after 10 min. The OD 450 was read in an ELISA plate reader. The data were plotted, and the dose-response curves were generated with Prism software (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).

Blocking ELISA. The test is based on materials and reagents developed in a previous study (32) . Amounts of 0.5 to 1.0 D antigen units/ml of poliovirus were captured on 96-well ELISA plates coated with purified rabbit polyclonal serotype-specific IgG (2 g/ml). Then, some wells containing captured antigen were incubated with serial dilutions of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) or polyclonal serum (blocking reaction), while control wells were treated with normal rabbit serum. Wells with no antigen served as a background control. Antipoliovirus antibodies reacted with their respective antigenic sites and blocked them from subsequent reaction with biotin-conjugated polyclonal antipolio IgG (0.5 g/ml). Next, ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000 dilution; Sigma) was added, and the reaction of bound peroxidase with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB, Sigma) resulted in the development of a color reaction. After the addition of a stop reagent (Sigma), the plate was scanned at 450 nm. The OD 450 in the background wells that contained no antigen corresponded to 100% blocking activity, and the OD 450 for antigen-containing wells incubated with normal rabbit serum corresponded to 0% blocking activity. The percentage of blocking activity of a specific MAb or serum with a particular antigen was calculated from the difference between the average ODs of blocked and nonblocked wells containing the same antigen. The final results for blocking of reactivity were calculated from the following formula: % blocking activity ϭ (average OD for wells containing normal rabbit serum Ϫ average OD for wells containing test serum)/(average OD for wells with normal rabbit serum Ϫ average OD for background wells with no antigen). The titer was defined as a serum dilution producing 50% blocking. Graphical linearization of S-shaped blocking ELISA titration curves was performed by plotting the logarithm of blocking activity/(1 Ϫ blocking activity) against the logarithm of dilution.

Polyclonal rabbit antisera were obtained by immunizing female rabbits with Sabin strains of poliovirus as described elsewhere (19) .

Microneutralization test. Poliovirus-neutralizing antibody titers were determined in a microneutralization test according to WHO recommendations (43) , with some modifications. The MAb samples were diluted to 1 g/ml in maintenance medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sterilized by filtration through Spin-X columns (Corning, Corning, NY). Two-fold serial dilutions of the antibodies starting at 1 g/ml were incubated in quadruplicate for 3 h at 36°C with 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of the respective poliovirus strain in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . After the incubation, 1 ϫ 10 4 HEp-2c cells were added to the wells. The plates were incubated for 10 days at 36°C, 5% CO 2 and evaluated microscopically, and neutralizing antibody titers were calculated using the Kärber formula.

Generation of escape mutants. The antibodies were diluted to approximately 200 g/ml in maintenance medium and sterilized by filtration through a Spin-X column. Four 5-fold dilutions of antibodies starting at 200 g/ml were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with approximately 10 8 TCID 50 of poliovirus, followed by incubation for 2 h at 36°C to allow for neutralization of susceptible virus. Monolayers of HEp-2c cells were inoculated with virus and incubated at 36°C, 5% CO 2 until cytopathic effect (CPE) developed. The virus-containing cell suspension was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles to release intracellular virus and then clarified by centrifugation, and the viral titer was determined by microtitration assay (43) .

For plaque purification, HEp-2c monolayers in 6-well plates were inoculated with serial dilutions of mutant viruses (10 1 to 10 4 TCID 50 /ml) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the medium was replaced with 4 ml modified Eagle's medium (MEM)-0.5% agarose overlay containing 6% FBS (Invitrogen). Plaques were picked after 48 h of incubation at 36°C, 5% CO 2 , transferred into 12-well plates with confluent HEp-2c monolayers, and incubated until CPE developed. Virus-containing cell suspensions were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles to release intracellular virus and then clarified by centrifugation.

Nucleotide sequencing. Viral RNA was isolated from virus-containing medium by using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with type-specific primers allowing amplification of the entire capsid region of poliovirus. Reaction mixtures were assembled according to the man-VOL. 85, 2011 CHIMPANZEE-HUMAN ANTIPOLIOVIRUS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES 4355

ufacturer's recommendations. The reverse transcription step was at 55°C for 90 min, followed by 15 min of incubation at 95°C and 40 cycles of PCR as follows: 20 s at 94°C for the denaturation step, 1 min at 65°C for the primer annealing step, and 3 min at 72°C for the elongation step. The results of RT-PCRs were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and amplified DNA was purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Both the RNA isolation and PCR purification steps were performed with a QIAcube automation station (Qiagen). Purified PCR products were sequenced by the regular Sanger method with type-specific primers covering both strands of DNA and spaced about 600 bp apart. Four primers were used to sequence each strand of DNA in the PCR products. Overlapping reads were assembled and aligned with reference Sabin sequences, using the Macintosh MacVector program package (MacVector, Inc., Cary, NC), and used to detect mutations relative to the sequence of the parental strain. Tg mouse challenge test. Transgenic Tg-PVR21 mice were obtained from the Central Institute for Experimental Animals (Tokyo, Japan). Maintenance, containment, and transportation of mice were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO Memorandum on transgenic mice susceptible to human viruses (2) . All experiments using mice were performed in accordance with the U.S. Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (28) .

In protection experiments, groups of 10 mice (5 males and 5 females) were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 1 g, 5 g, or 25 g of H2 antibody in 0.1 ml of PBS. For the control, one group of 10 animals was injected i.v. with 0.1 ml of PBS. After 24 h, all animals were challenged intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 times the 50% paralytic dose (PD 50 ) of wild-type poliovirus Mahoney strain. Mice were observed for signs of paresis/paralysis for 14 days.

In a postexposure treatment experiment, groups of 10 mice, equal numbers of males and females, were challenged i.m. with 5 PD 50 of Mahoney virus, and 6 or 12 h later injected i.v. with 5 g or 25 g of H2 antibody. A control group received PBS instead of H2. Animals were observed for clinical signs for 2 weeks.

A phage Fab display library constructed from bone marrow-derived lymphocytes of chimpanzees immunized with poliovirus was panned for three cycles against polioviruses of each serotype. The phage-Fab clones specific to each of three serotypes were identified by phage ELISA. The sequencing analysis of the variable domain of heavy (V H ) and light (V L ) chains showed that nine clones specific to serotype 1, three clones specific to serotype 2, and seven clones specific to serotype 3 were recovered. These positive clones were subsequently converted to produce soluble Fabs. Each soluble Fab was confirmed for its specific binding to its panning antigen (Table 1) . Further measurement of their neutralization activities by PRNT showed that Fabs A12 and H2, Fabs A6 and B2, and Fabs B10, A2, E3, and C10 neutralized Sabin poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 1) . Six Fab clones (A12, H2, A6, B2, B10, and C10) had relatively higher neutralizing activities and, therefore, were selected for conversion to fulllength IgGs (referred to hereinafter as MAbs) and further characterization. The closest human V-gene germ line usage and possible somatic mutations for each of these six poliovirusneutralizing MAbs were identified by conducting sequence similarity searches of all of the known human Ig genes compiled in the IMGT database at http://www.imgt.org/. The analysis showed that family 3 of heavy chain genes and family 1 of kappa chain genes were overrepresented. Both V H and V L genes were highly mutated, since identities of 85 to 90% for V H and 90 to 96% for V L in comparison to germ line V-gene were observed ( Table 2 ), suggesting that significant affinity maturation may have taken place.

Specificity of poliovirus-neutralizing MAbs. Each of the six poliovirus-neutralizing MAbs was examined by ELISA for binding to poliovirus serotype 1, 2, and 3 virions immobilized on a 96-well plate. MAbs A12 and H2 recovered from panning In vitro neutralizing activity c The V H and V L genes before the CDR3 region were used to calculate the percentage of nucleic acid identity. The mutations in the first 20 bp were excluded since these mutations could be introduced by PCR primers. c There was a 3-bp insertion in the CDR2 region in addition to the 93% identity.

against type 1 poliovirus were the only ones that reacted with Sabin 1 virus (Fig. 1A) . Interestingly, MAb A12 exhibited dual specificity by reacting with both Sabin 1 and Sabin 2 polioviruses (Fig. 1B) . MAbs A6 and B2 that were selected by panning against type 2 poliovirus reacted well with Sabin 2 poliovirus (Fig. 1B) . MAbs B10 and C10 that were recovered from panning against type 3 poliovirus reacted well with Sabin 3 (Fig. 1C) . Sabin 3 virus also reacted weakly with type 1-specific MAbs A12 and H2. Direct ELISA may not necessarily reflect functional inter-actions that lead to neutralization because it can detect relatively weak binding between antibodies and antigens. Previously, we showed that the blocking ELISA procedure in which MAbs are used to compete with neutralizing polyclonal serum is much more predictive of the functional interactions and that its results correlate well with neutralization test results (32) . The results in Table 3 show that, indeed, weak interactions between type 1-specific antibodies A12 and H2 and Sabin 3 poliovirus that were detected in a previous experiment did not occur in this setting. However, type 1-specific A12 antibody strongly reacted with type 2 poliovirus, suggesting that it may neutralize two serotypes of poliovirus. In another experiment, the blocking ELISA was performed with various concentrations of MAbs using both attenuated Sabin and wild polioviruses as antigens (Fig. 2) . With the exception of type 3-specific MAb B10 that reacted equally well with the Sabin 3 and wild Saukett strains, all other MAbs reacted better with Sabin strains than with wild strains of the same serotype. The difference was especially pronounced for type 2-specific antibody A6 that practically did not block wild MEF-1 poliovirus. Table 4 showed that all MAbs selected against each serotype effectively neutralized homotypic viruses. In addition, and consistent with the ELISA data, the A12 MAb neutralized both type 1 and type 2 polioviruses. While some MAbs, such as A12 and H2, neutralized both Sabin and wild strains of poliovirus, others exhibited a significant bias for Sabin strains. The neutralizing titer of MAb A6 tested against wild MEF-1 was more than 1,000 times lower than against the Sabin 2 strain. MAbs B2, B10, and C10 had about 10-to 100-fold lower neutralizing activities against wild-type than against Sabin strains.

Cross-neutralization of different serotypes of poliovirus is a relatively unknown phenomenon. It is difficult if not impossible to study it in humans because of the maternal antibodies present in newborn children and, also, because routinely used vaccines are trivalent. Therefore, we assessed whether rabbit antisera raised by immunization with purified monovalent polioviruses would demonstrate any evidence of cross-neutralization. The data in Table 5 show that there was very little cross neutralization among serotypes, suggesting that polyspecific antibodies do not represent a majority of neutralizing antibodies in rabbit polyclonal antisera. Localization of neutralization epitopes. To identify epitopes to which the primate MAbs bind, we selected escape mutants by treating Sabin polioviruses with the antibodies, plaque purifying the resistant strains, and sequencing their RNA to identify mutations that rendered the strains resistant to neutralization. We were able to generate escape mutants to antibodies specific to types 1 and 2 but failed to obtain resistant variants of type 3 poliovirus.

The H2-resistant mutants contained several mutations, the most frequent being D 1219 G and D 1219 E in VP1, located close to antigenic site 2. Other mutations making the virus resistant to H2 antibody were in VP3 (K 3144 R,E,T), in the vicinity of the first mutation but closer to antigenic site 3, also composed of VP3 (Fig. 3) . Different mutations at the same amino acid site appeared to produce different effects on the blocking ELISA reactivity of the strains. For instance, the blocking activity of H2 antibody measured with D 1219 G virus was stronger than that measured with D 1219 E (8% Ϯ 3% [mean Ϯ standard deviation] and 20% Ϯ 12%, respectively).

The resistant strains generated in response to the dual-reactive antibody A12 also contained an unusual pattern of mutations. All clones isolated from the Sabin 1 strain contained a V 1166 E mutation, while clones isolated from the Sabin 2 strain contained a G 1225 D mutation (Fig. 4) . Some Sabin 1 escape clones also contained I 1090 M. It may not be necessary for the resistance, because this mutation leads to a direct reversion to the Mahoney amino acid, and Mahoney virus is sensitive to A12. Mutation V 1166 E was not previously identified as a part of an antigenic site 1 but is located close to it on the virion surface close to the canyon surrounding the 5-fold axis of symmetry. In contrast, mutation G 1225 D, which makes the Sabin 2 strain resistant to the same A12 antibody, is located on the opposite side of the canyon and is part of antigenic site 2. Thus, it appears that A12 binds the virion by interacting with both sides of the canyon, at the bottom of which the binding site for cellular receptor is located (3, 9, 42) .

The escape mutants generated in response to type 2-specific antibodies A6 and B2 contained mutations R 1100 C,L and A 1101 D, respectively, both located in the B-C loop in VP1 protein that was previously defined as epitope 1.

Pre-and postexposure protection of mice from infection by virulent poliovirus. To determine whether the MAbs can protect against poliomyelitis in vivo, we intravenously inoculated Tg-21PVR transgenic mice expressing human poliovirus receptor CD155 with various doses of H2 MAb and challenged them intramuscularly with 10 50% paralytic doses (PD 50 ) of wild poliovirus (Mahoney strain). Table 6 shows that 1 g of MAb protected 30% of the mice and 5 g protected 100%. The average neutralizing titers in serum in the 5-g and 1-g groups were 1:32 and 1:9, respectively, consistent with the common notion that a neutralization titer of 1:8 protects against polio. The protective effect of the MAbs is quite predictable, considering the high potency of the antibodies. It is also important to determine whether the antibodies could be used to prevent paralytic disease if administered after exposure to the virus. The results shown in Table 7 demonstrate that some mice survived challenge with a 5-PD 50 dose if they were treated with 5 or 25 g of H2 antibody at either 6 or 12 h after infection. There was a clear protective effect, even though not all mice survived. This observation suggests that these antibodies could be used for emergency prophylaxis of nonimmune individuals exposed to poliovirus.

Here, we describe the isolation of chimeric chimpanzeehuman antipoliovirus antibodies by combining hyperimmunization of chimpanzees with phage Fab display library technology, a method previously used to isolate humanized MAbs against a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens (5) (6) (7) . Compared to other methods based on human hybridoma technology (11) and B-cell immortalization with Epstein-Barr virus (37, 38) , the method described in this communication has the advantage of producing cloned immunoglobulin genes that could be used directly for the production of antibodies expressed in vitro, as well as for genetic manipulations that could improve their therapeutic properties.

The antigenic structure of polioviruses has been extensively studied in the past (26) . There are three distinct serotypes of poliovirus that are defined by their inability to be cross-neutralized by sera raised against the two other serotypes (30) . Elucidation of the molecular structure of poliovirus and the introduction of MAb technology allowed epitopes to mouse MAbs to be mapped on the surface of polio virions. Mutations rendering poliovirus resistant to MAbs identify epitopes with which the antibodies interact. Epitopes to different MAbs are clustered into several structural regions (antigenic sites) on the surface of polio virions (18, 40) . Studies with three serotypes of poliovirus identified three or four such antigenic sites. Antigenic site 1 is composed of the so-called B-C loop and the adjacent regions within VP1, while three other antigenic sites are composed of a combination of different capsid proteins, in some cases belonging to adjacent capsomers. Most poliovirus epitopes are believed to be conformational and are very sensitive to disruption of the virion structure.

Very little is known about human antipolio antibodies, but there is circumstantial evidence that their repertoire may be different from those in mice (33) . The MAbs from chimpanzees, the closest relatives of humans, described in this paper support this notion. One interesting observation is the dual specificity of antibody A12. It binds and neutralizes both type 1 and type 2 polioviruses. The results of our cross-neutralization experiments with hyperimmune rabbit antisera suggest that such dual-specific antibodies may not exist in the rabbit immunoglobulin repertoire. However, there are indications that such cross-neutralizing antibodies may not be uncommon in human antisera. Uhlig and Dernick (39) isolated four immortalized clones of human B cells producing neutralizing antipoliovirus antibodies. One of the antibodies neutralized both type 1 and 2 polioviruses, and another neutralized all three serotypes, albeit at a lower potency for types 2 and 3. In another study, a mouse monoclonal antibody was shown to neutralize both type 1 and type 2 poliovirus (41) . The epitope for this antibody was mapped at amino acid residues 239 to 245 of VP2, far from the binding site of A12. Therefore, the dualreacting A12 antibody may represent a class of cross-neutralizing antibodies the role of which has been underestimated. Further studies of human antibodies are needed to assess the magnitude of this phenomenon. The method described in this communication is well suited for targeted screening for crossneutralizing antibodies by phage display panning of Fab fragments induced by one serotype against antigens of another serotype.

The existence of cross-neutralizing antibodies goes against the common belief that underlies the classification of polioviruses into three serotypes. This classification is based on neutralization tests performed with hyperimmune animal sera that may not contain cross-neutralizing antibodies. It is very difficult to study this question in humans either epidemiologically or experimentally. Cross-reacting antibodies in monkey sera were revealed in complement fixation testing (23) , and some circumstantial evidence based on the comparison of IPV-induced seroconversion of completely immunologically naïve children and children who have been exposed to heterologous wild polioviruses suggests that there may be some cross-serotypic priming effect (15) . We successfully isolated escape mutants of type 1 and type 2 poliovirus but were unable to isolate type 3 antibody-resistant strains. The reason for this is unknown and may be related to the extremely high potency of type 3 antibodies, the inability to disrupt virus-antibody interactions by one mutation, or low viability of the resulting escape mutants. Some of the epitopes that bind to the MAbs described here map to the antigenic sites previously identified for mouse antibodies, while others may have a different binding mechanism. For instance, the dual type 1-/type 2-specific antibody A12 appears to bind to both antigenic sites 1 and 2 and, thus, fills the canyon on the virion surface where the receptor-binding site is located (3, 9, 42) . Interestingly, one of the antibody-resistant mutations generated in response to A12 treatment (G 1225 D) was previously shown to reduce binding to the cellular receptor by 7-to 14-fold (9) . Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that antibody A12 prevents virus from binding to its cellular receptor. Comparison of the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of relevant parts of Sabin 1 and Sabin 2 capsid proteins shows that they are similar, and amino acid differences in this region involve chemically similar amino acids. This provides an explanation of the dual reactivity of the A12 antibody. Another antibody, H2, binds to the space between antigenic sites 2 and 3. Therefore, parts of the virion that are immunologically important in mice and chimpanzees appear to differ. Further studies of native human antibodies to poliovirus are needed to better define antigenic sites.

The utility of passive immunotherapy for the prevention of poliomyelitis has been well documented in the past (16) . Previous attempts to use intravenous immunoglobulin and breast milk were unsuccessful, even though a significant temporary decrease in shedding was observed when the patient was treated with breast milk (22) . The failure to completely stop shedding may be due to insufficient levels of antipoliovirus antibodies in IVIG and breast milk. The availability of highly potent human-like antibodies to poliovirus opens the possibility of curing chronically infected individuals of their poliovirus infection, thereby stopping shedding of virus into the environment. The addition of the recombinant chimpanzee-human antibodies described here could boost neutralizing titers to extremely high levels and thereby resolve chronic infection. The efficacy of the monoclonal antibodies must be evaluated in clinical trials that are now planned.

The transgenic mouse data presented here suggest that the antibodies can protect against poliomyelitis not only when given prior to infection but also after exposure to poliovirus. This means that the antibodies can stop the development of the infectious process even after it has started. This raises the possibility of using them for emergency prophylaxis of contacts of a paralytic polio case or to prevent the spread of poliovirus should it reemerge after apparent eradication. Under these circumstances, emergency vaccinations will be performed to stop the outbreak. Adding treatment with antipoliovirus antibodies to this intervention will result in immediate protection of the individuals involved while allowing the longer-term effect of a vaccine to develop.

In conclusion, the findings presented in this communication open the possibilities of better characterizing human immune responses to poliovirus and of producing therapeutic reagents useful for polio eradication and transition to a polio-free world.

Immunogenicity and Protection Efficacy of Subunit-based Smallpox Vaccines Using Variola Major Antigens,"The viral strain responsible for smallpox infection is variola major (VARV). As a result of the successful eradication of smallpox with the vaccinia virus (VACV), the general population is no longer required to receive a smallpox vaccine, and will have no protection against smallpox. This lack of immunity is a concern due to the potential for use of smallpox as a biological weapon. Considerable progress has been made in the development of subunit-based smallpox vaccines resulting from the identification of VACV protective antigens. It also offers the possibility of using antigens from VARV to formulate the next generation subunit-based smallpox vaccines. Here, we show that codon-optimized DNA vaccines expressing three VARV antigens (A30, B7 and F8) and their recombinant protein counterparts elicited high-titer, cross-reactive, VACV neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Vaccinated mice were protected from intraperitoneal and intranasal challenges with VACV. These results suggest the feasibility of a subunit smallpox vaccine based on the VARV antigen sequences to induce immunity against poxvirus infection.","The original smallpox vaccine, based on the live attenuated vaccinia virus (VACV), eradicated smallpox from the worldwide human population with the last case of natural smallpox infection occurring in Somalia in 1977 (WHO, 1980 . However, due to safety concerns over the manufacture of the traditional VACV vaccine, the production of this type of vaccine, such as DryVax (Wyeth Laboratories, Inc.) in the United States and derived from the NYCBH strain of vaccinia virus, is no longer considered acceptable since termination of its production in 1982. Reports of adverse events including myocarditis that are associated with immunization with VACV (Casey et al., 2005) have prevented the completion of a 2002 re-vaccination campaign among non-military high-risk populations, such as healthcare professionals. Currently, VACV is still the main smallpox vaccine and a newer generation of live-attenuated VACV vaccines is being produced in tissue cultured cells to allow for stockpiling in hopes of being able to protect the general population in the event of a bioterrorist attack (Artenstein et al., 2005; Fang et al., 2006; Monath et al., 2004) .

Recent studies have made great strides in demonstrating the use of subunit-based smallpox vaccines to induce protective immunity against smallpox. Poxviruses, which include variola major (VARV), vaccinia virus (VACV), monkeypox virus, ectromelia virus (ECTV) and others, belong to the orthopoxvirus genus and considerable cross-protection has been observed between these viruses. Poxviruses are large viruses with a genome that encodes about 200 proteins and it is this complexity which has partly delayed the identification of protective antigens against these viruses. Several potential targets of protective immunity have only recently been confirmed in well organized animal studies. There are two forms of infectious poxvirus: the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). Recent studies have shown that vaccinia virus IMV-specific antigens, A27, L1 and D8, and EEV-specific antigens, A33 and B5, are immunogenic and protective, albeit variably, against VACV infection in mice (Fogg et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) , against ectromelia virus (ECTV) (Xiao et al., 2007) , and against monkeypox in non-human primates (Heraud et al., 2006; Hooper et al., 2004) . Furthermore, a four-gene combination DNA vaccine that encodes two IMV (A27 and L1) and two EEV (A33 and B5) antigens was protective against vaccinia virus challenge in mice and induced antibody responses against monkeypox virus in non-human primates (Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003) . However, these subunit vaccines were not as protective as the live-attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine unless polyvalent formulations and/or multiple immunizations are used to achieve comparable levels of protection inducible by one single vaccinia inoculation (Fogg et al., 2004; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) .

Why the live-vaccinia virus vaccine offers better protection against infection is unclear and studies have been conducted to examine the contributions of the two arms of the immune system in offering protective immunity against poxvirus infection by depletion of B-and T-cells prior to primary and/or secondary challenge with various poxviruses, offering conflicting results. Antibody-mediated depletion of B-cells, but not of CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells, prevented vaccineinduced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with monkeypox virus (Edghill-Smith et al., 2005) and poxvirus in a mouse model (Belyakov et al., 2003) indicating that this protective response is primarily mediated by antibodies and that vaccinia-induced antibodies are necessary and sufficient for protection against a lethal poxvirus challenge. Additional results confirming the role of antibody responses show that passive administration of VACV antibodies confers protection from subsequent lethal monkeypox (Edghill-Smith et al., 2005; Hooper et al., 2004) and that type I/II IFN deficient, CD8+ depleted mice were able to survive a secondary infection with ECTV (Panchanathan, Chaudhri, and Karupiah, 2005) . However, to determine immune responses in primary and secondary vaccination against smallpox in humans, a recent study has shown that positive CMI responses could be elicited seven days after infection in secondary immunized volunteers (i.e., vaccinia non-naïve) and that this response preceded increases in antibody titers (Kennedy et al., 2004) . Furthermore, an important role for interferon (IFN) and less of a role for antibodies in conferring protection against poxvirus was observed following a primary infection (Panchanathan, Chaudhri, and Karupiah, 2005; Pulford et al., 2004) . While the exact roles of each arm of the immune system in mediating poxvirus infection have not been completely elucidated, the majority of recent reports point to a greater role of antibodies against various poxvirus antigens in eliciting protection against poxvirus infection. Therefore, it appears as though subunit-based smallpox vaccines that induce poxvirus-specific antibodies would be effective in conferring protection from poxvirus infection.

Although poxviruses are highly conserved in the regions that encode protective antigens, it is not clear whether antibodies induced by variola antigens may confer a higher level of protection against homologous challenge when compared to those responses induced by vaccinia antigens. A recent study examining the differences between the major neutralizing B5 antigenic site on vaccinia virus and it's variola virus ortholog B6 demonstrated that from a panel of 26 anti-B5 monoclonal antibodies only 16 cross reacted with B6 protein and out of 10 that did not at least 3 were EEV neutralizing or blocked comet formation (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) . These results indicate that the production of a subunit-based vaccine using VARV antigens rather than those from VACV may confer greater protection against smallpox infection and there is no apparent reason not to use VARV antigens with a subunit-based vaccine. While safety issues over using the variola virus itself as a live attenuated vaccine lead to the use of antigens from the vaccinia virus, the production of a subunit-based vaccine does not incorporate live viruses into its design and therefore eliminates the safety concerns over using variola virus antigens.

The goal of this current study was to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a subunit smallpox vaccine based on VARV antigen sequences. At least in theory, this approach should minimize the chance of reduced protection due to any sequence difference that may exist between VARV and VACV, particularly when antigen-specific immune responses, such as neutralizing antibody determinants and/or dominant T-cell epitopes, are involved. In the current study, three VARV antigens (A30, B7 and F8) were chosen based on the high immunogenicity and potential of protection from their VACV counterparts (A27, B5 and D8) as shown in literature and from our recently published studies (Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) .

Amino acid sequences of three well-characterized protective antigens (A27, B5 and D8) from VACV were compared with orthologous proteins from the VARV virus (Fig 1) . For VACV sequences, two frequently used strains, Western Reserve (WR) and Copenhagen (COP), were included for the analysis. For VARV, the India 1967 (VARV-IND) and Bangladesh 1975 (VARV-BSH) strain sequences were used. The orthologous VARV protein for the VACV A27 antigen is A30 for VARV-IND and A31 for VARV-BSH; for the B5 antigen the orthologous protein is B7 for VARV-IND and B6 for VARV-BSH, and for the D8 antigen the orthologous protein for both VARV-IND and VARV-BSH is F8 (Shchelkunov, 1995; Shchelkunov, Massung, and Esposito, 1995) . Sequences of these three proteins are highly homologous but not completely identical to the VACV antigen sequences: three amino acid differences exist between A27 and A30/A31, 23 amino acid differences between B5 and B6/B7 and 12 amino acid differences between D8 and F8 proteins (Fig 1) . Some of these differences occurred with only one of the two VARV strains, thereby further improving the overall level of homology.

The codon modified A30L, B7R and F8L genes of VARV-IND were chemically synthesized without the involvement of actual variola virus. Although the final codons did not change what amino acids were coded, this procedure increases the frequency of codons that are used by mammalian cells and has been shown to potentially improve antigen expression and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines (Haas, Park, and Seed, 1996; Wang et al., 2006) Then the synthetic genes coding for the VARV A30, F8 or B7 proteins were individually cloned into the DNA vaccine vector pSW3891, which uses a CMV IE promoter to drive the expression of the coded antigen insert (Wang et al., 2005) . In addition, they were all placed behind a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence which was shown to be effective in improving the antigen expression and antigen immunogenicity for DNA vaccines . A30 and F8 DNA vaccines encode for the full-length proteins while B7 DNA vaccine expresses the ectodomain of B7 because the full-length B7 DNA vaccine can not achieve a good antigen expression (data not shown).

Expression of these codon-optimized VARV antigen DNA vaccines was verified in culture supernatants and cell lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with each of the three VARV antigen DNA plasmids and examined by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-vaccinia virus serum (Fig. 2) . All three antigens were present in both the cell lysate (L) and culture supernatant (S) and their molecular weights, in general, matched those from the VACV-WR strain grown in Vero cells, except B7 DNA vaccine which only expresses a smaller molecular weight ectodomain of B7 protein. The apparent molecular weight of B7 antigen in lysate was slightly larger than B7 in supernatant -indicating additional post-translational processing of B7 protein as an intermediate product prior to secretion. Non-transfected 293T cells and uninfected Vero cells did not show pox-specific antigens (Fig. 2 ). In addition, we show that recombinant A30, B7 and F8 proteins (rA30, rF8 and rB7) were successfully produced and purified from an E. coli expression system using the same synthetic A30, B7 and F8 genes ( Fig  2) . These results also show that the B7 protein forms dimers in its non-denatured condition. According to sequence analysis, the B7 protein has potential sites for N-glycosylation which was confirmed by its sensitivity to PNGase treatment (Fig 2) .

Three monthly immunizations with VARV DNA vaccines elicited high levels of antigenspecific IgG antibody responses in mice (Fig. 3) . The immunogenicity of each DNA vaccine is slightly different: A30 being the most immunogenic, followed by the F8 and B7 DNA vaccines. Antibodies induced by immunization with codon optimized variola DNA vaccines recognized both vaccinia and variola antigens expressed in the supernatant of transiently transfected 293T cells. Given the polyclonal nature of the immune sera, it was not surprising that we did not detect a significant difference in recognition of variola or vaccinia antigens by ELISA (Fig. 3) .

Immunization with DNA vaccines, expressing the two individual VARV IMV antigens, F8 and A30, produced antibodies that were able to neutralize VACV in a plaque reduction assay that measures IMV antibodies (Fig. 4) . The levels of neutralizing antibodies were similar to immune sera elicited by their individual VACV counterparts, D8 and A27. Similar to the previous report with VACV IMV antigens (Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) , the subunit VARV IMV antigens were more effective than an intact vaccinia infection in eliciting IMV neutralizing antibodies in the current study.

We tested the ability of mono-and polyvalent DNA vaccines that expressed VARV antigens to induce protection in two VACV challenge models. In the first challenge study, mice first received three monthly DNA immunizations, rested for 1 month, and received another boost 2 weeks prior to challenge to ensure a complete protection in this pilot study. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a lethal dose (5 × 10 7 pfu) of VACV (WR). VARV antigen-specific antibodies after 1, 2, or 3 monovalent DNA vaccine inoculations were measured by ELISA (Fig. 5A ). DNA vaccines expressing each of the three VARV antigens induced high titers of antibodies after the 2nd immunization and additional DNA vaccination was not needed to further boost the levels of antibody responses (Fig. 5A) . As an indicator of protection against lethal VACV in this i.p. challenge model, average weight loss of the surviving mice in each group was measured (Fig. 5B ). All negative control mice inoculated with the DNA vector progressively lost weight and died by Day 5. Mice that received either the mono-or polyvalent VARV DNA vaccines survived the challenge and regained body weight. Mice that received the polyvalent VARV DNA vaccine recovered back to their initial body weight sooner than mice that received any of the monovalent DNA vaccines (Fig 5B) . The polyvalent VARV and polyvalent VACV formulations were able to achieve similar levels of protection (Fig. 5C ).

Although intraperitoneal VACV challenge leads to lethal poxvirus infection, it does not represent the natural aerosol spread of the virus. The intranasal method of infection requires significantly less virus to produce a lethal infection and causes death at a later time point suggesting a different virus-host interaction. In addition, the intranasal mode of infection represents a more stringent challenge model (Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) . Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of protection when subunit-based VARV antigens were delivered in the form of DNA or recombinant protein vaccines in an intranasal challenge model.

In this intranasal challenge study, groups of mice received 2 bi-weekly immunizations of either a polyvalent rA30, rB7 and rF8 recombinant protein vaccine or a polyvalent DNA vaccine expressing the A30, B7 and F8 antigens (Fig. 6 ). The number of immunizations were reduced to two based on the excellent immune responses after two immunizations as shown in the i.p. challenge studies (Fig. 5 ). Mice immunized with the vaccinia vaccine served as a positive control, and the negative control group received only empty DNA vector (Fig. 6 ). Antigenspecific antibodies induced by either the DNA or protein formulations and immunizations with vaccinia vaccine were analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 6A) . Immunization with the polyvalent recombinant VARV protein vaccines was significantly more immunogenic than immunization with the polyvalent VARV DNA vaccines (p<0.01) (Fig. 6A) based on ELISA results. The protein vaccine was even more immunogenic than the live vaccinia vaccine in generating specific antibodies against three tested pox antigens. In contrast, immunization with the polyvalent DNA-based VARV vaccines induced only marginally higher antibody responses when compared to immunization with VACV, except for the B7-specific antibody, which probably occurred as a result of very low anti-B7 antibody responses in VACV immunized mice.

Mice were challenged with a lethal intranasal dose of VACV (WR) (5 × 10 6 pfu) two weeks after the 2 nd immunization. While all mice in the control group died by Day 11 (Fig. 6B) , mice that received either the polyvalent recombinant VARV protein vaccination or the vaccinia vaccine immunization were fully protected, as indicated by a 100% survival rate following the intranasal challenge (Fig. 6B ). Two immunizations with the polyvalent DNA vaccine induced partial protection with 4 out of 5 mice surviving by Day 14 (Fig. 6B ). Both protein and DNA subunit vaccine formulations induced statistically significant greater levels of protection when compared to the vector control group (p=0.0017 and p=0.0211, respectively), as determined by Kaplan Meier survival test.

Over the past few years, progress has been made which establishes the use of subunit-based smallpox vaccines delivered in the form of DNA plasmids (Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003; Hooper et al., 2007; Hooper et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006) or recombinant proteins (Davies et al., 2005; Fang et al., 2006; Fogg et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999; Heraud et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) to induce antibodies and/ or protection against poxvirus infection. This has been made possible through the identification of the immunogenic and protective vaccinia virus IMV-specific antigens (e.g., A27, L1 and D8) and EEV-specific antigens (e.g. A33 and B5). These antigens have shown to be immunogenic and protective against VACV infection in mice (Fogg et al., 2004; Galmiche et al., 1999; Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper et al., 2004; Pulford et al., 2004; Sakhatskyy et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) , against ectromelia virus (ECTV) (Xiao et al., 2007) , and against monkeypox virus in non-human primates (Heraud et al., 2006; Hooper et al., 2004) . Despite this great progress, these previous studies used antigen genes cloned from VACV or monkeypox virus rather than those from VARV to induce broad and protective antibody responses mainly due to safety concerns over using VARV as a model and to the difficulty in producing VARV infection in species other than humans and some non-human primates. Although the sequences are very similar between these viruses (i.e., VACV or monkeypox virus) and VARV, they are not completely identical. In a recent study, the properties of the vaccinia virus EEV protein B5 and its Variola ortholog B6 were compared in order to determine whether B6 is a better choice as a subunit vaccine against smallpox. This study found that from a panel of 26 anti-B5 monoclonal antibodies only 16 cross reacted with B6 protein and out of the 10 that did not, at least 3 were EEV neutralizing or blocked comet formation (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) . With current technology, it has become possible to produce synthetic gene sequences based on the known VARV protein sequences, which may be more immunologically desirable in producing immune responses against smallpox infection than the genes from another pox virus. It could be argued that VARV-based antigens should be more compatible with the invading smallpox infection than VACV antigens although the definitive proof can only be obtained in a VARV challenge study which is not readily available due to security control of VARV reagents.

In the current study, we produced subunit-based smallpox vaccines that are based on the three VARV protective antigens, A30, B7 and F8, which are orthologous of the IMV antigens A27 and D8 and the EEV antigen B5 from VACV. The sequences of these three VARV proteins are homologous but not identical with the VACV antigen sequences, as only three amino acid differences exist between A27 and A30, 23 amino acid differences between B5 and B7 and 12 amino acid differences between D8 and F8. While these VACV antigens have been shown to elicit a good level of protection from intranasal VACV challenge (Pulford et al., 2004) , there have been no reports showing whether DNA or recombinant protein vaccines based on the VARV protective antigens are able to induce neutralizing antibodies and protection against VACV.

Here, we show that immunization with codon optimized monovalent DNA vaccines that express the F8 and A30 VARV antigens elicited antibodies that were able to neutralize VACV, as measured in a plaque reduction assay. Furthermore, when these VARV antigens were given in combination, they induced neutralizing responses similar to those produced by their VACV counterparts, D8 and A27 when administered in combination (data not shown). This increase in immunogenicity after administration of a combination of antigens compared to when administered as a monovalent formulation is consistent with studies done with VACV antigens. Immunization with DNA vaccines encoding for a single VACV membrane protein induced only modest anti-VACV reactivity (Pulford et al., 2004 ) as compared to when these antigens were given in combination (Hooper et al., 2000; Hooper, Custer, and Thompson, 2003) . Mice that were vaccinated with polyvalent (i.e., A30, F8 and B7) VARV antigen DNA vaccines were protected from intraperitoneal challenge. When the VACV challenge was administered intranasally, mice that were immunized with either the polyvalent recombinant protein or DNA vaccines were protected. Furthermore, we observed that with only two immunizations, the protein-based subunit vaccine was more effective than DNA vaccines in eliciting higher antibody responses and better protection in the dose ranges tested in the current study with the adjuvant used for protein immunization. Since the current study was not designed to compare the difference between DNA and protein based VARV vaccines, more dedicated studies, especially in non-human primates, are needed to further identify any qualitative and quantitative differences in immunogenicity and protective efficacy for these two types of VARV vaccines.

In summary, a vaccine based on antigens from the VARV virus can confer protective immunity against both intranasal and intraperitoneal challenge with the vaccinia virus and induce neutralizing antibodies against VACV. Given the decreased cross-reactivity of anti-B5 VACV antigens with B6 antigens of variola major (Aldaz-Carroll, 2007) , our study demonstrated that it is feasible that a variola major antigen-based vaccine can be produced and may potentially confer more matched immune responses and/or greater protection following exposure to VARV. Results from this study show that there is no apparent advantage of substituting original VARV antigens for their orthologs from less virulent poxviruses, as indicated by the similar levels of neutralizing antibodies and levels of protection against VACV challenge between the VARV antigen-based vaccines, developed in this study, and the orthologous VACV antigens. Results from the current study suggest that future efforts in the development of subunit-based smallpox vaccines may be better suited to focus on optimizing the conditions necessary to elicit immunological responses from the variola major protective antigens themselves rather than those from the vaccinia virus.

Western Reserve strain of vaccinia virus (VACV-WR) provided by Dr. Lisa Selin from University of Massachusetts Medical School, was propagated in Vero cells and clarified cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis and ELISA. VACV stock for challenge was prepared in L929 cells (Selin, Nahill, and Welsh, 1994) and purified from serum contaminants by centrifugation on sucrose gradients (Chen et al., 2001) . Viral titer assays were performed on Vero cells (Selin, Nahill, and Welsh, 1994) .

Individual variola (VARV) genes, with modified codon usage, were synthesized based on variola major India1967 (VARV-IND) sequences. Sequences of orthopoxviruses were derived from NCBI genome database and aligned using MacVector 7.0. DNA inserts were then subcloned into pSW3891 immediately after the CMV immediate early (IE) promoter (Wang et al., 2005) . For VARV DNA vaccines reported in this study, an additional human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) sequence was used to enhance the antigen expression based on previous reports . The PCR amplified VARV genes were subcloned into the same vector downstream of the tPA leader sequence which was already included in the vector (Wang et al., 2004) . Each DNA vaccine plasmid transformed in E. coli (HB101 strain) was confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing before large amounts of DNA plasmids were prepared with a Mega purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In this report, VARV antigen related vaccines are referred to as A30, B7 and F8, the recombinant VARV proteins are referred to as rA30, rB7 and rF8, and the VACV antigens are referred to as A27, B5 and D8.

Histidine-tagged antigen gene sequences of vaccinia (A27, D8, B5) or variola viruses (A30, F8, B7) were cloned into the pET-15b vector (Invitrogen). Constructs were than transformed into DE3 competent cells for expression. The transformed cells were grown overnight at 37°C and inoculated at 5% into LB medium. The culture was grown until cell density measured at A600 reached O.D. range of 0.6 to 1.0. Then Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to reach a final concentration 0.4-0.8 mM for the induction of protein expression. Cells were harvested 3 hours later and lysed by sonication.

Recombinant proteins were then loaded onto Ni column (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After washing the unbound proteins with 20mM imidazole, the target protein was eluted by 250mM imidazole in 8M urea lysis buffer. The purified proteins were refolded by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentration and purity were determined by SDS gel.

Six to eight week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and housed in the Department of Animal Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) in accordance with IACUC and IBC approved protocols. The animals were immunized with a Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad) at the shaved abdominal skin as previously reported (Wang et al., 2004) . Two DNA immunization schedules were used in this report (see figure legend for details). Each mouse received 4 monthly or 2 bi-weekly immunizations with six DNA shots of 2 μg each per immunization. Immunogenicity was studied in 10 mice per group and each challenge study group consisted of 5 mice. The blood samples were collected peri-orbitally prior to the first immunization and 2 weeks after each immunization. Mice immunized with VACV received 10 5 pfu of VACV in 10 μl of PBS by intradermal inoculation into the ear pinnae 1 month before challenge (Tscharke, Reading, and Smith, 2002; Tscharke and Smith, 1999) . Mice immunized with proteins received 2 bi-weekly immunizations with purified recombinant proteins (10 μg per injection) in PBS emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant.

293T cells were transiently transfected with a calcium chloride co-precipitation method using 10 μg of plasmid DNA for 2 × 10 6 cells in a 60-mm dish. Cells were harvested 72 h later. Both supernatants and cell lysates were collected for ELISA or Western blot assays. Supernatants from multiple dishes were pooled and the amount of antigen was determined by Coomassie blue staining of SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels.

Vaccinia virus antigen-specific IgG responses in immunized mice were measured by ELISA using individual mouse sera from each animal group. ELISA plates were coated with 100 μl of the antigens at 1 μg/ml harvested from 293T cells transiently transfected with the DNA vaccine plasmids and incubated overnight at 4°C. (Wyatt et al., 2004) . Serially diluted mouse sera (100 μl) was added to each well and assayed in duplicate after blocking. The plates were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted at 1:1000 (100 μl per well), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories) diluted at 1:2000 and finally developed with 3,3-,5,5-tetramethybenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution (100 μl per well). The reactions were stopped by adding 25μl of 2M H 2 SO 4 , and the plates were read at OD450.

The same amount of transiently expressed antigens (10 ng of protein) were loaded for the SDSpolyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer (0.2% I-block, 0.1% Tween-20 in 1X PBS). Membranes were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit sera immunized with the corresponding DNA vaccines. After being washed, blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tropix, Bedford, MA) at 1:5000 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature, and signals were detected using a chemiluminescence Western-Light Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) . For the glycosylation study, Peptide N-Glycosidase F, PNGaseF (New England BioLab, Beverly, MA) was added to the denatured samples prepared from the supernatants of transiently transfected 293T cells per manufacturer's specifications. After incubating overnight at 37°C, samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot as described above.

Fifty percent plaque reduction titer was determined by standard techniques (Frey et al., 2002) . Briefly, sera from immunized animals was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56°C and serial dilutions of antibodies were incubated with 50 pfu of VACV for 1 hour at 37°C. Confluent Vero cells monolayers were infected with antibody-virus mixtures for 1 hour, washed with PBS and incubated under liquid overlay for 2 days. Monolayers were then stained with 0.5% of crystal violet (Sigma) for 5 min and plaques were counted. The neutralization was calculated as the percentage of the number of plaque counts reduced in the testing serum per assay compared to the mean number of the plaque counts for the three virus controls (without sera) in the same assay.

Age matched female BALB/c mice (5 per group) were used in all experiments. Challenges were conducted two weeks after the last immunization. For IP challenge study, mice were anesthetized intramuscularly with ketamine-xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) and then injected, intraperitoneally, with 5 × 10 7 pfu of VACV-WR in 100 μl of PBS. For intranasal challenge, mice were administered 5 × 10 6 pfu VACV-WR in 25 μl of PBS by intranasal inoculation. Mice were weighed and observed daily, as previously described (Selin, Nahill, and Welsh, 1994) . Death at the end of each following challenge was recorded. All experiments were done in compliance with protocols approved by the IACUC and IBC at UMMS.

Tests were performed using Epi Info™ software for Windows available from CDC web site. Survival curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier test. Comparisons between the mean percentage body-weight changes for different groups at each day after challenge and between mean antibody titers were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test (Microsoft Excel software, version 2003) in consultation with a biostatistician. Significance levels were set at p < 0.05. Sequence analysis of the selected protective variola major and vaccinia antigens.

Journal of Immune Based Therapies and Vaccines Prospects for control of emerging infectious diseases with plasmid DNA vaccines,"Experiments almost 20 years ago demonstrated that injections of a sequence of DNA encoding part of a pathogen could stimulate immunity. It was soon realized that ""DNA vaccination"" had numerous potential advantages over conventional vaccine approaches including inherent safety and a more rapid production time. These and other attributes make DNA vaccines ideal for development against emerging pathogens. Recent advances in optimizing various aspects of DNA vaccination have accelerated this approach from concept to reality in contemporary human trials.","Throughout recorded history, infectious diseases have plagued human existence. One effective approach to limiting these diseases has been vaccination. For example, in a recent report by Roush and colleagues at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ever since the introduction of vaccines the incidence of infectious diseases like diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis A and B, Haemophilus influenza and varicella zoster has declined by more than 80% in the U.S [1] . Furthermore, after the introduction of vaccines, large scale transmission of measles, rubella, and polio has been eliminated in the U.S., while smallpox has been eradicated worldwide. However, new emerging infectious pathogens such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), SARS coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome virus), and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) viruses have adapted strategies to rapidly change their genetic compositions. As the influenza pandemic of 1918 (H1N1) killed approximately 20 to 50 million people worldwide, massive disease and death is similarly feared from newly emerging pathogens. In addition, the current novel swine derived H1N1 pandemic further exemplifies the need for a rapid and effective vaccine against emerging pathogens [2] . Thus a vaccination strategy to control emerging diseases will require a more effective and rapid response than available from conventional approaches such as live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, or protein subunit vaccines. Plasmid DNA vaccines, as reviewed in this article, may be an option to effectively combat current emerging infectious diseases.

Almost 20 years ago, Malone and Felgner at Vical Incorporated, and Wolff and colleagues at the University of Wis-consin, demonstrated that mRNA and closed loops of double-stranded DNA (plasmids) injected into muscle tissue could be taken up by cells at the administration site (transfection) resulting in the production (expression) of proteins not normally made by the host cell [3] . It was soon realized that this approach could be utilized for both gene therapy as well as vaccine applications, and thus the field of DNA vaccines was born.

Shortly after these original observations, many groups including those led by Liu and colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories [4] , Weiner and colleagues at University of Pennsylvania [5] , Johnston and colleagues at University of Texas [6] , Robinson and colleagues at University of Massachusetts [7] , and Hoffman and colleagues at Naval Medical Research Center [8] , demonstrated that immunization with DNA could result in the production of foreign proteins or antigens that stimulate the immune system resulting in protection from or amelioration of infectious diseases in animal models. Development in this area has greatly advanced over the years and human clinical trials of DNA vaccines have now been conducted against various infectious pathogens including the malaria parasite, dengue viruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebola virus, seasonal influenza viruses, avian or pandemic influenza viruses, West Nile virus (WMV), SARS coronavirus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV.

The precise mechanism of the induction of immunity after pDNA vaccination is complex [9] and multi-factorial ( Figure 1 ).

It is thought that after immunization, transfected muscle cells may produce antigen or foreign proteins that then directly stimulate B cells of the immune system, which in turn produce antibodies. Transfected muscle cells could possibly transfer the antigen to so-called antigen presenting cells (as demonstrated by cross priming) which then transport the proteins via distinct pathways (the MHC I for CD8+T cells or MHC II for CD4+T cells) that result in the display of different processed fragments of expressed proteins (antigens). Finally, direct transfection of antigen presenting cells (such as dendritic cells) with subsequent processing and display of MHC-antigen complexes may also occur. Because the process of antigen production by host cells after DNA vaccination mimics the production of antigens during a natural infection, the resulting immune response is thought to be similar to the type induced by pathogens. Indeed, DNA vaccination generates antigens in their native form and with similar structure and function to antigens generated after natural infection.

A plasmid used in DNA vaccination ( Figure 2 ) contains a gene encoding an antigen of the target pathogen (immunogen gene). Expression of the protein antigen is ""turned on"" in the host cell by a promoter, and ""turned off"" by a terminator (a polyadenylation signal sequence, generally referred to aspoly-A). Other genes such as the bacterial origin of replication sequence and an antibiotic resistance gene are incorporated for manufacturing purposes. The resulting plasmid is a stable, self-contained unit that can be manufactured by consistent and scalable bacterial fermentation and purification processes.

Production of DNA vaccines starts with E. coli cells which are transformed with the plasmid of interest. These cells are grown and stored frozen in a stock of vials called a Master Cell Bank. Growth of the E. coli is typically done via a fermentation process similar to that used in the manufacturing of certain alcoholic beverages. The recovery process then requires lysis of the cells, in order to release the plasmid retained within the E. coli cells. DNA is then purified using various chromatographic methods.

DNA vaccination has many advantages compared with conventional vaccine approaches (Appendix 1) particularly in the setting of protecting against potentially lethal emerging infectious diseases. Protecting against a particular pathogen may require immunity to more than one component of the organism and may require stimulation of different components of the host immune system. Traditionally, most preventive vaccines have relied on antibodies as the main correlate of protection, components that prevent infection or disease. However, T cells play an important role in controlling disease for established infection. Conventional vaccines based on whole pathogens typically induce immune responses against a number of irrelevant components of the organism. Subunit protein vaccines target individual components of the pathogen and usually only stimulate antibodies. DNA vaccines can accommodate a combination of different genes that code for different antigens from one or more different pathogens. This can result in the generation of broad immunity to multiple protein antigens. DNA vaccines have also been observed to stimulate both antibody and T cell arms of the immune system including those that are specialized to kill viruses or cancer cells (via cytotoxic or killer T cells). A significant advantage, especially for emerging pathogens, is that DNA vaccines do not require the handling of potentially deadly infectious agents. In addition they have a significantly shorter production time, something paramounrt with an ongoing pandemic.

Overall, a well-tolerated safety profile has been observed in human clinical trials of DNA vaccination [10] . Early in the development, there were numerous theoretical safety concerns regarding DNA vaccines. In particular, there were concerns about the fate of the injected genes and the potential for insertion into the host DNA possibly result- ing in the uncontrolled stimulation of other genes such as those that may cause cancer. These concerns have dissipated over the years based on thousands of human subjects who have undergone DNA vaccination or plasmidbased gene therapy. Furthermore, in pre-clinical safety studies in animals, the potential for plasmid integration into the host genome has been shown to be negligible and several orders of magnitude below the spontaneous mutation rate that occurs naturally in mammalian genes [11] . There were also early concerns regarding the induction of autoimmune reactions, as DNA may be considered as a self antigen to the host. Increased rates of autoimmunity or anti-DNA antibodies such as those observed in Systemic Lupus Erythematosis have not been observed in clinical trials of DNA vaccination [12] . Interestingly, as plasmid DNA vaccines are noninfectious, significant immune responses are not developed against the plasmid itself. Therefore only specific immune responses to the expressed antigen are stimulated with this approach. In contrast, with viral vectors such as adenoviruses, pre-existing and post vaccination immunity to the vector itself can be generated thereby limiting the pathogen specific immune response In contrast, DNA vaccination can be repeated without diminishing the specific immune response. This may be a pertinent beneficial aspect of DNA immunization, particularly in light of recent clinical trials in humans using viral vector-based vaccines, such as the common cold adenovirus, where immunity to the vector itself has been raised as a potential safety issue [13, 14] . In summary, the potential risks of DNA vaccines appear to be minimal based on safety data from human clinical trials in thousands of subjects.

Over the years, much progress has been made in optimizing DNA vaccine immunogenicity. Recent progress has targeted many different aspects of DNA vaccination which has successfully resulted in improved immune responses (Appendix 2).

With regard to the plasmid itself, significant advances have been made in optimizing the genetic sequence of the encoding gene as well as other related components. Coadministration of the plasmid that encodes the pathogen along with other genes that encode for immune stimulating substances such as cytokines or chemokines has also been used to further enhance the immune response of certain DNA vaccines [15] .

In some cases, once various components of the plasmid have been optimized, the encoded protein may be sufficiently immunogenic without the need for additional components (unformulated or ""naked"" DNA) such as adjuvants. One of the earliest trials in humans of an unformulated or ""naked"" DNA vaccine was one that targeted the malaria parasite. Wang and colleagues at the Naval Medical Research Institute immunized 20 subjects with a plasmid that encoded naturally occurring forms of malaria proteins [16] . In this trial, more than half of the subjects were shown to have cells that can kill or lyse malaria infected cells (cytotoxic T cell or killer cells). In a more recent clinical trial, a DNA vaccine optimized for human expression and encoding modified forms of West Nile Virus proteins was studied by Martin and colleagues at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and demonstrated that the vaccine stimulated antibodies that inhibited the virus (neutralizing antibodies) in all individuals receiving the vaccination regimen [17] . This unformulated DNA vaccine appears to induce a similar level of immune responses to those observed in vaccinated horses protected from WNV. In addition, a recent clinical trial by these same NIH researchers tested an optimized but unformulated DNA vaccine for SARS coronavirus and demonstrated neutralizing antibodies in all subjects who received three doses of the vaccine [18] .

Another area of research to enhance the immune response to DNA vaccines is related to the route of administration. Although intramuscular injection is the predominant route of vaccine delivery, other routes of administration have also been studied such as intradermal delivery. It is conceivable that intradermal delivery, which is a more superficial injection, may result in better transfection of antigen presenting cells, particularly a type of cell called dendritic cells.

The mode of delivery may also be a pertinent factor in eliciting the proper immune response after DNA immunization.

Needle and syringe is the predominant method to deliver both DNA vaccines as well as conventional vaccines. However, Roy and colleagues at PowderMed (now Pfizer Incorporated) have used DNA precipitated onto gold particles which are driven into to skin with a blast of pressurized gas, and called this approach ""particle-mediated epidermal delivery"" (PMED). In one clinical study by Roy and collaborators using PMED, individuals exhibited potent antibody responses to a hepatitis B DNA vaccine [19] . In another study, Drape and colleagues at Pow-derMed also observed strong antibody responses to the influenza virus DNA vaccine with the PMED approach [20] .

Another approach for the delivery of DNA vaccines is the use of needle-free devices. Needle-free injection of DNA vaccines has been utilized in numerous clinical studies and appears to be well-tolerated and may have some advantages of further augmenting the immune response to DNA vaccination. For example, Nabel and colleagues at the NIH injected individuals intramuscularly with a sixplasmid unformulated DNA vaccine for HIV (Env A, Env B, Env C, subtype B gag, Pol, and Nef) with the needle-free device (Biojector ® 2000) and observed HIV specific T-cell immune responses in over 75% of individuals [21] . Similarly, this same group at the NIH completed a recent study of an Ebola DNA vaccine also using this same needle-free device. They demonstrated that Ebola-specific antibody and CD4+ T-cell immune responses were elicited in all individuals who received the three-dose vaccination regimen [22] .

Another novel mode of enhancing DNA vaccines has been a more invasive technique called electroporation. This method involves administration of brief electrical pulses of various voltages, after injection of a DNA vaccine, in order to enhance the uptake of DNA, presumably through the formation of transient pores in the muscle cell membrane. Many groups have shown encouraging results using electroporation in animals. One of the first groups to use this technique, Ulmer and colleagues, at Chiron Corporation, demonstrated that antibody and T-cell responses to the HIV protein Gag encoded in a DNA vaccine were enhanced by electroporation in rhesus macaques [23] . More recently, studies by Pavlakis and colleagues at the NIH have also noted that DNA potency measured by T-cell responses to the HIV protein Gag was augmented in nonhuman primates using electroporation [24] . Although encouraging in the strong magnitude of responses generated in animals, the wide clinical applicability of electroporation in humans in relation to tolerability remains to be determined. Some researchers have used plasmid DNA in what has been called a heterologous ""prime-boost"" vaccination approach. This method involves delivery of one or more plasmid DNA vaccine priming doses followed by a boost with a viral vector (such as adenovirus) which codes for the same antigens. In the prime-boost setting, DNA vaccination plays an important role in priming different types of T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells) specific for various proteins. In studies, for example, by Nabel and colleagues at the NIH, DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding HIV antigens followed by a boost with an adenoviral vector carrying the same HIV gene sequences, resulted in stronger T-cell responses compared with adenoviral vector or DNA vaccine alone [25] . Similarly, Pantaleo and colleagues at the University of Lausanne have shown that a DNA vaccine for HIV followed by a boost with a poxvirus vector (NYVAC) resulted in stronger immune responses compared to immunization with pox vector alone [26] . In another prime-boost study, Jacobson and colleagues, at the University of California at San Francisco, immunized subjects with a DNA vaccine for CMV who were then boosted with a live-attenuated CMV virus (Towne strain). Faster and stronger virus-specific T-cell responses were observed in the group of subjects that received the DNA and Towne strain compared with a group of subjects that received the Towne strain alone [27] .

An area of potentially paramount importance for DNA vaccines is formulations and adjuvants. Adjuvants are common to most licensed vaccines and are included to potentiate the immune responses elicited by vaccination. For DNA vaccines, various delivery systems and adjuvants have been tested. One of the earliest promising adjuvants for plasmid DNA vaccines was poly-lactide coglycolide (PLG), cationic microparticles. Ulmer and colleagues at Chiron Corporation evaluated HIV DNA vaccines formulated with PLG microparticles and found strong antibody and T-cell responses in macaques [28] . Poloxamers represent another class of adjuvants tested with DNA vaccines. Some poloxamers are nonionic block copolymers, and when combined with a cationic surfactant, bond with DNA to form small particles. A study by Wloch and colleagues at Vical Incorporated examined DNA immunizations of human volunteers with cytomegalovirus (CMV) plasmids formulated with a specific poloxamer adjuvant. In that study CMV-specific T-cell responses were detected in a majority of CMV sero-negative individuals who were vaccinated [29] . Vaxfectin ® is another example of a delivery system and adjuvant for DNA vaccines that has been recently tested in humans. Vaxfectin ® is a cationic lipid-based adjuvant that bears a positive charge that binds electrostatically to negatively charged DNA. Studies in animals also demonstrated that Vaxfectin ® -adjuvanted DNA vaccines can be protective against lethal viral challenges. For example, Webby and colleagues at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Vical Incorporated, immunized ferrets with three plasmids containing DNA components of the H5N1 pandemic influenza virus formulated with Vaxfectin ® [30] . After one or two immunizations, all animals were completely protected from lethal pandemic influenza virus challenge, while unvaccinated control animals died. Similarly, Griffin and colleagues at Johns Hopkins immunized juvenile and infant rhesus macaques by intramuscular and intradermal routes with measles antigen encoding plasmids formulated with Vaxfectin ® [31] . All of the vaccinated monkeys developed strong and durable neutralizing antibodies and they were challenged with high doses of measles virus after one year. All of the unvaccinated control animals developed viremia and became ill with rashes in contrast to the vaccinated ani-mals which remained healthy and had no detectable virus levels. Lastly, the first human clinical trial of a DNA vaccine formulated with Vaxfectin ® has been completed with plasmids that encode pandemic influenza virus antigens (H5N1). The preliminary results reported from this trial by Smith and colleagues at Vical Incorporated suggest that vaccination with H5 DNA plasmids formulated with this adjuvant were well-tolerated and stimulated strong H5 antibody responses in up to 67% of subjects [32] . Notably, the antibody response rate and safety profile observed in this trial are comparable to most conventional proteinbased vaccines for pandemic influenza.

Although DNA vaccines have yet to be approved for human use, three have already been approved for animal health.

As noted in Appendix 3, the first DNA vaccine approved for animal health was one that protected horses against WNV. WNV is a mosquito-borne virus, which causes encephalitis or inflammation in the brain of infected animals and humans. Prior to approval of a vaccine, approximately one-third of the horses infected with WNV would die or be euthanized. The WNV DNA vaccine, developed by Fort Dodge Laboratories, was approved by the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2005 after the demonstration of safety and efficacy [33] .

A DNA vaccine has also been recently approved to prevent a fatal viral disease that afflicts salmon, called infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. In mid-2001, an epidemic occurred in Atlantic salmon killing up to 90% of the fish. Scientists at Aqua Health, a unit of Novartis in Canada, conducted a field trial by immunizing millions of salmons with a single dose of DNA vaccine encoding for a protein of the virus [34] . The vaccine was approved in 2005 based on the results of this trial that demonstrated that the vaccine, called Apex-IHN, protected the fish from death without adverse effects.

Additionally, a therapeutic DNA vaccine designed to treat dogs with skin cancer (melanoma) was granted conditional approval in 2007. This vaccine was developed through a collaboration of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Merial Ltd. Canine melanoma is an aggressive form of cancer. Dogs with melanomas that have gone beyond initial stages typically have a lifespan of one to five months with conventional therapies. In addition, the cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy. In a study of the DNA vaccine conducted by MSKCC, many dogs who received the vaccinations lived beyond the average 13 month survival [35] . Based on the significantly extended survival, the USDA gave this DNA vaccine conditional approval in 2007. This is the first therapeutic vaccine approved by the U.S. government for the treatment of cancer in animals or humans.

Perhaps most relevant to emerging infectious diseases, DNA vaccines have the distinct advantage of a rapid development time, are non-infectious, and have a well-defined manufacturing process. DNA vaccines contain no infectious components and can be produced safely without the handling of hazardous infectious agents. Furthermore, there is a well-defined analytical process for the manufacturing of all DNA vaccines, which is universally applicable to any DNA vaccine.

Vaccination is an important component of a response to potential pandemics such as avian influenza. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since November 2003, approximately 400 cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) have been reported worldwide [36] . Pandemic (H5N1) influenza virus has evolved into at least 10 distinct clades or subclades. As noted earlier, the emergence of triple-reassortment swine influenza with limited cross reactivity antibody responses after vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines suggests the need to rapidly produce new vaccines to this particular emerging virus [37] . The manufacturing time of conventional protein-based vaccines may be excessive, as they typically require growth in egg or cell cultures, which involve a relatively slow production time. DNA vaccines, in contrast, have estimated vaccine production times that can be months earlier, as only the DNA sequence is required and the manufacturing process is standard (Figure 3 ) [38] . DNA vaccines therefore have a unique advantage of large scale production for human use in a relatively streamlined period of time. In the case of potentially fatal emerging pathogens, reducing the production time of an effective vaccine may be critical in preventing spread of infection and death.

In summary, based on recent advances in enhancing protective immune responses and a well-tolerated safety profile in humans, plasmid DNA vaccines have the potential to become an integral part of the arsenal dedicated to enhancing human health by preventing diseases through immunization in our ever changing microbial environment.

vaccines Cytolytic Perforin as an Adjuvant to Enhance the Immunogenicity of DNA Vaccines,"DNA vaccines present one of the most cost-effective platforms to develop global vaccines, which have been tested for nearly three decades in preclinical and clinical settings with some success in the clinic. However, one of the major challenges for the development of DNA vaccines is their poor immunogenicity in humans, which has led to refinements in DNA delivery, dosage in prime/boost regimens and the inclusion of adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity. In this review, we focus on adjuvants that can enhance the immunogenicity of DNA encoded antigens and highlight the development of a novel cytolytic DNA platform encoding a truncated mouse perforin. The application of this innovative DNA technology has considerable potential in the development of effective vaccines.","Vaccines represent an effective strategy in the fight against infectious diseases and recent estimates suggest that vaccination prevents 2-3 million deaths every year [1] . The need for rapid and large scale vaccine production during epidemics against emerging pathogens is a major challenge in vaccine development [2] , including effective vaccines for antigenically diverse and versatile pathogens that successfully subvert host immunity such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and malaria [3] [4] [5] .

DNA vaccines can overcome some of these challenges, as it is relatively easy to produce large number of doses within a short period of time, and they are stable at ambient temperature and do not require cold chain transportation. They are also consistent between lots and have an excellent safety profile allowing for safety evaluations by regulatory authorities and distribution in a large scale [6, 7] . Importantly, DNA vaccines can induce both humoral and cell-mediated responses in the vaccinated host [8] [9] [10] . Although they are safe and well tolerated, they are often poorly immunogenic and inefficacious in humans [11] . Therefore, recent studies on the advancements of DNA vaccines are focused on effective delivery and increasing the immunogenicity of the encoded antigen/s of interest [12, 13] .

Effective immunization with DNA vaccines requires efficient transfection of host cells which is highly dependent on the delivery route and use of devices. Conventional delivery routes to introduce the DNA vaccine include intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous and oral routes [12] . The preferred delivery route depends on the requirement to activate specific immune cells. The skin is rich in immune cells including local dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and is therefore likely to be a more favorable site for vaccine delivery [14, 15] . Attempts to improve DNA delivery have been made through other physical methods with the use of 'gene guns' or electroporation, which transiently permeabilizes the cell membrane to efficiently transfer the DNA resulting in increased vaccine uptake by skin and muscle cells [16] . Although these methods have shown to increase DNA uptake [17, 18] , they require optimization to achieve increased efficiency and acceptance for clinical use. An alternative approach to improve transfection efficiency includes formulation of DNA with liposomes or nanoparticles [19] . Liposomal delivery can be affected by pre-systemic (epithelial) and systemic barriers (enzymatic degradation, binding, and opsonization) [20] . Encapsulation of DNA with nanoparticles has been reported to increase DNA uptake or transfection efficiency [21, 22] . Some of the challenges in the use of nanoparticles with DNA include encapsulation inefficiency, endocytosis by target cells and toxicity [23] . The use of genetic adjuvants is one approach to enhance the immunogenicity of the antigen and can be used to complement other strategies (e.g., DNA delivery) also designed to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Upon immunization with a DNA vaccine, the target cells uptake DNA by endocytosis [24] and the transfected cells express the DNA-encoded protein antigen(s). When antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are directly transfected, the intracellular proteins are processed and immunogenic epitopes are then presented by MHC Class I molecules, which can directly stimulate naïve CD8 + T cells [12, 25] . The protein immunogen released from transfected cells can be endocytosed and/or phagocytosed by other APCs and are presented by MHC class II molecules to activate naive CD4 + T cells [25, 26] . If the proteins are expressed by stromal cells like keratinocytes, APCs can also indirectly capture secreted antigens and cross-present by MHC Class I molecules to further stimulate CD8 + T cells [27] . After DNA vaccination, CD8 + T cells specific to the vaccine antigen undergo expansion, acquire effector functions and differentiates into memory CD8 + T cells [28, 29] . The memory cells differentiate into effector memory T cells upon re-exposure to the antigen [29, 30] . The ability of a DNA vaccine to elicit T cell immunity is thus dependent on activating APCs to present antigen: MHC complexes to T cells [31] and adjuvants can serve as an important costimulatory factor to enhance this process.

In this brief review, based on our experience, we discuss the progress in the development of DNA vaccines, approaches to improve delivery and genetic adjuvants used to enhance immunogenicity. We focus on an innovative cytolytic DNA technology developed and patented in our laboratory.

The immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is enhanced by CpG motifs present in the plasmid backbone, which can activate APC via toll like receptors (TLR9) [32] [33] [34] . Unmethylated CpG motifs have been reported to induce B cell proliferation and secretion of immunoglobulin in vitro and in vivo [33] . Activation of macrophages and DCs results in upregulation of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules, and secretion of cytokines (IL-12 and IL-18) involved in helper T cells (Th1) response [34] . Thus, CpG motifs in DNA plasmids serve as a 'natural adjuvant' for DNA vaccines. Plasmid DNA can be designed to encode additional adjuvants with the antigen(s) of interest. Molecular adjuvants such as fusion proteins including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) have been developed and used to enhance vaccine immunogenicity [35] [36] [37] . The gene encoding such proteins as adjuvants is either fused with the gene encoding the vaccine antigen to produce a fusion protein driven by a same promoter or as separate proteins driven by different promoters in the same or different plasmid. Co-encoding of genes creates a suitable cellular micro environment such as sustained antigen release and/or upregulation of cytokines, enhancing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines [38] .

A majority of the studies on experimental DNA vaccines with genetic adjuvants have been studied in animal models such as mice (Table 1) , and very few of these have been clinically tested ( Table 2) . Limited published data on clinical trials pose difficulty to compare efficacy between adjuvants in animals and humans. 

Different cytokines, such as interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12), chemokines, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86), and signaling molecules (Interferon regulatory factor -3) have been used as genetic adjuvants with DNA vaccines [39, 40, [42] [43] [44] 48, 68] . Genes expressing IFN-γ IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 have been used to stimulate Th1 responses [44, 45, 70] , and IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, for Th2 stimulation [42, 43, [71] [72] [73] . The inclusion of genes encoding cytokines, like IL-2 or IL-12, as adjuvants for HIV-1 DNA vaccines is known to increase cell mediated immunity (CMI) [74, 75] . However, a bicistronic HIV DNA encoding gp120 and IL-2 elicited weaker specific immune response than monocistronic HIV-1 gp120 DNA [76] . Combinations of genetic adjuvants like IL-2 and IL-15 with HIV-1 DNA vaccine have also been used but no synergistic effect on the level of total antibody to HIV-1 antigen was reported [77] . A phase I/IIa trial showed that coadministration of DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) with GM-CSF elicited PAP-specific CD4 + and/or CD8 + T cell responses [68] . However, GM-CSF was administered as a recombinant protein.

HSP70, a class of molecular chaperone, is known to induce maturation of DCs and activation of the Th1 pathway [78] [79] [80] . A fusion vaccine for multiple myeloma termed hDKK1-hHSP70 was shown to be effective in inhibiting the targeted tumor and increased survival of vaccinated mice by eliciting tumor-specific humoral and cellular immune responses [80] . However, a DNA vaccine encoding HPV16E7 fused with HSP70, targeting HPV16 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 failed to enhance significant T cell responses in a Phase I clinical trial [69] . A bicistronic DNA encoding HSP70 as a membrane bound or secreted protein has been used to improve the immunogenicity of a HIV Gag [60] . In this case, HSP70 expression was driven by a weaker SV40 promoter and HIV Gag by a stronger CMV promoter. Such a vaccine design enhanced Gag-specific T cell responses, providing greater protection in mice challenged with EcoHIV [60] . EcoHIV is a chimeric virus containing the envelope protein gp 80 of mouse leukemia virus rather than HIV gp 120 that can replicate in mouse leukocytes in vivo, thus representing a viable mouse challenge model for early assessment of HIV vaccines [81] . The proposed mechanism of HSP70 as an adjuvant is that TLR 2/4 on DCs interacts with secreted or bound HSP70, further attracting DCs to the site of antigen expression. This is followed by DC maturation, presentation of antigens by MHC molecules and secretion of cytokines and costimulatory molecules [82] , thus enhancing T cell immune responses against the vaccine antigen. 

A chimeric version of the oligomerization domain from the chicken complement inhibitor (C4bp) was used to produce an oligomeric form of vaccine antigens [35, 83] . This protein, termed IMX313, forms a heptameric structure of the vaccine protein. This has been used to develop DNA vaccines for tuberculosis, malaria and HIV to enhance humoral and/or cellular responses [35, 36, 84] . Vaccination with a DNA vaccine encoding secreted HIV Tat (TPA-Tat IMX313) induced higher humoral and cellular responses and improved protection against EcoHIV challenge in mice [36] . A phase I clinical trial of tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A-IMX313 evaluated the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic, but cellular (Ag85A-specific IFN- [81] . The proposed mechanism of HSP70 as an adjuvant is that TLR 2/4 on DCs interacts eted or bound HSP70, further attracting DCs to the site of antigen expression. This is by DC maturation, presentation of antigens by MHC molecules and secretion of cytokines mulatory molecules [82] , thus enhancing T cell immune responses against the vaccine en Complement Inhibitor imeric version of the oligomerization domain from the chicken complement inhibitor as used to produce an oligomeric form of vaccine antigens [35, 83] . This protein, termed forms a heptameric structure of the vaccine protein. This has been used to develop DNA for tuberculosis, malaria and HIV to enhance humoral and/or cellular responses [35, 36, 84] . on with a DNA vaccine encoding secreted HIV Tat (TPA-Tat IMX313) induced higher and cellular responses and improved protection against EcoHIV challenge in mice [36] . A inical trial of tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A-IMX313 evaluated the vaccine to be safe and enic, but cellular (Ag85A-specific IFN-Ƴ ) and humoral (MVA-specific IgG) responses were ficant [85] . Thus, the ability of such an adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity of DNA n humans is still debated.

G is a type III viral fusion envelope protein, which mediates fusion of the virus envelope ost cell membrane [86] . The use of fusogenic membrane glycoprotein (FMG) gene from VSV vaccine encoding the H7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 was shown to enhance ell responses and effectively control growth of tumors [87] . The VSV G protein was also induce a T-response at low doses or a T-independent response at higher doses [88] . FMG s into large multinucleated syncytia, which are then killed by a nonapoptotic mechanism ytiosomes are released from the membrane and present antigens efficiently to DCs [90] . thus act as an adjuvant for any antigen expressed by a DNA vaccine. Vaccination of mice hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) together with VSVG resulted in frequency of IFN-γ, but not TNF-α-or IL-2-producing CD3+ CD44+ CD8+ effector memory lls [57] . This DNA vaccine was constructed in a bicistronic vector with VSVG co-encoded e plasmid with HCV NS3. VSVG expression was driven by a weaker SV40 promoter and stronger CMV promoter [57] . However, others have also reported an increase in the specific n the immunogen and VSVG were expressed from different plasmids [37, 87] .

tic Protein rin (PRF) is a pore forming protein released by immune cells including NK cells and T lymphocytes (CTL) [91] . The 67-kilodalton PRF protein oligomerizes to form pores that channel to release granzyme into the cytosol of target cells [92] . Suicide genes inducing of target cells have been used for cancer therapies, and the role of apoptotic cell death in n, whether immune-stimulatory or immune-suppressive, is debated [93] . Recently, a novel hnology has been developed--termed cytolytic DNA technology-in which a truncated F is incorporated in a bicistronic DNA vector to act as a vaccine adjuvant [55] [56] [57] 94] .

lytic DNA vaccines are based on a bicistronic DNA plasmid constructed on a pVax (Invitrogen) with a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a Simian Virus (SV40) promoter gene encoding the protein of interest as an immunogen is inserted downstream of the CMV and the gene encoding a truncated version of mouse PRF downstream of the SV40 promoter . The SV40 is a weaker promoter compared to CMV and has been shown to result in 10-fold tein expression in transfected HEK293T cells in vitro [55, 95] .

) and humoral (MVA-specific IgG) responses were not significant [85] . Thus, the ability of such an adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in humans is still debated.

VSV G is a type III viral fusion envelope protein, which mediates fusion of the virus envelope and the host cell membrane [86] . The use of fusogenic membrane glycoprotein (FMG) gene from VSV in a DNA vaccine encoding the H7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 was shown to enhance CD8 + T cell responses and effectively control growth of tumors [87] . The VSV G protein was also shown to induce a T-response at low doses or a T-independent response at higher doses [88] . FMG fuses cells into large multinucleated syncytia, which are then killed by a nonapoptotic mechanism [89] . Syncytiosomes are released from the membrane and present antigens efficiently to DCs [90] . FMGs can thus act as an adjuvant for any antigen expressed by a DNA vaccine. Vaccination of mice with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) together with VSVG resulted in increased frequency of IFN-γ, but not TNF-α-or IL-2-producing CD3+ CD44+ CD8+ effector memory T (T EM ) cells [57] . This DNA vaccine was constructed in a bicistronic vector with VSVG co-encoded in the same plasmid with HCV NS3. VSVG expression was driven by a weaker SV40 promoter and NS3 by a stronger CMV promoter [57] . However, others have also reported an increase in the specific CMI when the immunogen and VSVG were expressed from different plasmids [37, 87] .

Perforin (PRF) is a pore forming protein released by immune cells including NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) [91] . The 67-kilodalton PRF protein oligomerizes to form pores that serve as a channel to release granzyme into the cytosol of target cells [92] . Suicide genes inducing apoptosis of target cells have been used for cancer therapies, and the role of apoptotic cell death in vaccination, whether immune-stimulatory or immune-suppressive, is debated [93] . Recently, a novel DNA technology has been developed--termed cytolytic DNA technology-in which a truncated mouse PRF is incorporated in a bicistronic DNA vector to act as a vaccine adjuvant [55] [56] [57] 94] .

Cytolytic DNA vaccines are based on a bicistronic DNA plasmid constructed on a pVax backbone (Invitrogen) with a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a Simian Virus (SV40) promoter [55] . The gene encoding the protein of interest as an immunogen is inserted downstream of the CMV promoter and the gene encoding a truncated version of mouse PRF downstream of the SV40 promoter ( Figure 1) . The SV40 is a weaker promoter compared to CMV and has been shown to result in 10-fold lower protein expression in transfected HEK293T cells in vitro [55, 95] . The PRF gene was modified to express a truncated version of PRF (~60KDa) lacking the final 12 amino acid residues of the C terminus (unstructured region of PRF) [56, 57, 94] in order for PRF to become cytolytic [96] . The final 12 C-terminal amino acids are required to export PRF protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, from where glycosylated PRF is then transported to The PRF gene was modified to express a truncated version of PRF (~60KDa) lacking the final 12 amino acid residues of the C terminus (unstructured region of PRF) [56, 57, 94] in order for PRF to become cytolytic [96] . The final 12 C-terminal amino acids are required to export PRF protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, from where glycosylated PRF is then transported to secretory granules [96] . Removal of the C-terminal abrogates the export of PRF from the ER and its subsequent accumulation in the ER is cytotoxic to the host cell [96, 97] .

Different recombinant cytolytic DNA-PRF vaccines (rDNA-PRF) have been shown to elicit immune responses higher than those elicited by canonical DNA vaccines (without PRF) and the mechanism underlying this has been established [94] . A previous study showed that coexpression of HCV NS3 and PRF elicited nonapoptotic cell death in transfected cells, whilst immunization with NS3-PRF DNA vaccine increased NS3-specific T cell mediated responses as evidenced by increased NS3-specific IFN-γ responses in an ELISpot assay and increased numbers of polyfunctional CD8 + T EM cells that simultaneously secreted IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α [56] . Cytolytic DNA platform where the expression of immunogen is driven by a stronger promoter allows for sufficient antigen expression and accumulation within the target cells followed by nonapoptotic cell death due to lesser expression of PRF driven by a weaker SV40 promoter; thus, balancing the level of antigen expression with the timing of cell death [94] .

Necrosis is considered as the mechanism of cell death by PRF as evidenced by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and low caspase activity [55, 56, 94] . LDH release occurs after the rupture of cell membrane during secondary necrosis [98, 99] . In contrast, LDH was not released by cells treated with doxorubicin (a proapoptotic drug) or cells transfected with NS3 wild type PRF or NS3 12del483A PRF (mutant and nontoxic PRF) [94] . Expression of PRF from a cytolytic DNA, e.g., NS3 PRF vaccine, thus results in necrotic cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein-1 kinase activity, as evidenced by detection of uncleaved cytokeratin 18 in Huh-7 cells [56] . Necrosis releases damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which in turn activate DCs to migrate to the site of vaccination [100, 101] .

When purified DCs including the CD8α + subset from naïve C57BL/6 mice were exposed to HEK293T cells (transfected with Ovalbumin-PRF), it resulted in upregulation of costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86), indicating maturation of the immune cells with the cytolytic DNA [94] . A significant increase in CD11c + DCs and cross-presenting CD8a + DCs, and upregulation of CD80 has been reported in mice vaccinated with a cytolytic DNA HIV 1 Gag PRF compared to a canonical DNA vaccine [55] . Local and migrated DCs at the site of inflammation can take up antigens by endocytosis and are also exposed to DAMPs. Activated and matured DCs can then prime naïve CD8 + T cells (Figure 2) . Antigen cross-presentation by DCs to CD8 + T cells has been shown to increase the number of proliferating CD8 + T cells by~2-fold with cytolytic DNA compared to the noncytolytic PRF DNA [94] . Thus, a cytolytic DNA vaccine has an inbuilt adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine immunogen. Whereas, the immunogenicity of canonical DNA vaccines mostly depends on direct transfection of DCs and to a lesser extent cross-presentation of antigens shed from transfected cells and/or derived from transfected cells that have undergone spontaneous cell death [94] .

Several studies have established that DCs exposed to necrotic or lytic cells expressing antigens mature and cross-present more efficiently than DCs exposed to antigens derived from a cellular milieu that comprise of apoptotic cells [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . Comparative studies evaluating the ability of proapoptotic (e.g., rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) and diphtheria toxin subunit A (DTa)) and necrotic proteins (e.g., truncated PRF) to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA when encoded in plasmid DNA vaccines showed that truncated PRF is the most effective for this purpose [55] [56] [57] . However, a caveat is that vaccine-encoded antigens need to accumulate significantly inside the cell before necrosis occurs following expression of truncated PRF in order to activate DCs to cross-present vaccine-encoded antigens [55, 94] . Several studies have established that DCs exposed to necrotic or lytic cells expressing antigens mature and cross-present more efficiently than DCs exposed to antigens derived from a cellular milieu that comprise of apoptotic cells [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . Comparative studies evaluating the ability of proapoptotic (e.g., rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) and diphtheria toxin subunit A (DTa)) and necrotic proteins (e.g., truncated PRF) to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA when encoded in plasmid DNA vaccines showed that truncated PRF is the most effective for this purpose [55] [56] [57] . However, a caveat is that vaccine-encoded antigens need to accumulate significantly inside the cell before necrosis occurs following expression of truncated PRF in order to activate DCs to cross-present vaccine-encoded antigens [55, 94] .

rDNA-PRF technology has been used in the development of HIV and HCV DNA vaccines [55, 57, 107] . Direct comparison of the effects of the cytolytic PRF and the apoptotic protein DTa on the immunogenicity of the HIV-1 Gag protein showed that PRF activated DCs more efficiently, as evidenced by the increase in frequency of cross-presenting DCs and upregulation of activation marker (CD80) [55] . In both DNA vaccines, PRF and DTa were driven by SV40 promoter. Immunization of mice with a DNA vaccine encoding proapoptotic DTa as an adjuvant in a HIV Gag DTa vaccine resulted in decreased DC activation, suggesting that DTa-induced apoptosis attenuated immune response [55] . Furthermore, improved protection in the mouse EcoHIV challenge model was achieved with rDNA-PRF encoding HIV Gag compared to protection levels in mice vaccinated with a canonical Gag DNA vaccine [57] . A rDNA-PRF vaccine encoding the HCV NS3 protein coexpressed with PRF was shown to increase NS3-specific CMI in mice and pigs, compared to NS3 coexpression with a proapoptotic protein, the rotavirus NSP4 protein [56] . NSP4 is an enterotoxin that elicits a proapoptotic effect by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane and activating caspase-3, -8, and -9 [108, 109] . This study showed that PRF coexpression induced cell death by necrosis, and thus enhanced NS3-specific immune responses, whereas, proapoptotic NSP4 reduced NS3-specific response [56] . Importantly, HCV NS3 PRF was more immunogenic than the canonical NS3 vaccine in pigs, demonstrating the translational potential of the cytolytic DNA vaccines in human clinical trials [56] . Likewise, we have shown that a multi-antigenic HCV DNA vaccine encoding genotype 3a proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5B coexpressed with PRF induced robust CMI against the range of HCV NS proteins, compared to coexpression with VSVG [57] . We also showed that multi-antigenic and multigenotypic (HCV genotype 1 and 3a) DNA cocktail vaccines encoding PRF can significantly increase the magnitude and breadth of CMI responses to NS3 and NS5B against both genotypes compared to those elicited by a single-genotype vaccine [107] . 

rDNA-PRF technology has been used in the development of HIV and HCV DNA vaccines [55, 57, 107] . Direct comparison of the effects of the cytolytic PRF and the apoptotic protein DTa on the immunogenicity of the HIV-1 Gag protein showed that PRF activated DCs more efficiently, as evidenced by the increase in frequency of cross-presenting DCs and upregulation of activation marker (CD80) [55] . In both DNA vaccines, PRF and DTa were driven by SV40 promoter. Immunization of mice with a DNA vaccine encoding proapoptotic DTa as an adjuvant in a HIV Gag DTa vaccine resulted in decreased DC activation, suggesting that DTa-induced apoptosis attenuated immune response [55] . Furthermore, improved protection in the mouse EcoHIV challenge model was achieved with rDNA-PRF encoding HIV Gag compared to protection levels in mice vaccinated with a canonical Gag DNA vaccine [57] . A rDNA-PRF vaccine encoding the HCV NS3 protein coexpressed with PRF was shown to increase NS3-specific CMI in mice and pigs, compared to NS3 coexpression with a proapoptotic protein, the rotavirus NSP4 protein [56] . NSP4 is an enterotoxin that elicits a proapoptotic effect by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane and activating caspase-3, -8, and -9 [108, 109] . This study showed that PRF coexpression induced cell death by necrosis, and thus enhanced NS3-specific immune responses, whereas, proapoptotic NSP4 reduced NS3-specific response [56] . Importantly, HCV NS3 PRF was more immunogenic than the canonical NS3 vaccine in pigs, demonstrating the translational potential of the cytolytic DNA vaccines in human clinical trials [56] . Likewise, we have shown that a multi-antigenic HCV DNA vaccine encoding genotype 3a proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5B coexpressed with PRF induced robust CMI against the range of HCV NS proteins, compared to coexpression with VSVG [57] . We also showed that multi-antigenic and multigenotypic (HCV genotype 1 and 3a) DNA cocktail vaccines encoding PRF can significantly increase the magnitude and breadth of CMI responses to NS3 and NS5B against both genotypes compared to those elicited by a single-genotype vaccine [107] .

DNA vaccines are still a promising option in the development of novel vaccination strategies. Although they have many advantages, the ability to induce effective immune responses in humans required for protection has been challenging. These challenges include ineffective delivery and poor uptake of DNA. Consequently, a recent focus has been in the development of delivery methods and/or inclusion of genetic adjuvants. Such genetic adjuvants are generally coexpressed with the antigen of interest or delivered through different plasmids. In the quest to develop and identify effective genetic adjuvants, a range of adjuvants was tested (HSP70, VSVG, IMX313, DTa, and PRF) and a novel and promising cytolytic DNA vaccine strategy has been developed. This cytolytic DNA vaccine is unique as it is based on a bicistronic plasmid with the ability to coexpress antigen and PRF in a balanced mechanism causing necrosis of vaccine-transduced cells, followed by increased activation of immune cells and cross presentation of vaccine immunogen. Cytolytic DNA vaccines encoding nonstructural proteins of HCV have been tested to enhance immunogenicity of vaccine antigen in mice [57, 107] and in a large preclinical animal model, the pig [56] . Likewise, increased immunogenicity and improved protection against EcoHIV challenge in mice with HIV Gag PRF [60] demonstrate the effectiveness of cytolytic DNA vaccines.

Adjuvants that provide effective costimulation for immune responses with specific immunogens may not have a similar effect with other immunogens, and therefore these need to be tested for their efficacy. Use of a genetic adjuvant such as PRF produces a suitable microenvironment for multiple/different immunogens and thus improves the delivery, immunogenicity and effectiveness of DNA vaccines. This strategy has considerable potential in the development of DNA-based vaccines against a range of infectious agents.

vaccines Replicon RNA Viral Vectors as Vaccines,"Single-stranded RNA viruses of both positive and negative polarity have been used as vectors for vaccine development. In this context, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles virus and rhabdoviruses have been engineered for expression of surface protein genes and antigens. Administration of replicon RNA vectors has resulted in strong immune responses and generation of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models. Immunization of mice, chicken, pigs and primates with virus-like particles, naked RNA or layered DNA/RNA plasmids has provided protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious agents and administered tumor cells. Both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy has been achieved in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, recombinant particles and replicon RNAs have been encapsulated by liposomes to improve delivery and targeting. Replicon RNA vectors have also been subjected to clinical trials. Overall, immunization with self-replicating RNA viruses provides high transient expression levels of antigens resulting in generation of neutralizing antibody responses and protection against lethal challenges under safe conditions. Vaccines 2016, 4, 39 2 of 23","Vaccine development against infectious diseases has classically been based on live attenuated or inactivated infectious agents [1] . Recently, the approach of vaccination with recombinantly expressed antigens and immunogens from viral and non-viral delivery systems has been introduced to the repertoire [2, 3] . In this context, immunization with surface proteins and antigens has elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses and vaccinated animals showed protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious agents or tumor cells [4] .

The types of non-viral vectors applied include liposomes [5] , immunostimulatory complexes (ISCOMs) composed of adjuvant Quil A and peptides [6] , and multiple antigen peptides (MAPs) also known as dendrimers [7] . A number of viral vectors based on adenoviruses, alphaviruses, avipoxiviruses, enteroviruses, flaviviruses, measles viruses (MV), rhabdoviruses, and vaccinia viruses have been engineered for vaccine development [3, 8] . In this context, self-replicating RNA virus vectors have proven highly efficient for immunization studies in various animal models [9] . Among RNA viruses, rabies virus (RABV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belonging to the rhabdovirus family carry a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of a negative polarity [10] . Likewise, MV possess a negative-sense ssRNA genome [11] . In contrast, flaviviruses and alphaviruses are of positive polarity. West Nile virus [12] and Kunjin virus [13] are the most common flaviviruses applied for immunization studies. Similarly, expression vectors have been engineered for alphaviruses such as Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [14] , Sindbis virus (SIN) [15] and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) [16] . In this review, various self-replicating RNA virus vectors are described and their applications as recombinant virus particles, RNA replicons and layered DNA plasmids are compared. Moreover, examples are given of utilization of self-replicating RNA virus systems for immunization studies in 

Both RABV [10, 31] and VSV [32, 33] have been subjected to expression vector engineering ( Figure 4 ). Similar to MV, reverse genetics has been applied for efficient recovery of VSV based on recombinant vaccinia virus, where the VSV N, P and L genes were inserted downstream of a T7 promoter and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [33] . The role of vaccinia virus has been to provide T7 RNA polymerase. However, vaccinia virus causes strong cytopathic effects in transfected cells, the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase contributes to homologous recombination between full-length genome and helper plasmids, and vaccinia virus may also contaminate recombinant virus stocks. For this reason, a BHK cell line stably expressing the T7 RNA polymerase was engineered as a vaccinia virus-free system for RABV [31] . In addition to rhabdovirus vectors, chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) have been generated by expressing the VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G) in trans with the SFV replicon by introduction of a mutated SFV 26S promoter for packaging of infectious SFV pseudoparticles [34] . This system provides high biosafety standards as VSV-G shares no homology with the SFV genome.

Foreign genes can be inserted between the N and P or G and L genes, respectively. CMV, cytomegalovirus promoter; G, rabies G protein; L, rabies L protein; M, rabies matrix protein; N, rabies nucleocapsid protein.

Self-replicating RNA virus vectors have been frequently used for vaccine development against infectious diseases and various types of cancers [9] . Both vectors based on ssRNA viruses of positive (Kunjin virus, SFV, SIN, VEE) and negative (MV, RABV, VSV) polarity have been utilized for the expression of viral surface proteins and tumor antigens followed by immunization studies in animal models. Moreover, for vaccination, different approaches including recombinant particles, RNA replicons and layered DNA plasmids have been applied.

The targets for vaccine development for infectious diseases comprise mainly surface antigens of pathogenic viruses (Table 1 ) and other infectious agents ( Table 2 ). Obvious targets for vaccine development have been antigens of influenza virus and HIV. In this context, recombinant SFV particles expressing influenza nucleoprotein (NP) have demonstrated strong immune responses [35] . Similarly, VEE-based expression of hemagglutinin (HA) elicited strong immune responses and even provided protection against challenges with H5N1 virus in chicken [36] . Likewise, expression of the swine influenza virus HA H3N2 gene from VEE vectors protected swine from influenza virus challenges [37] . In another study, the swine influenza HA gene was expressed from replicationdeficient alphavirus particles showing no spread of vaccine or reversion to virulence in the intended host (pig) or non-host (mouse) species [38] . Specific humoral and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses were observed in pigs, which were also protected against influenza virus challenges. Recombinant MV vectors carrying the HA gene have also been applied for vaccination studies [39] . Also VSV vectors have been utilized for vaccine development against influenza virus [40] . Instead of using full-length HA, expression of the stalk domain of HA generated chimeric HA (cHA) antigens. Both intramuscular and intranasal immunization of mice resulted in HA stalk-specific, cross-reactive antibodies. Prime-boost vaccination provided protection against lethal challenges with both homologous and heterologous influenza strains, which was significantly superior with intranasal administration. The structural genes are from the HEP-Flury strain except the G protein from the CVS strain. Foreign genes can be inserted between the N and P or G and L genes, respectively. CMV, cytomegalovirus promoter; G, rabies G protein; L, rabies L protein; M, rabies matrix protein; N, rabies nucleocapsid protein.

Likewise, expression of the swine influenza virus HA H3N2 gene from VEE vectors protected swine from influenza virus challenges [37] . In another study, the swine influenza HA gene was expressed from replication-deficient alphavirus particles showing no spread of vaccine or reversion to virulence in the intended host (pig) or non-host (mouse) species [38] . Specific humoral and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses were observed in pigs, which were also protected against influenza virus challenges. Recombinant MV vectors carrying the HA gene have also been applied for vaccination studies [39] . Also VSV vectors have been utilized for vaccine development against influenza virus [40] . Instead of using full-length HA, expression of the stalk domain of HA generated chimeric HA (cHA) antigens. Both intramuscular and intranasal immunization of mice resulted in HA stalk-specific, cross-reactive antibodies. Prime-boost vaccination provided protection against lethal challenges with both homologous and heterologous influenza strains, which was significantly superior with intranasal administration. For obvious reasons HIV has been a popular target for vaccine development. For instance, administration of Kunjin replicons expressing the HIV-1 gag antigen to BALB/c mice elicited gag-specific antibodies and protective gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses [41] . Interestingly, a single immunization with Kunjin virus particles induced 4.5-fold higher CD8+ T-cell responses and protection agains HIV challenges was obtained after two injections. Furthermore, RNA optimized Kunjin virus constructs for SIV Gag-Pol demonstrated improved effector memory and central memory responses as well as protection in primates [45] . Alphavirus vectors have also been employed for HIV vaccine development. Immunization with SFV particles expressing the Env [42] and gp41 [43] genes elicited humoral and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in mice. Interestingly, priming with a low dose (0.2 µg) DNA-based SFV replicon expressing the HIV Env and a Gag-Pol-Nef fusion prior to a heterologous boost with poxvirus (MVA) and/or HIV gp140 protein formulated in glycopyranosyl lipid A resulted in significantly enhanced immune responses [44] . Moreover, when macaques were immunized with a VSV vector carrying the SIV Env (smE660) gene neutralizing antibodies were obtained [46] . However, when challenged with SIVsmE660, all animals were infected. In contrast, vaccination with a combination of gag and Env resulted in immunity [47] . RABV vectors have also been employed for the expression of SIV Env and gag in macaques [48] . Although immune responses were detected for RABV glycoprotein G, no cellular responses were obtained against SIV antigens. However, replacing the RABV G with VSV G resulted in SIV-specific immune responses and immunized macaques were protected against SIV challenges.

A number of immunization studies have targeted such lethal viruses as Ebola and Lassa viruses. For instance, dose-dependent protection against Ebola virus was achieved in guinea pigs when immunized with Kunjin virus particles expressing the Ebola virus wild-type glycoprotein GP or a mutant GP (D637L) [49] . Similarly, African green monkeys were subcutaneously immunized with Kunjin particles carrying the Ebola GP D673L mutant [50] . Protection of three out of four primates was obtained against challenges with Zaire Ebola virus. Application of VSV vectors expressing the Ebola GP gene has also provided protection of macaques after challenges with the West African EBOV-Makuna strain [51] . Likewise, protection against three different Ebola strains was achieved by expression of Ebola GP from VSV vectors [52] . Alphavirus vectors have also been utilized for vaccine development against Ebola virus. In this context, RNA replicons derived from an attenuated VEE strain were applied for the expression of Ebola GP and nucleoprotein (NP) [53] . Immunization studies showed that VEE-GP alone or in combination with VEE-NP provided protection of both BALB/c mice and guinea pigs. In contrast, VEE-NP alone did not confer protection in guinea pigs, but did in mice. In another study, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with VEE particles expressing Ebola NP, which protected animals from Ebola virus challenges [54] .

VSV vectors have been subjected to immunization studies for expression of the Lassa virus glycoprotein (strain Josiah, Sierra Leone), which generated protection in guinea pigs after a single prophylactic injection [55] . It was also shown that macaques were protected against challenges with the genetically distinct Liberian Lassa virus isolate. Importantly, previous VSV-based Lassa virus vaccination did not have an impact on immunization with VSV-Ebola GP particles [77] . Furthermore, alphaviruses have been used for vaccine development against Lassa virus [56] . Guinea pigs immunized with VEE particles expressing Lassa virus glycoprotein or nucleoprotein showed protection against lethal challenges with Lassa virus. Furthermore, a dual expression approach for Ebola and Lassa virus glycoproteins was engineered, which led to protection against both Ebola and Lassa virus challenges.

A number of other viral antigens have been subjected to vaccine development. Currently, relevant targets comprise dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV). For instance, mice immunized with VEE particles expressing the SARS-CoV glycoprotein provided protection against lethal SARS-CoV challenges [57] . Furthermore, mice were immunized with MV vectors expressing the MERS-CoV glycoprotein, which resulted in induction of T-cell and antibody responses and protection against lethal doses of MERS-CoV [58] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has also been targeted with recombinant MV vectors by expression of the RSV fusion protein (RSV-F) [39] . Immunization of cotton rats induced neutralizing antibodies against RSV and protected against RSV infection in the lungs. In another application, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations were engineered for VEE RNA replicons, which demonstrated protection against RSV challenges in vaccinated mice [59] . Furthermore, immunization of African green monkeys with VEE particles expressing human RSV-F and metapneumovirus F (hMPV-F) proteins generated RSV-F and MPV-F-specific antibodies resulting in protection against RSV and MPV challenges [60] . In the context of dengue virus vaccines, a hybrid MV vector expressing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the dengue virus 2 envelope protein (DV2) elicited neutralizing antibodies against MV, HBsAg and DV2 [61] . In another study, MV-DV2 vaccination of mice generated IFN-γ and DV2 antibody responses and protection against four DV serotypes [62] . Alphavirus vectors have also been evaluated for dengue vaccine development. Expression of two configurations of dengue virus E antigen (prME and E85) provided protection in macaques [63] . Moreover, a single immunization of BALB/c mice was sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses [64] . The neonatal immunization was durable, could be boosted later in life and provided protection against challenges with dengue virus. Additional viral targets evaluated for vaccine development are listed in Table 1 .

Vaccine development has also been extended to other infectious diseases than caused by viral infections (Table 2 ). In this context, mice vaccinated with SFV vectors expressing the Plasmodium falciparum Pf332 antigen elicited immunological memory [68] . Similarly, strong immunity and long-term protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was obtained in mice immunized with SIN plasmid DNA vectors carrying the M. tuberculosis 85A antigen (Ag85A) [69] . Furthermore, expression of the botulinum neurotoxin A from layered SFV DNA plasmids elicited antibody and lymphoproliferative responses in immunized BALB/c mice [70] . Co-expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhanced the immune response. Replication-deficient SFV particles carrying the Brucella abortus translation initiation factor 3 (IF3) were subjected to immunization studies in BALB/c mice, which resulted in protection against challenges with the virulent B. abortus strain 2308 [71] . In another study, SIN vectors were utilized for the expression of the protective antigen (PA) for Bacillus antracis in Swiss Webster mice leading to the generation of specific and neutralizing antibodies and partial protection against challenges with pathogenic bacteria [72] .

Recombinant SIN vectors were applied for the expression of a class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted 9-mer epitope of the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein (CS), which induced a strong epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell response and a high degree of protection against malaria infection in mice [73] . Another approach to develop malaria vaccines involves the application of a live attenuated MV vaccine expressing recombinant antigens against malaria [78] . A modified replication-competent [74] . Due to the generation of neutralizing antibodies against VSV, immunization boosters were only possible for VSV-GP-OVA. CTL responses of similar potency as obtained for state-of-the-art adenovirus administration were observed and complete protection against challenges with Listeria monocytogenes was obtained in mice. In the context of prion disease, SFV DNA, RNA and recombinant particles were employed for the expression of prion protein (PRNP), which allowed generation of monoclonal antibodies against PRNP in immunized mice [75] .

Although not directly applied for vaccine development, the generated monoclonal antibodies will be useful for basic research and diagnostics for prions. Alphavirus vectors have also been applied for the development of vaccines against Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) [76] . Subcutaneous administration of VEE particles expressing SEB resulted in protection against challenge of wild-type SEB in mice.

A number of immunization studies have been carried out with self-replicating RNA virus vectors in the area of oncology (Table 3) . For instance, attenuated oncolytic MV strains such as the Edmonston-B (MV-Edm) strain demonstrated anti-tumor activity [79] . The MV-Edm strain does not cause any significant cytopathic effect in normal tissue, but can selectively infect and replicate in tumor cells based on evaluations in cell lines, primary cancer cells and xenograft and syngeneic models for B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma [80] , ovarian cancer [81] , glioblastoma multiforme [82] , breast [83] and prostate [79] cancers. In this context, tumor regression was obtained in SCID mice with human lymphoma xenografts after intratumoral injection of MV-Edm [80] . Moreover, co-administration of MV vectors expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in mice with SKOV3ip.1 ovarian xenografts showed superior tumor regression in comparison to treatment with either MV-CEA or MV-NIS alone [81] . To improve delivery and enhance efficacy, CD46 and signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) ablating mutations in the hemagglutinin protein in combination with the display of a single-chain antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were incorporated into MV vectors for tumor targeting [82] . Tumor regression and significantly extended survival were observed after intratumoral administration of MV. Evaluation of MV-CEA delivery in an MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor model revealed a significant delay in tumor growth and prolonged survival [83] . Moreover, intratumoral administration of MV-CEA vectors showed tumor growth delay and improved survival in a subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft model [79] .

Rhabdoviruses have also been applied in cancer therapy [84] . VSV vectors lack pre-existing immunity in humans and have demonstrated high susceptibility of cancer cells. Particularly, VSV vectors have been subjected to aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) showing superiority to Sendai virus and RSV in 13 clinically relevant human pancreatic cell lines, although the response varied from one cell line to another [85] . Moreover, evaluation in ten PDAC cell lines of three VSV vectors expressing the wild-type matrix protein or ∆M51 showed activation of VSV-mediated apoptosis [86] . However, high constitutive expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was discovered in three cell lines, which also contributed to resistance to apoptosis.

Kunjin virus replicons expressing the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been subjected to intratumoral administration, which resulted in cure in less than 50% of mice with established CT26 colon carcinoma and B16-OVA melanomas [87] . Subcutaneous injection led to regression in CT26 lung metastasis. Moreover, Kunjin vectors were engineered to express a CTL epitope of HPV16 E7 protein, which induced E7-directed T-cell responses and provided protection against challenges with an E7-expressing epithelial tumor in mice [88] . In this study, the Kunjin VLPs were more effective than RNA replicons or DNA vectors. Alphavirus vectors have been applied in many studies on cancer vaccines [4, 8] . In principle, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), immunomodulating cytokines and combination therapies of TAAs and cytokines, TAAs and antibodies, cytokines and antibodies and even microRNAs (miRNAs) have been evaluated. In this context, intratumoral injection of SFV particles expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) showed apoptosis induction in mice implanted with human non-small cell lung carcinoma H353a cells in mice [109] . Furthermore, intratumoral administration of SFV particles into BALB/c mice with implanted sarcoma K-BALB sarcoma and CT26 colon tumors resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition [103] . Also, vaccination of mice with SFV RNA replicons expressing β-galactosidase showed protection against challenges with colon tumor cells [100] . Only a single intratumoral injection of 1 µg of SFV-LacZ RNA resulted in 10-20 days of survival extension in mice with existing tumors. Similarly, SIN-LacZ vectors demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a mouse CT26 colon carcinoma model [101] . Despite not targeting specifically CT26 cells, SIN vectors showed susceptibility to mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs), which induced effector and memory CD8+ T-cells displaying robust cytotoxicity. The well-characterized human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) elicited neutralizing antibodies after VEE VLP immunization [120] . Moreover, melanoma antigens such as tyrosine-related proteins TRP-1 and TRP-2, gp100 and melanoma antigen tyrosinase (Tyr) have been expressed from VEE vectors [94, 112] . For instance, immunization of mice with VEE-TRP-2 particles resulted in growth inhibition of B16 transplantable melanoma and strong therapeutic potency [111] . Vaccination with VEE-TRP-2 VLPs was more efficient than the combination of VEE-gp100 and VEE-Tyr particles. Furthermore, VEE particles carrying the Tyr gene induced immune responses and tumor protection in mice after administration of VEE VLPs alone or an initial vaccination with plasmid DNA followed by boosting with VEE VLPs [112] .

Breast cancer has been targeted in several therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine studies. SIN plasmid DNA carrying the neu gene were subjected to immunization of mice resulting in inhibition of growth of challenged A2L2 tumor cells [94] . Interestingly, vaccination two days after tumor challenge was inefficient. In contrast, immunization in a prime-boost protocol with SIN-neu DNA followed by adenovirus vectors carrying the neu gene prolonged the survival of mice. Due to their potency of stimulation of antigen-specific T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs) were transduced by VEE-neu particles, which resulted in high-level transgene expression, DC maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [95] . Robust neu-specific CD8+ T-cell and anti-neu IgG responses were observed after a single immunization. Moreover, regression of large established tumors was obtained. Another TAA attractive for immunotherapy is the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP), which has demonstrated up-regulation in multiple cancer cell lines [121] . Transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMPC-2) tumor-bearing mice pre-immunized with VEE VLPs expressing STEAP demonstrated a strong immune response and a significantly prolonged overall survival [116] . The therapeutic affect was assessed for mice with 31-day-old tumors, which resulted in a modest but significant delay in tumor growth. Furthermore, VEE VLPs have been applied for expression of the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) in TRAMP mice, where the initial immunization with a PSCA DNA plasmid was followed by VEE-PSCA VLP delivery [117] . The outcome was a specific immune response and protection against tumor challenges in 90% of TRAMP mice. Also, the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been expressed from VEE vectors demonstrating strong humoral and cellular immune responses in subcutaneously immunized mice [115] . VEE VLPs expressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were used for immunization of mice followed by a challenge with TRAMP cells [118] . The VEE VLPs were capable of infecting DCs in vitro and induced a robust PSA-specific response in vivo. Tumors in vaccinated animals showed low PSA expression levels and tumor growth was significantly delayed.

The P815A antigen is expressed in P815 mastocytoma tumors, which triggered an immunization study on the P1A gene coding for the PP815A antigen [119] . SFV particles expressing the P1A gene elicited strong CTL responses and protected immunized mice from challenges with P815 tumors. Other interesting TAA vaccine targets have been the E6 and E7 proteins of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Immunization with SFV particles expressing HPV type 16 E6,7 showed strong HPV-specific CTL activity and eradicated HPV-transformed tumors [97] . Similarly, immunization of mice with VEE particles carrying the HPV16 E7 gene prevented tumor development and eliminated established tumors in 67% of vaccinated animals [99] . In another study, tattoo injection [122] of SFV-HPV E6,7 particles resulted in antigen expression in both the skin and draining lymph nodes leading to ten-fold lower antigen levels in comparison to intramuscular administration [98] . However, tattoo injection provided higher or equal levels of immune responses.

Cytokines have played an important role in immunotherapy and vaccine development [8] . For instance, interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been expressed from both SFV and SIN vectors. In this context, SFV vectors expressing IL-12 induced tumor regression with long-term tumor-free survival in the MC38 colon carcinoma model [102] . Repeated intratumoral administration increased the anti-tumor response. In another study, immunization with SFV-luciferase and SFV-IL-12 particles was evaluated in a woodchuck model in which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is induced by the infection by woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) [105] . High luciferase expression levels were observed in tumors and IL-12 secretion was measured in the serum after intratumoral injections. In tumor-bearing woodchucks, partial tumor remission was seen. Tumor volumes were reduced by 80%, but tumor growth was restored with time. The plasmid vector pTonL2(T)-mIL12, which provides liver-specific and inducible IL-12 expression, has been compared to SFV-IL-12 particle delivery in a L-PK/c-myc transgenic mouse model of HCC [106] . Overexpression of the c-myc gene in the liver of the transgenic animals induces spontaneous hepatic tumors with characteristics similar to human HCCs. Intratumoral administration of SFV-IL-12 resulted in tumor growth arrest and 100% survival rates. Mice treated with plasmid DNA showed a slightly lower survival rate despite higher IL-12 and IFN-γ levels in serum. The strong anti-tumor response in SFV-IL-12-treated mice was most likely due to the apoptosis and type 1 IFN response induced by SFV particles. Recombinant SIN particles were demonstrated to target tumor cells in SCID mice, which encouraged intraperitoneal injection of SIN-IL-12 particles in mice with established ovarian tumors [113] . The treatment resulted in systemic targeting and eradication of tumor cells without any adverse effects observed. Glioma-bearing mice were immunized with SFV-IL-12 particles, which induced apoptosis of glioma cells and facilitated the uptake of apoptotic cells by DCs and provided prolonged survival of vaccinated animals [91] . Moreover, DCs isolated from bone marrow were transduced with SFV vectors expressing IL-12 for the treatment of brain tumor-bearing mice [92] . The outcome was prolonged survival of immunized animals. In another study, SFV-IL-12 particles were tested in rat RG2 gliomas [93] . Low dose (5 × 10 7 VLPs) treatment resulted in a 70% reduction in tumor volume, whereas high-dose (5 × 10 8 VLPs) showed an 87% reduction in tumor volume. Moreover, intratumoral administration of 10 6 oncolytic SFV particles expressing EGFP generated significant tumor regression in melanoma-bearing SCID mice [123] . Other cytokines such as Il-18 have also been evaluated for alphavirus-based expression in ovarian and colon cancer models [104] . The enhanced SFV10E vector, which provides ten-fold higher levels of expression than the conventional SFV vector [124] , was applied for immunization of BALB/c mice [114] . After in vitro verification of secretion of active IL-18, mice with subcutaneous K-BALB and CT26 tumors were injected with SFV-IL-18 particles, which led to tumor regression and disappearance of tumors in some treated animals. Moreover, GM-CSF, an immunostimulatory cytokine, has been expressed from SFV vectors [114] . Intraperitoneal administration of SFV-GM-CSF particles was evaluated in an ovarian mouse tumor model, which resulted in activation of macrophages to tumor cytotoxicity. Although no prolongation in survival of tumor-bearing mice was achieved, tumor growth was inhibited for two weeks.

Among the growth factors targeted for vaccine development, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) was introduced into the SFV vector [96] . Immunization of mice with SFV-VEGFR-2 particles resulted in substantial inhibition of both tumor growth and spread of pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, vaccination led to tumor inhibition in mice with established CT26 colon tumors and metastatic 4T1 mammary tumors. In another approach, SFV particles carrying the endostatin gene were administered to mice bearing B16 brain tumors [89] . The treatment resulted in a substantial reduction in intratumoral vascularization in tumor sections and a significant inhibition of tumor growth. Endostatin serum levels were three-fold higher 7 days after intravenous administration of SFV-endostatin in comparison to administration of the retrovirus-based GCsap-Endostatin promoting inhibition of angiogenesis in established tumors. In another approach, SIN vectors have been employed for the expression of a fusion protein of HPV16 E7 protein and calreticulin (CRT), an ER Ca2 + -binding transporter participating in antigen processing and presentation with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I [108] . Immunization of mice bearing E7-expressing tumors with SIN-E7-CRT particles significantly increased E7-specific CD8+ T-cell precursors and a strong anti-tumor response. Furthermore, a significant reduction in lung tumor nodules was observed in immuno-compromised BALB/c mice. Combination therapy has been evaluated for alphavirus-based gene delivery. For instance, SFV layered DNA vectors were engineered to express one to four domains of VEGFR-2 and IL-12 [110] . Co-immunization with SFV replicon DNA expressing survivin and β-hCG antigens was verified in mice resulting in efficient humoral and cellular immune responses against survivin, β-hCG and VEGFR-2. Moreover, tumor growth was inhibited and the survival rate in a B16 melanoma mouse model was improved. Furthermore, immunization with SFV HPV E6/E7 was combined with sunitib and a single low-dose of irradiation, which enhanced the intratumoral ratio of anti-tumor effector cells to myeloid-derived suppressor cells [107] . Triple treatment of tumor-bearing mice demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and provided 100% tumor-free survival.

An interesting approach comprises the introduction of micro RNA-124 (miR-124) into an SFV4 vector [90] . As IFN-1 tolerance has been associated with the SFV nsP3-nsP4 genes, conditionally replicating SFV4-miR-124 virus was able to replicate in neurons and allowed targeting of gliomas otherwise sensitive to IFN-1. Evaluation of CT-2A mouse astrocytoma cells and IFN-1 pretreated human glioblastoma cells showed increased oncolytic potency. Moreover, a single intraperitoneal injection of SFV4-miR-124 into mice with implanted CT-2A orthotopic gliomas showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and improved survival rates.

Self-replicating RNA virus vectors have been subjected to several clinical studies, albeit at an inferior level in comparison to adenovirus, AAV and lentivirus vectors. For instance, healthy volunteers were subjected to low-dose (3 × 10 5 pfu) immunization with the VSV-based Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) expressing the Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein in a double-blinded study in comparison to a previous study with a high dose (5 × 10 7 pfu) [125] . No serious adverse events occurred and the overall safety was good. The low-dose immunization improved early tolerability, but generated inferior antibody responses and failed to prevent vaccine-induced arthritis, dermatitis or vasculitis. Furthermore, VSV particles expressing the HIV-1 gag gene were evaluated in a clinical trial on safety and immunogenicity [126] . In the randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled dose-escalation study, healthy HIV-negative volunteers received 4.6 × 10 3 to 3.4 × 10 7 pfu of rVSV HIV-1 gag vaccine intramuscularly at months 0 and 2. All vaccinated individuals showed antibody responses against VSV, and gag-specific T-cell responses were detected in 63%. Overall, the safety profile was good.

Alphaviruses have been subjected to some gene therapy and vaccine studies. In one approach, replication-deficient SFV particles were encapsulated in liposomes to promote passive targeting of tumors [127] . Initially, intraperitoneal administration of encapsulated SFV-LacZ particles showed enhanced accumulation of β-galactosidase in SCID mice implanted with LNCaP prostate tumors. Liposome-encapsulated SFV particles expressing the p40 and p35 subunits of IL-12 generated active secreted IL-12 in BHK-21 cells [128] . Next, encapsulated SFV-IL-12 particles were administered intravenously in terminally ill melanoma and kidney carcinoma patients in a phase I clinical trial. The patients showed a five to ten-fold increase in IL-12 plasma levels. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to 3 × 10 9 infectious particles and the safety profile was good. A phase I dose-escalation trial was conducted in prostate cancer patients with VEE particles expressing PSMA [129] . Patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) received up to five doses of either 0.9 × 10 7 IU or 0.36 × 10 8 IU of VEE-PSMA particles at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10 and 18. The study showed no toxicity and good toleration of the vaccination. However, only weak PSMA-specific immune responses were detected and no clinical benefits obtained. In another clinical trial, VEE particles expressing the CEA tumor antigen were demonstrated to efficiently infect DCs [120] . The VEE particles could be repeatedly administered and overcame high titers of neutralizing antibodies and elevated regulatory T cells (Tregs), which allowed induction of clinically relevant CEA-specific T cell and antibody responses. In another approach, VEE particles expressing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) gB and pp65/IE1 fusion protein were evaluated in a phase I randomized, double-blinded clinical trial [67] . Intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization at weeks 0, 8 and 24 of CMV seronegative adult volunteers showed good Most of the studies have been conducted with replication-deficient recombinant particles. However, promising results have also been obtained with layered DNA plasmid vectors. A limited number of studies have applied administration of RNA replicons, but the results have been quite encouraging. The obvious advantage to using nucleic acid-based delivery is the elimination of any risk of virus progeny production through recombination events. On the other hand, superior delivery and prolonged duration of expression can be achieved with recombinant viral particles, especially applying replication-proficient oncolytic viruses. For this reason, it is difficult to make any recommendations related to which delivery format to use, and the choice of target will play an important role in decision making.

Similarly, it is practically impossible to favor one viral vector system over another. Reverse genetics systems engineered for MV and rhabdoviruses and packaging cell lines for flaviviruses surely facilitate recombinant particle production and ease of use. Although packaging cell lines have also been generated for alphaviruses, the straightforward in vitro RNA transcription has provided the means for sufficient preparation of replicon RNA and particles for immunization studies. Obviously, plasmid DNA can be directly applied for vaccinations. In comparison to other viral vectors and also non-viral delivery systems, self-replicating RNA viruses can surely be considered competitive ( Figure 5 and Table 4 ). An extensive comparison to other delivery systems is not within the scope of this review, so only a few examples are addressed. Clearly, adenovirus-based vaccine development and gene therapy has a longer history, which has generated a multitude [130] of vector improvements and also resulted a number of clinical trials [131, 132] . Similarly, herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors have been frequently applied and HSV-GM-CSF have, for instance, been subjected to phase I−III human clinical trials in glioblastoma and melanoma patients [133] . HSV vectors were recently approved by the FDA for use in standard patient care [134] . Related to non-viral vectors, recently dendrimer-RNA nanoparticles have demonstrated protective immunity against lethal challenges with Ebola virus, influenza H1N1 virus and Toxoplasma gondii after a single injection in BALB/c mice [135] .

Overall, self-replicating RNA viral vectors possess several attractive features. The presence of RNA replicons provides the efficient means for rapid generation of a large number of RNA copies for immediate protein translation in the cytoplasm of host cells. Moreover, the strong subgenomic promoter utilized by alphaviruses generates extreme levels of heterologous gene expression. The transient nature of expression is also an advantage for immunization studies. Furthermore, there is no risk of integration of viral genes in the host genome as the viral RNA is degraded within 3-5 days. In the case of immunization with layered alphavirus DNA vectors, approximately 100-to 1000-fold lower doses are required compared to immunizations with conventional plasmid DNA [136] .

Although strong immune responses have been obtained and protection against challenges with lethal pathogens and tumor cells have been achieved and even tumor regression observed in animals with established tumors, some further technology development is necessary. Much development has been invested in vector design including mutant vectors, enhancement signals, targeting DCs and fusion constructs. Furthermore, quite an effort has been paid to the evaluation of different target antigens and immunogens. Several studies, particularly clinical trials, have indicated that although target-specific immune responses have been obtained, further investment is required in finding the right dose for the achievement of optimal response. One area which recently has received much attention is combination therapy. Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been combined with cytokines and antibodies, as well as drugs and radiation co-administered with cytokines. Additionally, optimization of adjuvant composition and stability issues in case of RNA delivery needs to be addressed. Further research in these areas will certainly provide progress and should make immunotherapy an important approach in both prophylactic and therapeutic applications. right dose for the achievement of optimal response.

Protective Efficacy of Passive Immunization with Monoclonal Antibodies in Animal Models of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype often cause severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure in humans, with reported case fatality rates of more than 60%. To develop a clinical antibody therapy, we generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) ch61 that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infections. Passive immunization with MAb ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice, and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge. In a cynomolgus macaque model, reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with MAb ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge. Protective effects were also noted in macaques under immunosuppression. Though mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by MAb ch61 were recovered from macaques treated with this MAb alone, combined treatment with MAb ch61 and peramivir reduced the emergence of escape mutants. Our results indicate that antibody therapy might be beneficial in reducing viral loads and delaying disease progression during H5N1 HPAI virus infection in clinical cases and combined treatment with other antiviral compounds should improve the protective effects of antibody therapy against H5N1 HPAI virus infection.","Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of two envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, H1-H16 HA and N1-N9 NA subtypes have been found in wild aquatic birds, the natural reservoir of influenza viruses [1] [2] [3] . Of these HA subtypes, only some avian influenza viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes are known to become highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses under natural conditions. While HPAI viruses cause an acute systemic disease in poultry with a mortality rate that often approaches 100%, avian to human transmission of HPAI viruses is limited and HPAI viruses had never been reported to cause lethal infection in humans until the first emergence of an H5N1 HPAI virus in southern China in 1996.

The H5N1 HPAI virus has been circulating in poultry for more than a decade since its reemergence in southern China in 2003, and has caused unprecedented outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The H5N1 HPAI virus occasionally infects humans with a high case mortality rate and poses a significant pandemic threat [11, 12, 13] . Since 2003, 641 laboratoryconfirmed human cases of H5N1 HPAI virus infection have been reported from 15 countries, with 380 fatal cases (as of October 8, 2013) [12] . In fact, prior to the emergence of the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic virus in 2009, the impact on animal and public health of the Asian origin H5N1 HPAI virus led to the prediction that a virus of the H5 subtype might cause the next pandemic, since this HA subtype is distinct from those of viruses circulating in the human population (i.e., subtypes H1 and H3) [13] .

In recent years, passive immunization with human or humanized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to viral proteins has been tested in animal models and clinical trials, providing evidence of the effectiveness of MAbs for prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases [14] . Indeed, a humanized MAb specific to Respiratory syncytial virus F protein is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and used in clinical cases. Importantly, particular attention has been paid to antibody therapy against highly lethal diseases such as rabies [15] [16] [17] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [18, 19] , Hendra [20] , Nipah [21] , and Ebola viruses [22] [23] [24] [25] .

It is known that HA, which is responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane, is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses. Since antibodies generally play a major role in protective immunity against influenza virus infection [26] , antibody therapy might be a potential option for preventing lethal infection of humans by the H5N1 HPAI virus. In this study, we genetically modified a mouse MAb (m61) neutralizing the infectivity of H5N1 HPAI viruses to create human-mouse chimeric MAb (ch61), aiming at clinical application, and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infection.

HPAI virus strains A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1) (HK483), A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) (VN1194), and A/Vietnam/ UT3040/2004 (H5N1) (VN3040) from the repository of our laboratory, were propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells from the repository of our laboratory and stored at 280uC until use. HK483, VN1194, and VN3040 belong to clades 0, 1, and 1 in a phylogenetic tree, respectively [27] . MDCK cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. All experiments using infectious viruses were performed in the biosafety level 3 facilities of the Hokkaido University Research Center for Zoonosis Control and Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science.

Mouse MAb 61-2-1 (m61), was generated according to standard procedures. Briefly, six-week-old female BALB/c mice (Japan SLC) were immunized intramuscularly two times with 100 mg of formalin-inactivated purified virions and boosted intraperitoneally [23] . Spleen cells harvested 3 days after boosting were fused to P3U1 myeloma cells according to standard procedures. Hybridomas were screened for secretion of HA-specific MAbs by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cloned by limiting dilution. The resulting cell clones were inoculated into BALB/c mice intraperitoneally to produce ascites. Antibodies were purified from ascites using the Affi-Gel Protein A MAPS II Kit (Bio-Rad). Mouse MAbs ZGP133 and ZGP226 used as control antibodies were generated as described previously [23] .

Human-mouse chimeric MAb ch61 was generated and purified from culture supernatants as described previously [23] . Briefly, total RNA was extracted from mouse hybridoma cells producing MAb m61, and the variable heavy-and light-chain regions were amplified by RT-PCR with primers designed for the antibodies. The PCR products were cloned into an expression vector. Stable cell lines expressing recombinant MAb ch61 were obtained by transfection of CHO DG44 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Chimeric MAbs (ch133 and ch226) specific for the Ebola virus glycoprotein were generated as control MAbs using the same methodology [23] . These human-mouse chimeric MAbs were purified from culture supernatants using rProtein A Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and EndoTrap red (Profos AG). MAb purity (.98%) and endotoxin levels (,1.0 EU/ml) were confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE and with an Endospecy ES-50M kit (Seikagaku Corporation), respectively.

Serially diluted antibodies (100 ml) were mixed with 200 plaque forming units (PFU) of H5N1 viruses for 1 h at room temperature, and inoculated onto MDCK cells. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the cells were overlaid with 1% Bacto-Agar (BD) in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM). Two days later, the number of plaques was counted and the percentage of plaque reduction was calculated.

Escape mutants were selected by culturing VN1194 in MDCK cells in the presence of MAb m61. Serial dilutions of VN1194 were mixed with purified MAb m61 (final concentration of 10 mg/ml), incubated for 1 h, and the mixtures were inoculated into confluent MDCK cells in 6-well tissue culture plates. After 1 h adsorption, the cells were overlaid with MEM containing 1% agar and MAb m61 ascites (final dilution of 1:1000), and then incubated for 2 days at 35uC. Eight escape mutants were purified from single

The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been circulating in poultry in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa since its first appearance in southern China in 1996. This virus occasionally infects humans with a high case mortality rate and poses a significant pandemic threat. Since neutralizing antibodies generally play a major role in protective immunity against influenza viruses, antibody therapy is a potential option for preventing highly lethal infection with the H5N1 virus in humans. Here we evaluated the protective potential of a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody with strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 viruses in mouse and nonhuman primate models of lethal H5N1 virus infection. The therapeutic use of the neutralizing antibody resulted in reduced viral loads and improved survival in animals infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. It was noted that the protective effects were more prominent in immunosuppressed macaques, which might provide a model of protection against severe clinical disease in immunocompromised patients. In addition, combination therapy together with an antiviral drug reduced the selection of escape mutants. Collectively, this study suggests that antibody therapy may have beneficial effects in clinical cases of H5N1 HPAI virus infection in humans.

isolated plaques, and propagated in MDCK cells with serum-free MEM containing trypsin. The nucleotide sequences of the HA genes of the parent strains and the escape mutants were determined and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared among these viruses (H3 numbering).

Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were passively immunized by intraperitoneal injection with 200 mg of purified MAbs m61 or ch61 24 hours before, or 24 hours or 72 hours after intranasal challenge with 50 ml of 12.5650% mouse lethal dose of HK483 under anesthesia with isoflurane. Control groups were administered with control antibodies (mixture of MAbs ZGP133/ZGP226 or ch133/ch226) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs. Five days after the challenge, mice were euthanized to obtain lung tissue samples. Lung homogenates (10% w/ v) prepared in MEM were centrifuged at 3,0006 g for 10 min, and then the supernatants were examined for virus infectivity. Virus titers were measured by a plaque assay using MDCK cells.

The animal experiments were conducted in strict compliance with animal husbandry and welfare regulations. Food pellets of CMK-2 (CLEA Japan) provided once a day after recovery from anesthesia and drinking water were available ad libitum. Animals were singly housed in the cages equipping bars to climb up and puzzle feeders for environmental enrichment under controlled conditions of humidity (6065%), temperature (2461uC), and light (12 h light/12 h dark cycle, lights on at 8:00 A.M.). Five-to sevenyear-old female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) from the Philippines (Ina Research) were used. The cynomolgus macaques used in the present study were healthy adults. The absence of influenza A virus NP-specific antibodies in their sera was confirmed before experiments using an antigen-specific ELISA, AniGen AIV Ab ELISA (Animal Genetics), for currently circulating influenza virus. Three weeks before virus inoculation, a telemetry probe (TA10CTA-D70, Data Sciences International) was implanted in the peritoneal cavity of each macaque under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia followed by isoflurane inhalation to monitor body temperature. The macaques used in this study were free from herpes B virus, hepatitis E virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Entamoeba histolytica. Individual macaques were distinguished by treatments and numbers: C: macaques injected with control MAbs, T: macaques treated with MAb ch61, IC: immunosuppressed macaques injected with control MAbs, IT: immunosuppressed macaques treated with 

Macaques (2.4-3.1 kg) were inoculated (day 0) with VN3040 (total 3610 6 PFU/7 ml) in their nasal cavities (0.5 ml for each nostril) and on their tonsils (0.5 ml for each tonsil) with pipettes and into the trachea (5 ml) with catheters under ketamine/ xylazine anesthesia. MAb ch61 or control MAbs (a mixture of MAbs ch133 and ch226) were administered intravenously twice (20 mg/head/dose; 6.5-8.3 mg/kg) on days 1 and 3 after infection. Animals were monitored daily (approximately every 12 hours) for clinical scoring (Table S1 ). Serum samples were obtained on days 21, 1, 3, 5, and 7. For virus titration, cotton sticks (TE8201, Eiken Chemical) were used to collect fluid samples from the nasal cavities and tracheas under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, and the sticks were subsequently immersed in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibiotics. A bronchoscope (Machida Endoscope) and cytology brushes (Olympus) were used to obtain bronchial samples. The brushes were immersed in 1 ml of PBS with BSA. Viral titers were determined by the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) in MDCK cells [28] . For immunosuppressive treatments of macaques, cyclophosphamide (CP) (Nacalai Tesque) and cyclosporine A (CA) (Novartis Pharma) were used [29] . CP (40 mg/kg) was administered intravenously by bolus injection on days 27, 25, 23, 21, and 0. CA (50 mg/kg) was administered orally into stomach using a catheter from day 27 to day 6. We confirmed that the treatment with CP and CA decreased the number of white blood cells in the macaques (Fig. S1 ). In some experiments, peramivir hydrate (30 mg/kg/dose, provided by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.) was administered intravenously by bolus injection once a day from day 1 to day 5 after infection [30] . Since patients with a severe respiratory illness might have a difficulty to intake or inhale drugs, we chose peramivir hydrate as an antiviral agent with intravenous injection. The concentrations of cytokines in sera and tissue homogenates were measured using the Milliplex MAP nonhuman primate cytokine panel and Luminex 200 (Millipore). Although the experiment was originally designed to collect samples from all animals for virology and immunology studies terminating on day 7, some animals were euthanized when their clinical scores reached 15 (a humane endpoint) and subjected to autopsy to collect tissue samples. Macaques that were unfortunately found dead during the intervals of the monitoring time points were also immediately subjected to autopsy. These animals (i.e., euthanized or dead) were counted as nonsurvivors.

After autopsy on indicated days after virus infection, lung tissue samples were fixed with 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigens were stained with antisera of rabbits immunized with an NP synthetic peptide (AFTGNTEGRTSDMR at positions 428-441 of the NP sequence: GenBank accession number, ADC34563) after treatment in a pressure cooker in 0.01 M citrate-phosphate buffer. After incubation with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Nichirei Bioscience Inc.), NP was detected with diaminobenzidine (Nichirei Biosciences Inc.).

Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments of the Science Council of Japan. The animal experiments were conducted in strict compliance with animal husbandry and welfare regulations. The mouse study was approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Care and Use Committee (Permit number: 08-0234). The nonhuman primate study was also carried out in strict accordance with the Guidelines for the Husbandry and Management of Laboratory Animals of the Research Center for Animal Life Science at Shiga University of Medical Science and Standards Relating to the Care and Management, etc. of Experimental Animals (Notification No. 6, March 27, 1980 of the Prime Minister's Office, Japan). The protocol was approved by the Shiga University of Medical Science Animal Experiment Committee (Permit number: 2011-6-9HHH). All procedures were performed under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Regular veterinary care and monitoring, balanced nutrition, and environmental enrichment were provided by the Research Center for Animal Life Science at the Shiga University of Medical Science. Macaques were euthanized at endpoint (7 days after virus inoculation for immunological and virological analysis) using ketamine and xylazine anesthesia followed by intravenous injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Animals were monitored twice a day during the study to be clinically scored as shown in Table S1 . Animals would be euthanized if their clinical scores reached 15 (a humane endpoint).

MAb m61 showed neutralizing activities against HK483 and VN1194 (Fig. 1A) . The 50% inhibitory concentrations of MAb m61 against HK483 and VN1194 were 0.42 and 0.92 mg/ml, respectively. To determine the epitope for MAb m61, escape mutants of VN1194 were selected in the presence of this MAb and the deduced amino acid sequences of the parent virus and mutants were compared. Lysine to threonine, asparagine, and glutamic acid substitutions were found at position 193 in 12.5, 25.0, and 12.5% of the cloned mutants, respectively, and 50% of the mutants had substitution from lysine to glutamic acid at position 222 (data not shown). The amino acid residue at position 193 is located near the receptor-binding site on the antigenic sites of HA molecules [31] [32] [33] [34] . Accordingly, MAb m61 showed hemagglutination-inhibition activity (data not shown). We then converted MAb m61 into the human-mouse chimeric MAb ch61, and its neutralizing activities against HK483, VN1194, and VN3040 were analyzed in vitro (Fig. 1B) . MAb ch61 significantly reduced the infectivity of these H5N1 viruses in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the negative control MAbs did not. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of MAb ch61 against HK483, VN1194, and VN3040 were 0.43, 1.00, and 2.29 mg/ml, respectively. These values were similar to those of the original mouse MAb m61, indicating that genetic modification of this MAb did not significantly affect the neutralizing activity in vitro.

Control mice were given control antibodies (ZGP133+ZGP226 or ch133+ch226) or PBS. Five days after the challenge, lung tissue samples were collected to measure virus titers (D). The averages titers and standard deviations of 5 mice are shown. Titers below the limit of detection were assigned a value of 2. Significant differences (Student t-test) were indicated by asterisks (*** p,0.001, ** p,0.01, * p,0.05). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004192.g002 Table 1 . Summary of treatments and survival rates of macaques.

Animal ID CP and CA MAb Peramivir Protective efficacy of passive immunization with MAbs m61 and ch61 in mice

We next investigated the potential of MAbs m61 and ch61 to protect mice from infection by HK483, known to be highly virulent for mice [35, 36] . Mice treated with these antibodies 1 day before or 1 day after virus challenge with a lethal dose of HK483 survived without clinical symptoms, whereas all control mice died (or were euthanized) within 9 days after the challenge (Figs. 2A, B) . Control mice uniformly showed severe weight loss (.25%) (data not shown). Treatment at 3 days after infection also partially protected the mice (Fig. 2C) , although 2 surviving mice treated with m61 showed moderate weight loss (,15%) (data not shown). All control mice exhibited severe weight loss (.25%) and succumbed to HK483 infection. Consistent with the survival data, lung virus titers of mice treated with these anti-H5 HA MAbs 1 day before virus challenge were significantly lower than those of mice given the respective control antibodies (Fig. 2D) . While of statistical significance, treatment after infection only modestly reduced the titers (Fig. 2D) . These results indicated that MAbs m61 and ch61 were highly protective against H5N1 HPAI virus in mice.

To examine therapeutic efficacy of MAb ch61 in a nonhuman primate model of H5N1 HPAI virus infection, VN3040 was used, since this virus causes severe, often lethal, disease in cynomolgus macaques [37] . Macaques were infected with VN3040 on day 0 and treated with MAb ch61 or control MAbs twice on days 1 and 3 after infection. Body temperatures rose upon infection and decreased after the first injection of MAb ch61, but rose again on days 4-5 (Fig. S2) . One of three macaques injected with control MAbs (C3) died on day 4, whereas all three macaques treated with MAb ch61 survived until day 7 after infection ( Table 1 , Exp. #1). The viral titers in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial samples of macaques treated with MAb ch61 were lower than those of macaques injected with control MAbs after the first injection of MAbs (i.e., on days 2 and 3) (Figs. 3A-C). In one of the MAb ch61-treated macaques (T1), the virus was only slightly detected in the nasal and bronchial samples on days 3-7 (Figs. 3A, C). Although the virus was recovered from the nasal samples of the other treated macaques (T2 and T3), the titers were lower than those of macaques injected with control MAbs (C1, C2, and C3) (Fig. 3A) . Infectious viruses were recovered from lungs of most of the macaques even on day 7 (Table 2) . Interestingly, the viral titers in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial samples drastically increased after day 4 in one macaque treated with MAb ch61 (T3) (Figs. 3A-C). Similar phenomenon was partially observed in the other treated macaques. Viral titers in tracheal and bronchial samples were often higher in T2 and T3 than in control macaques on days 4-7 (Figs. 3B, C) . Accordingly, relatively high titers of the virus was detected in their lungs collected on day 7 ( Table 2) . Two of the treated macaques (T2 and T3) lost their appetite after virus infection and their clinical scores were increased, but they temporally recovered after injection of MAb ch61 (Fig. 3D) . These results indicated that MAb ch61 reduced viral titers in the respiratory secretions of all the treated macaques, although inhibition of viral propagation was temporary in two of the treated macaques. We confirmed that the MAb concentrations on days 3-7 after challenge were maintained at above 20 mg/ml in all treated macaques up to day 7 (Fig. 3E) . Thus, to examine the appearance of escape mutants, we sequenced viral RNAs extracted from the tracheal samples collected from MAb ch61-treated macaques on day 5. We found amino acid substitutions identical to those seen in the escape mutants selected in vitro (i.e., K193N or K193E) in 83% (5/6) and 25% (3/12) of the cloned viral genes obtained from T1 and T3, respectively, indicating that viral escape occurred during the treatment period.

To further examine the protective potential of MAb ch61, we used an immunocompromised macaque model with influenza virus infection [29] . Macaques were pretreated with CP and CA and then infected with VN3040 on day 0. Increased body temperature was observed after infection in most of the macaques (IC1, IC2, IC3, IT1, IT2, IT3, and IT5) (Fig. S3) . Body temperatures that rose upon infection decreased after the treatment with MAb ch61 in IT1 and IT2, but rose again on days 6-7. All three macaques injected with control MAbs succumbed to infection by day 5 (IC1, IC2, and IC3), whereas two (IT3 and IT4) of the five macaques injected with MAb ch61 also died on days 6 and 4, respectively (Table 1 , Exp. #2).

Infectious viruses were consistently detected in the nasal, tracheal, and bronchial samples of macaques injected with control MAbs until death (Figs. 4A-C). On the other hand, the viral titers in the nasal samples of IT2, IT4, and IT5, and those in the tracheal samples of all five macaques treated with MAb ch61 decreased on days 2 and 3 (i.e., after injection of the antibody) (Figs. 4A, B) . It was also noted that the viral titers in the bronchial samples of IT1, IT3, and IT5 were markedly reduced on days 2 and 3 (Fig. 4C) . However, in the bronchial samples of IT2 and IT4, the titers on days 2 and 3 were similar to those of control macaques (Fig. 4C) . Clinical scores in IT2 and IT5 were improved (clinical score = 0) on day 7 and IT1 slightly regained its appetite after MAb treatment (Fig. 4D) . The viral titers increased on days 4-7 in the trachea and bronchial samples of some of the treated macaques (e.g., IT1 and IT2), as was the case with treatment of immunocompetent macaques. Furthermore, infectious viruses were detected in all lobes of their lungs, while the virus replication in the lungs of the other treated macaques was limited on day 7 (Table 2) . Viruses with the K193R substitution in HA were recovered from the tracheal samples of IT1 and IT2 (11/11 and 17/18 of the cloned HA genes, respectively), whereas the concentrations of MAb ch61 circulating in the serum on days 3-7 after challenge were maintained at above 20 mg/ml in all treated macaques (Fig. 4E) . These results indicated that treatment Table S1 (D). Concentrations of MAb ch61 (E) and IL-6 (F: serum and G: lung) were examined as described in the legend of Figure 3 . Lung tissue samples were collected at autopsy from IC1 on day 3, from IC2 on day 5, from IC3 on day 4, from IT3 on day 6, and from IT4 on day 4. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004192.g004

with MAb ch61 resulted in reduced viral loads and partial protection from lethal HPAI virus infection in immunosuppressed macaques, though this MAb treatment might select escape mutants.

Efficacy of combination therapy using anti-H5 antibody and a neuraminidase inhibitor in immunocompromised macaques infected with H5N1 HPAI virus isolated from a human patient

Since escape mutants were frequently selected in macaques treated with MAb ch61 alone, we examined combination therapy with MAb ch61 and the neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir to further reduce viral replication and the emergence of escape mutants. CP-and CA-pretreated macaques were infected with VN3040 and then MAbs were injected on days 1 and 3 in addition to continuous administration of peramivir on days 1-5. Two macaques treated with peramivir alone had to be humanely euthanized on days 5 and 4 (ICP1 and ICP3, respectively), whereas one macaque that received the combined treatment also died on day 3 (ITP3) ( Table 1 , Exp. #3). Increased body temperature was observed in two control and one ch61-treated macaques (ICP1, ICP3, and ITP2) (Fig. S4) . The viral titers in the nasal and tracheal samples of macaques treated with both MAb ch61 and peramivir were almost undetectable after day 3 (Figs. 5A,  B) . Unlike MAb treatment alone (Figs. 3 and 4) , no increase of the viral titer or body temperature was observed on days 4-7 in surviving macaques treated with MAb ch61 together with peramivir (Figs. 5A-C and Fig. S4 ) and the concentrations of MAb ch61 in the serum were maintained at above 20 mg/ml on days 3-7 after challenge in these macaques (Fig. 5E) . Accordingly, infectious viruses were only slightly detected in the limited parts of lungs of the macaques ( Table 2 ) and escape mutations (i.e., K193N or K193E) were not found in the cloned viral genes (0/11) obtained from the MAb ch61-treated macaques. Along with the reduced viral recovery from the samples, clinical scores in ITP1 and ITP2 were generally improved on day 7. These results indicated that combination therapy with MAb ch61 and peramivir inhibited viral propagation more efficiently than MAb or peramivir treatment alone, which might also result in reduced selection of escape mutants and improved survival after H5N1 HPAI virus infection in macaques. . Protection of immunocompromised macaques treated with MAb ch61 and peramivir from VN3040 infection. Macaques pretreated with CP and CA were infected and injected intravenously with control MAbs (ICP1-ICP3, orange) and MAb ch61 (ITP1-ITP3, blue) and with peramivir as described in the legend of Figure 3 . Viral titers in nasal (A), tracheal (B), and bronchial (C) swab samples were determined using MDCK cells. Clinical signs were scored with the parameters shown in Table S1 (D). Viral titers under the detection limit are indicated as 0. Concentrations of MAb ch61 (E) and IL-6 (F: serum and G: lung) were examined as described in the legend of Figure 3 . Lung tissue samples were collected at autopsy from ITP3 on day 3, from ICP3 on day 4, from ICP1 on day 5, and from other macaques on day 7. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004192.g005

Correlation between disease severity and elevated levels of IL-6

To determine the cause of death of the macaques, we examined inflammation by measuring IL-6 production in sera and lung tissues. In the immunocompetent macaque model, an elevated IL-6 level was observed on day 3 in the serum of one macaque (C3) that died on day 4 but not in the other macaques (Fig. 3F ). In addition, the lung IL-6 level of C3 on day 3 was markedly higher than those of the other macaques (Fig. 3G) . In the immunocompromised macaque model, a marked increase of IL-6 was detected in the sera and/or lung tissues of all macaques injected with control MAbs (Figs. 4F, G) . Similarly, increased IL-6 levels were detected in IT4. In a MAb ch61-treated macaque that died on day 6 (IT3), bacterial infection was detected in the cerebral ventricle (data not shown) and the rapid IL-6 response was not observed, suggesting that this macaque died of bacterial meningitis, not virus infection. In the combination therapy experiment, increased levels of IL-6 were detected in the sera of ICP1, ICP3, and ITP3, all of which were humanely euthanized or died after infection (Fig. 5F ). IL-6 levels in lung tissues were relatively high in ICP3 and ITP3 (Fig. 5G) . Consistent with some human cases previously described [38, 39] , these results suggested that increases of IL-6 in the serum and lungs might be associated with systemic inflammatory responses leading to death. While increased production of TNFa and IL-1b were also seen in the macaques with severe disease, the other cytokines tested were unlikely correlated with disease severity of the macaques (Figs. S5, S6) . Since elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-a and IL-1b are likely involved in a variety of systemic inflammatory states that are associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction, these cytokines could be important mediators of increased endothelial permeability, which might result in systemic organ failure caused by H5N1 HPAI virus infection. 

To evaluate the progression of disease after the antibody treatment, we examined the lung pathology of the macaques subjected to autopsy. Macroscopically, dark red areas representing inflammation and congestion were larger in the lungs of control immunocompetent macaques (C1-C3) than in the lungs of two immunocompetent macaques treated with MAb ch61 (T1 and T2) (Fig. 6 ). The dark red area was larger in the lung of T3 than in the lungs of T1 and T2. These findings were concordant with virus titers in the lungs collected at autopsy (Table 2 ). In immunosuppressed macaques treated with control antibodies (IC1-IC3), the macroscopic lesions with inflammation, hemorrhage, and congestion in the lungs were much smaller than those in the lungs of immunocompetent macaques (C1-C3) (Figs. 6, 7) . In immunosuppressed macaques treated with MAb ch61 (IT1-IT5), the reddish lesions were smaller than those in control macaques (IC1-IC3) (Fig. 7) . In particular, macroscopic inflammation in IT5 was observed only around the central bronchus. In immunosuppressed macaques also treated with peramivir, macroscopic reddish lesions were smaller than those in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed macaques treated without peramivir (Figs. [6] [7] [8] . The lung of ICP3, which died on day 4 after virus infection, had dark red, edematous lesions.

We then examined histological changes of the lungs collected from the infected macaques (Figs. [9] [10] [11] . Severe pneumonia reducing air space was seen in a control immunocompetent macaque (C2) and a macaque treated with MAb ch61 (T1) (Figs. 9A, B) . In high magnification images, lymphoid and neutrophilic infiltration, thickened alveolar walls, and alveolar edema were observed (Figs. 9C, D) . The other macaques (C2, T2, and T3) euthanized on day 7 showed similar histological changes (data not shown). In immunohistochemical staining for the influenza virus antigens, NP-positive cells were widely distributed and accumulated focally in the lung of the control macaque 7 days after virus infection (Fig. 9E ). By contrast, NP-positive cells were seen but did not accumulate in the MAb ch61-treated macaque (Fig. 9F) . Reduced numbers of NP-positive cells were also seen in the lungs of the other treated macaques (T2 and T3) (data not shown).

In macaques under the immunosuppressed condition, lymphoid infiltration was very mild compared with immunocompetent macaques. In the lung tissue obtained from a control macaque (IC3) at 4 days after virus infection, pulmonary edema was seen in the alveoli, resulting in loss of air space (Figs. 10A, C). In a macaque treated with MAb ch61 (IT2), the air space was decreased and alveolar septa were thickened in part, but the air content was still preserved (Figs. 10B, D) . NP-positive cells were seen in the alveolar epithelium of the control macaque more frequently than in that of the MAb ch61-treated macaque (Figs. 10E, F) . The cuboidal epithelial cells positive for the NP antigen were type II alveolar epithelial cells. Less severe histological changes and virus infection were also seen in the other treated macaques (IT1 and IT3) compared with the control macaques (data not shown). These differences in the histological changes and frequencies of NP-positive cells between control and MAb ch61-treated macaques were also seen in the macaques treated together with peramivir (Fig. 11 ).

Current strategies for the control of influenza include vaccination and antiviral drug treatment. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been used for H5N1 HPAI virus infection in humans as well as seasonal influenza caused by viruses of the H1 and H3 HA subtypes. However, the efficacy of the neuraminidase inhibitors on the human H5N1 infections is unclear due to the inevitable lack of adequate control studies. Moreover, drug-resistant H5N1 viruses were indeed detected in patients [40, 41] and, importantly, H5N1 viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors were also isolated from chickens in the endemic area [42] . Thus, alternative strategies for prophylaxis and treatment need to be developed for pandemic preparedness against the H5N1 influenza virus.

Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies may provide an alternative strategy for both prophylaxis and treatment of pandemic influenza. It was reported that an H5N1 HPAI virusinfected patient recovered after treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting that passive immunotherapy may be a promising option for the treatment of H5N1 HPAI virus infection [43] . The efficacy of mouse MAbs specific for H5 HAs been evaluated in a mouse model with promising results for both treatments and prophylaxis [44, 45] . However, for clinical use, induction of anti-mouse MAb-specific antibody responses should reduce the neutralizing capacity of given MAbs and also limit the repeated use of mouse antibodies. Thus, passive immunotherapy with human or humanized MAbs has also been tested in mouse and ferret models [46] [47] [48] [49] . Nevertheless, the protective potential of anti-H5 MAbs remained to be elucidated in a nonhuman primate model of H5N1 HPAI virus infection.

To help develop a clinical antibody therapy, we also generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb ch61) that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in animal models. In particular, we used a cynomolgus macaque model, which simulates the H5N1 HPAI virus infection of humans more faithfully and thus has been used as an animal model for vaccine and pathogenesis studies on influenza virus infection [50] . We found that treatment with MAb ch61 reduced viral loads and partially protected macaques from lethal infection with the H5N1 HPAI virus. It was noteworthy that the protective effect was more prominent in immunosuppressed macaques, which might provide a model of protection against severe clinical disease in immunocompromised patients. Thus, this proof of concept study provides the first evidence that antibody therapy may have beneficial effects in clinical cases of H5N1 HPAI virus infection in humans. Importantly, however, mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by MAb ch61 were recovered from some of the macaques treated with MAb ch61 alone and became predominant by 7 days after infection, whereas reduced virus replication upon treatment with MAb ch61 was observed in most of the treated macaques during the initial phase of infection. These results suggest that, as was shown in a mouse model of H5N1 HPAI virus infection [51] , combination therapy using two different MAbs might be needed to prevent the generation of escape mutants and would likely be more beneficial.

Taken together, the results obtained in the present study demonstrated that the therapeutic use of anti-H5 neutralizing MAb ch61 resulted in reduced viral loads and improved protection in a nonhuman primate model of lethal H5N1 virus infection. In addition, it was also shown that combination therapy with the antiviral drug provided better protection and reduced the emergence of escape mutants. Combination therapy with other antibodies recognizing different epitopes may also attenuate symptoms and prevent the selection of escape mutants.

Preparation of recombinant vaccines,"Vaccination is one of the most efficient ways to eradicate some infectious diseases in humans and animals. The material traditionally used as vaccines is attenuated or inactivated pathogens. This approach is sometimes limited by the fact that the material for vaccination is not efficient, not available, or generating deleterious side effects. A possible theoretical alternative is the use of recombinant proteins from the pathogens. This implies that the proteins having the capacity to vaccinate have been identified and that they can be produced in sufficient quantity at a low cost. Genetically modified organisms harboring pathogen genes can fulfil these conditions. Microorganisms, animal cells as well as transgenic plants and animals can be the source of recombinant vaccines. Each of these systems that are all getting improved has advantages and limits. Adjuvants must generally be added to the recombinant proteins to enhance their vaccinating capacity. This implies that the proteins used to vaccinate have been purified to avoid any immunization against the contaminants. The efficiency of a recombinant vaccine is poorly predictable. Multiple proteins and various modes of administration must therefore be empirically evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The structure of the recombinant proteins, the composition of the adjuvants and the mode of administration of the vaccines have a strong and not fully predictable impact on the immune response as well as the protection level against pathogens. Recombinant proteins can theoretically also be used as carriers for epitopes from other pathogens. The increasing knowledge of pathogen genomes and the availability of efficient systems to prepare large amounts of recombinant proteins greatly facilitate the potential use of recombinant proteins as vaccines. The present review is a critical analysis of the state of the art in this field.","The pioneering work of E. Jenner, L. Pasteur and others made it possible the eradication of smallpox from the earth by vaccinating a large number of people. Other diseases like hepatitis B and gastroenteritis induced by rotavirus might also be markedly reduced using vaccination.

The method commonly used to prepare vaccines consists of obtaining sufficient amount of attenuated or inactivated pathogens and administering this material to humans or animals. Attenuated forms of the pathogen are generally obtained by natural mutation followed by a selection. The number of random mutants may be increased by using mutagenic chemicals or BIOTECHNOLOGY ANNUAL REVIEW VOLUME 13 ISSN 1387-2656 DOI: 10 .1016/S1387-2656(07)13004-0 r 2007 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED irradiation. Alternatively, known virulent genes may be removed from the pathogen genome using genetic engineering. The native pathogen may also be inactivated by physicochemical treatment. This approach suffers from several limitations. Attenuated exploitable forms of the pathogen may not be obtained in all cases. The tools commonly used for that purpose are animal cell lines and chicken eggs. The live vaccines obtained in this way are generally potent but their composition is complex and they may induce severe deleterious effects precluding their use. This was the case for a live-attenuated vaccine against rotavirus, which induced severe intestine inflammation (intussusceptions) [1] . New vaccines still containing attenuated retrovirus are under development with expected reduced side effects [2, 3] . Even in case of success, possible unknown side effects may persist with live vaccines. One is that the vaccinated persons are effectively protected but still shedding wild active viruses contributing to support the epidemic. Another problem generated by the use of attenuated or inactivated pathogen is that it is difficult to make a distinction between animals or humans who are vaccinated and those who are infected. Indeed, the same antibodies against the pathogens are present in the blood of both categories of animals or people. The absence of one gene of the pathogen may make the distinction possible between vaccinated and infected individuals. Alternatively, serum antibody markers resulting from the immunization by a foreign antigen added to the vaccine may also distinguish vaccinated and infected individuals. Viral vectors can be used to express genes coding for vaccinating proteins from another pathogen. This system cumulates the advantage of using the efficiency of the viral vector to transfer and express the foreign gene. Several strains of vaccinia virus and adenoviruses from different origins are being used successfully to vaccinate animals. Naked DNA under the form of plasmids and harboring genes coding for vaccinating proteins is also a simple, versatile and safe tool to vaccinate animals. This method still needs to be improved before being approved for animals and humans.

A possible alternative consists of using subunits of the pathogens containing one or a few proteins organized as in the pathogens and forming viruslike particle (VLP) in the case of viruses [4] . This approach is expected to be safe as the material does not contain nucleic acids from the pathogen or from the vectors used to carry the gene coding for vaccinating proteins, which may be plasmids or viral vectors. This approach also makes it possible the distinction between vaccinated and infected individuals as antibodies are raised against most of the pathogen proteins after infection and only against a few of them after vaccination. The preparation of recombinant vaccines may be efficient but not easy to implement. Indeed, a long study may be necessary to define which proteins have a sufficient vaccinating capacity and ideally are efficient against most if not all the forms of the pathogens. The proteins cannot generally be obtained from the pathogen in sufficient quantity. Systems capable of providing large amounts of recombinant proteins at a low cost must then be implemented. The isolated proteins are also generally less potent to induce an immune response than the whole pathogens, mainly if they are living. This implies the use of potent adjuvants, which must be devoid of deleterious side effects. The vaccinating proteins must therefore be purified to prevent any immune response against their contaminants. The vaccinating potency of recombinant proteins is largely unpredictable and this obliges experimenters to evaluate the efficiency of various modes of administration with different adjuvants.

The increasing knowledge of pathogen genomes offers multiple possibilities to identify proteins and even epitopes capable of inducing a protection against the pathogens. It has become possible to test one by one the different antigens of a pathogen. This approach implies the systematic cloning of the genes coding for putative vaccinating proteins, the preparation of the corresponding proteins and the evaluation of their capacity to be used as vaccines. This brute-force method already resulted in an unprecedented burst of new antigen discovery. A less laborious approach recently met a great success to identify new antigens from group A Streptococcus. This method consists of releasing fragments of the surface antigens by treating the bacteria with proteases. The peptides were identified by mass spectrometry and the corresponding genes were cloned to prepare and evaluate the corresponding antigens. This method allowed the fast identification of antigens for vaccination [5] . This method should be applied for a number of pathogens [6] .

Several systems are becoming efficient to produce large amount of recombinant proteins including vaccines. Among these systems are transgenic animals and plants.

A pathogen protein having potent vaccination properties may theoretically be used as carriers for epitopes from other pathogens. In practice, the generation of fusion proteins harboring the epitopes and capable of inducing a protection against the pathogen is not an easy task.

The present review examines the different steps in the preparation and the evaluation of recombinant proteins to be used as vaccines.

The different systems to produce recombinant vaccines Different systems are being implemented to produce recombinant proteins for experimental use or for biotechnological applications. They include peptide chemical synthesis, microorganisms, animal cells, plant cells, transgenic plants and transgenic animals (Table 1) .

A number of peptides covering a pathogen protein known to induce vaccination may be chemically synthesized and tested for their capacity to induce a protection against a pathogen. This was achieved with the fragments of VP6 proteins from rotavirus [7, 8] . Essential epitopes of a protein for vaccination may thus be determined. This also makes it possible the identification of the mechanisms of the immune response induced by each epitope. The peptides containing relevant epitopes may then be chemically synthesized and chemically linked to carrier proteins. The resulting material may be used as vaccine. Alternatively, fusion recombinant proteins containing the epitopes of interest and a carrier protein known to induce vaccination may be prepared (see below).

Microorganisms were the first to be used to produce recombinant proteins. Human insulin has been prepared for the last twenty years by bacteria. Although highly efficient for some proteins, bacteria show limited possibilities due to the fact that they cannot fold properly a number of proteins and proceed to posttranslational modifications [9] . Bacteria may produce so high amount of recombinant proteins that they form inclusion bodies precluding an easy purification. Some proteins are toxic for bacteria and cannot be prepared in this way. Interestingly, VP6 protein prepared from bacteria proved to have vaccinating capacity almost similar to the protein prepared from insect Sf9 cells infected by recombinant baculovirus harboring the corresponding viral gene [7, [8] [9] [10] 11] . Yeast may be easily transformed but they often produce limited amount of recombinant proteins, which are not glycosylated or unduly glycosylated. Interestingly, several genes coding for glycosylating enzymes have been transferred into yeast, which has become capable of adding several of the carbohydrates present in human proteins [12] . It is interesting to mention that a part of the hepatitis B vaccine is prepared from recombinant yeast. It is also important to note that the viral protein prepared from yeast does not form correctly polymers by disulfide bridges. The protein must therefore be chemically reduced to allow an appropriate formation of disulfide cross-links and VLPs having full vaccinating potency.

Various animal cells are currently being used to prepare recombinant proteins for experimental studies or for biotechnical applications [13] . It is interesting to note that most of the recombinant proteins used as pharmaceuticals are being prepared from animal cells.

One of the cell systems frequently used in laboratories to prepare viral proteins is the baculovirus-Sf9 cell system. This system is relatively simple to use and it proved efficient to prepare well-assembled viral proteins forming VLPs [4] . To reach this goal, the viral genes are introduced into baculovirus by homologous recombination in insect Sf9 cells. The resulting viral particles are used to infect a large number of Sf9 cells that produce high amounts of viral proteins, which are not secreted but stored in cytoplasm to form spontaneously well-shaped VLPs. The VLPs can be isolated from cell lysate and purified using different protocols. One of them consists of fractionating VLPs in cesium chloride gradients. Several VLPs prepared in this way show structure similar to native corresponding viral complex as judged by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. The baculovirus system makes it possible the preparation of VLPs from a broad variety of viruses having or not a simple or a double capsid and an envelope [4] . This tool allows the preparation of VLPs in sufficient quantity to determine their structure and to evaluate their vaccinating properties. The baculovirus-Sf9 system cannot be easily scaled up to prepare vaccines at an industrial scale.

Mammalian cells can be used to prepare recombinant proteins. CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells are most frequently used to prepare pharmaceutical proteins. One of the advantages of these cells is that they proceed to most of the posttranslational modifications of proteins. However, glycosylation of recombinant proteins secreted by CHO may be incomplete due to a saturation of the glycosylating enzymes. The extremity of the carbohydrate moiety of the secreted proteins does not contain quantitatively the terminal sialic acid. The addition of genes coding for glycosylating enzymes improves the quality of the secreted proteins [14, 15] . Moreover, human cells synthesize sialic acid under the NANA (N-acetylneuraminic acid) form as do rabbit and chicken cells [16, 17] whereas ruminant cells synthesize also the N-glycosylneuraminic acid [18] .

The glycosylation of proteins is essential for the activity of some proteins. Non-glycosylated proteins have a short half-life in vivo. Unexpectedly, a peptide which is a candidate to become a vaccine against malaria looses its capacity to vaccinate mice under a glycosylated form [19] . This exemplifies the necessity to control glycosylation of recombinant vaccines in some cases.

In one case, for the preparation of a vaccine against hepatitis B, animal cells are used and provide a vaccine essentially similar to this obtained with yeast.

Although efficient, CHO cells remain a costly and poorly flexible system to prepare recombinant proteins. Indeed, a 100,000 l fermentor costs 400 million dollars and five years are needed to build such a tool.

The first transgenic plants were obtained in 1983. Apart from their use for basic studies, transgenic plants are increasingly used to improve food production. The idea of using transgenic plants as the source of recombinant proteins has become a reality. A number of enzymes used for research or for diagnosis are currently being produced at an industrial scale.

Producing pharmaceuticals in plants is a more ambitious project. This system offers several advantages but also serious limits [20] . Various plant species can be obtained as transgenics. Two essential methods are implemented to transfer genes to plants. One of these tools is the Agrobacterium tumefaciens system which contains a natural vector able to transfer a foreign gene into the plant genome. The other known as biolistics consists of projecting minute bullets covered by DNA into plant cells. In both cases, viable plants are developed from transformed somatic cells. A large number of transgenic plants can be obtained making it possible the selection of those in which the transgene is intact and functional.

Foreign proteins may be stored in leaves, in seeds, or both according to the promoter used. Leaves are very abundant but it may be difficult to purify the protein of interest from them due to the presence of proteases or substances like polyphenol, which are not well-tolerated by patients.

The amount of recombinant proteins which can be prepared in plants is virtually unlimited and the production cost is low. Moreover, agriculture techniques offer a great flexibility for scaling up. Leaves or seeds containing the proteins of interest can be stored easily. It is also simple to rescue the plant lines and establish master banks allowing a reproducible production of proteins.

Plant cells are able to fold proteins and associate subunits as those forming antibodies essentially as efficiently as animal cells. On the contrary, plants cells add carbohydrates to protein chains but not as animal cells do. Proteins synthesized in plant cells have no terminal sialic acid and they contain xylose, which may induce deleterious immune response. Experiments are in progress to modify protein glycosylation by transferring various genes responsible for the addition of sugars to proteins in a way similar to mammalian cells [21] .

Proteins prepared from plants have very little chance to contain pathogens for humans or animals. Using transgenic plants to prepare recombinant proteins raise little ethical problems. One major concern is the uncontrolled dissemination of the proteins thus of the antigens when plants are cultured in open fields [22] . Low amount of antigens might induce a tolerance in humans or a basal unknown vaccination. This problem cannot be solved easily. Plants may be sterile to prevent any dissemination of the transgene. Another proposition which has been retained by companies involved in the production of recombinant proteins by plants is to limit the gene transfer to plants not used for human feeding such as tobacco or alfalfa [23] . This does not stop completely the uncontrolled diffusion of the antigen. One possibility to suppress the problem consists of keeping the plants in greenhouses. This is technically possible but would enhance markedly the production cost reducing the attractiveness of plants for this purpose.

A satisfactory approach could be to use plants, which can be cultured easily in large quantity and at a low cost in confined areas. Encouraging experiments have shown that duckweed and microalgae could provide humans with large amount of proteins produced in perfectly well-controlled conditions [24] .

Another possibility would be to use cultured plant cells. Recent studies suggest that this perspective offers attractive alternative in some cases [25] .

Several antigens potentially to be used for vaccination have been produced in transgenic plants. The capsid protein VP6 of rotavirus has been found in tubers and leaves of transgenic potatoes [26, 27] . The amount of VP6 was 0.01% of soluble tuber proteins in the first case and 0.02% and 0.06% in tubers and leaves in the second case. Oral immunization with tuber tissues generated measurable titers of both anti-VP6 IgG in serum and IgA in intestine. This proof of concept is insufficient to conclude that this method may contribute to a vaccine.

A fragment of S protein from SARS virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) was found in transgenic tomato and nicotine-free tobacco. Oral administration of transgenic tomatoes to mice induced synthesis of IgA antibodies suggesting that mucosal immune response was triggered after oral administration. Parenteral administration of transgenic tobacco to mice was followed by the presence of IgG antibodies in serum [28] .

The protein G of the rabies virus was obtained in tobacco at the concentration of 0.38% of soluble proteins. Intraperitoneal injection of tobacco extract in mice in the presence of complete Freund adjuvant induced a total protection against the virus [29] .

To produce anti-hepatitis B vaccine at a lower price, the antigen was produced in transgenic potatoes. The viral protein was directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by adding to the cDNA a signal peptide and the KDEL signal. Retention of the antigen in the reticulum was observed. Oral immunization of mice in the presence of cholera toxin induced the secretion of a high-antibody titer, which was still increased by boosting with parenteral administration of the potato extract [30, 31] . The retention of the antigen in the reticulum may have played the role of a bioencapsulation and favored the immune response.

The synthesis in transgenic rice of epitopes known to induce a tolerance toward Japanese cedar antigen was achieved. The rice extract given orally to mice inhibited Th2-mediated IgE responses to the antigen [32, 33] .

Recently, a system called magnifection was shown to allow the rapid production (within two weeks) of gram of functional antibodies in plants [34] . This system involves the transient high-level co-expression of the transgenes (for example immunoglobulin heavy-and light-chains) through the use of plant viruses vectors delivered by Agrobacterium to the plant body.

Although encouraging, these results cannot predict when or if recombinant vaccines prepared from transgenic plants will be able to reach the market.

The first transgenic animals were generated in 1980 and the idea of using these animals as the source of recombinant proteins was proposed two years later when the giant mice having high concentration of growth hormone were obtained. In 1985, it was shown that the DNA microinjection used to generate transgenic mice could be extrapolated to rabbits, sheep and pigs. The use of farm transgenic animals to produce recombinant proteins appeared realistic and the choice of milk as the vehicle was made in 1986. One year later, two proteins were produced in the milk of transgenic mice. This proof of concept was followed by the industrial development of the method. Only in 2006 one protein, human antithrombin III, has been approved by the European agency EMEA to be on the market. In the mean time a large part of the technical obstacle has been crossed. These problems are (i) the establishment of transgenic lines (ii) the secretion of the foreign proteins at a high level (iii) the purification of the recombinant proteins and (iv) the validation of the proteins as therapeutics on a case by case basis.

The generation of transgenic farm animals may be achieved according to species by DNA microinjection into embryo pronuclei, by using lentiviral vectors or transposons, by incubating sperm with DNA followed by in vitro fertilization using ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), by transferring the foreign gene into pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells or primordial germ cells) followed by the generation of chimeric animals harboring normal and transformed cells, by transferring the foreign gene into somatic cells and by the generation of cloned animals using nuclear transfer. These methods have been described in recent reviews [35] [36] [37] . They are summarized in Fig. 1 .

Microinjection into pronuclei is very poorly efficient in ruminants and some other species. It is still being used successfully in mice, rats, rabbits, pigs and fish. To increase the integration frequency, foreign genes can be introduced in integrating vectors such as transposons and lentiviral vectors. The latter proved highly efficient in ruminants and pigs. This technique is being adopted by experimenters even if these vectors have limited capacity to harbor foreign DNA and if the integration number is presently difficult to control.

DNA transfer via sperm has been developed mainly in pigs and mice. It may simplify transgenesis in some cases.

The utilization of cells as carrier for the foreign genes has been used in mice for almost twenty years. In this case, pluripotent cells capable of participating to the development of chimeric transgenic animals are being used. This method is laborious and used only for gene targeting and in practice essentially to inactivate genes (gene knockout).

For unknown reasons, it has not been possible to obtain and use pluripotent cells from embryos (ES cells: embryonic stem cells) in species other than mice. A recent study has shown that in chicken and quails it was possible to establish pluripotent cell lines (EG cells) from the pluripotent cells which are present in fetal gonads (PGC: primordial germ cells). This made it possible the generation of transgenic birds, which are candidates to produce recombinant proteins in egg white.

The cloning technique used to generate Dolly the sheep is being used to generate transgenic ruminants and pigs. This technique allows gene addition but also gene targeting by homologous recombination. This makes it possible gene knockout. Gene targeting is also a way to integrate foreign genes in genomic sites known to favour their expression.

The generation of transgenic animals remains relatively laborious and costly but it is no more a hurdle to the production of recombinant proteins.

Milk is presently the most mature system to produce recombinant proteins from transgenic organisms [38] . Blood, milk [38] , egg white [39, 40] , seminal plasma [41] , urine and silk gland [42] and insect larvae hemolymph [43] are other theoretical systems ( Table 2) . Silk gland is a promising system in particular cases. Preliminary results indicate that active human factor VII can be found in different tissues of a transgenic fish (tilapia). It is not known if this system may be improved and scaled up (McLean unpublished data). Blood cannot store high levels of recombinant proteins most of the time. Moreover, proteins in blood may alter the health of the animals. Milk avoids essentially these problems. Several mammalian species (rabbits, pigs, sheep, goats and cows) are currently being used to produce recombinant proteins in their milk. Rabbits offer a number of advantages: easy generation of transgenic founders and offspring, high fertility, relatively high milk production, insensitivity to prion diseases, and no transmission of severe diseases to humans. Pigs are more costly but produce higher amounts of milk than rabbits. Ruminants are potentially the most appropriate species to produce large amount of proteins but they need cloning or lentiviral vectors to integrate foreign genes, their reproduction is relatively slow, they do not glycosylate proteins as well as rabbits and pigs and they are sensitive to prion diseases. Until recently, egg white was considered as a promising system strongly limited by the great difficulty of generating transgenic birds. This difficulty appears now surmounted. Lentiviral vectors proved efficient in chicken. More impressively, pluripotent cell lines have been established in chicken and quail. These cells harboring foreign genes can be reintroduced in early embryos and participate to the development of chimeric transgenic animals [40] . In a previous experiment, the same group showed that chimeric transgenic chicken generated by using non-pluripotent cells was able to secrete a monoclonal antibody in egg white. This antibody was functional but a reduced half-life due to the lack of sialic acid in the terminal end of the carbohydrate chain [39] . These experiments validate egg white as a source of foreign proteins including recombinant vaccines. 

To be expressed in a reliable manner, a transgene must ideally contain a promoter, enhancers, insulators, introns and a transcription terminator [36, 44] . Expression in milk is achieved successfully with promoters from milkprotein genes. Expression in egg white is possible using the potent promoter of ovalbumin gene. Using long-genomic DNA fragments containing the promoter of interest generally enhances greatly the expression of foreign cDNA. This proved to be the case for the promoter of one milk-protein gene, WAP gene (Whey Acidic Protein) [45] . This suggests that elements from long-DNA fragments will be used in future to construct compact vectors expressing transgene in a reliable manner.

Constructing an efficient expression vector to produce a therapeutic protein is not a standard operation. Two examples may illustrate this point. Recombinant vaccines against malaria are presently under study [46] . One of the proteins was initially obtained in mouse milk [19] ; it is now being produced in goat milk. Unexpectedly, the antigen produced in mouse milk lost its vaccinating properties when glycosylated.

The second example is the production of VP2 and VP6 proteins from rotavirus in transgenic rabbit milk [47] . Rotavirus has a genome formed of several independent RNA fragments. This virus is replicated in cytoplasm and its proteins are not individually secreted. The following modifications of the VP2 and VP6 nucleotide sequence were performed: elimination of the slicing sites and of several N-glycosylation sites, addition of a peptide signal and adaptation of codons to optimize the expression of the two cDNAs in the mammary gland of the animals. The modified cDNAs were introduced into a vector designed according to the criteria defined above [44] . These gene constructs made it possible the co-secretion in milk of the two viral proteins at concentration up to 500 mg/ml. These proteins were able to protect mice against the virus completely or partially according to the mode of administration (see below).

A number of experiments have shown that the posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins secreted in milk may be incomplete. This indicates that the cellular machinery of mammary gland is not sufficient to mature completely proteins when they are secreted at a high level. Experiments carried out several years ago showed that human protein C found in mouse milk was only partly cleaved. This maturation process was complete in transgenic mice expressing furin gene coding for a cleavage enzyme [48] . This pioneer work indicates that living fermentors such as mammary gland can be engineered to perform the posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins.

Identifying and producing vaccinating proteins can be a long and difficult task. But once it is done, other important challenges need to be achieved.

Choosing a suitable adjuvant to enhance the immune response against vaccine antigens together with choosing the right way to deliver the vaccine in recipients are critical for its efficiency. Most of the recombinant proteins or subunit vaccines are poorly immunogenic by themselves compared to whole killed or live-attenuated pathogens. They lack important features commonly present in pathogens like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or unmethylated CpG-containing-DNA that are able to activate the innate immune system and shape the adaptive immune response. For toxicity reasons, whole killed or attenuated pathogens cannot be used in many cases. Adjuvants are then needed to increase the immunogenicity of the subunit vaccines. The common role of adjuvants is to enhance the immune response to weak antigens, and they also are implicated in the orientation of the response to a defined type: cellular or humoral, Th1-or Th2-biased response. The field of adjuvant research is very active and several new candidates are being developed and tested in animals and humans. In addition, the choice of formulation and vaccine delivery is crucial to induce an appropriate protective immune response (local or systemic). It should also be easy to handle and in the best case be needle-free and non-invasive to avoid pain and requirement for sterile material and trained medical workers (this is especially important for vaccines targeting developing countries). The following section summarizes the recent advances in these fields.

Despite extensive evaluation of several candidates over the past few years, the aluminum-based mineral salts (also called alum) are the only adjuvants approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use. Alum is well tolerated and presents a good safety record. However, it is a relatively weak adjuvant for antibody induction against recombinant vaccines. It induces mainly a Th2 immune response and is not efficient for activation of cellular immunity (Th1) [49] . Thus alum adjuvant is suitable when antibody-based protective immunity is required (for example induction of neutralizing antibodies), but alum lacks the ability to induce mucosal IgA. This can impede efficiency of several vaccines where a strong mucosal immunity is needed to prevent pathogen entry and replication into host. This is for example the case for rotaviruses that replicate in the intestine causing severe gastroenteritis, and for which intestinal IgA were shown to protect against disease [50] . Other limitations of alum adjuvants are increased IgE production, allergenicity and neurotoxicity [49, 51, 52] . Alum also cannot be effective in some vaccine formulations [49] . Despite its extensive use for many years, alum mechanism of action is not completely understood. Adsorption of antigens onto alum results in the formation of a depot at the site of injection. The particulate structure of the alum/antigen complex may facilitate uptake by antigen presenting cells and alum could activate complement and macrophages [49] . The saponin Quil A, derived from the bark of a Chilean tree, Quallaja saponaria, or purified extracts none as QS-21 have been evaluated as alternatives to alum for cell-mediated responses activation. The observed toxicity (local reactions, hemolysis) associated with these adjuvants renders their use in humans limited to life threatening diseases like cancer or HIV infection [53] .

Immunostimulatory complexes (ISCOMS) are adjuvants composed of hydrophobically associated cholesterol, phospholipids and quillaja saponins that form a stable cage-like structure in which the antigens can be enclosed [54] . ISCOM-based vaccines are able to induce strong antibody and cellular immune response. It has been shown with a number of different antigens in several animal models including non-human primates (reviewed in [55] ). In mouse, ISCOM-based vaccines were shown to be potent inducers of Th1 immune responses, contrarily to aluminum-based vaccines. In non-human primates, strong long-lasting CD4+ and CD8+ responses were observed following immunization with the core protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) complexed to the ISCOMATRIX (a preformed ISCOM preparation) in addition to humoral responses [56] . The mechanism of action of ISCOM is not fully understood. It is believed that because of their particulate structure their uptake by antigen-presenting cells is more efficient. The saponin component also has potent adjuvanticity (see above), and it has been shown that ISCOM activate the innate immune system through an IL-12-dependent mechanism [57] .

In humans, a number of clinical studies were conducted with different vaccine-based ISCOM (reviewed in [55] ). Antibody and/or cellular responses were induced in most of the recipients, and faster antibody responses of higher intensity were observed in people vaccinated with an influenza/ ISCOM-based vaccine [58] . ISCOM-based vaccines have been administered to several recipients and showed to be safe with low reactogenicity. Common adverse events were reaction at the site of injection and myalgia of mild intensity and of short duration. ISCOMS appear to be interesting candidates for human use. In particular, the ISCOMATRIX adjuvant has been well characterized and appears to be stable and easy to handle [55] . Finally, ISCOMS benefit from robust and reproducible manufacturing procedures that can be scaled up for industrial production.

CpG dinucleotides-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) possess adjuvant activity and were shown to be efficient in different vaccine formulations in animals and humans. CpG ODN are currently evaluated in clinical trials in humans in the field of infectious diseases, cancer treatment and asthma/allergy. CpG ODN are very potent at orienting the immune system toward a Th1-biased response and can therefore be of primary interest for vaccines where a Th1-biased reaction is needed to achieve protective immunity. Furthermore, CpG ODN are able to stimulate mucosal immunity. CpG ODN even showed greater efficiency when administered with other adjuvants like alum or in formulation like lipid emulsions or nanoparticules, which can be necessary to induce a protective response when the antigen is weak. Studies in mice showed that CpG ODN can boost both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against a broad range of proteins or vaccines. For example inclusion of CpG ODN in a SARS coronavirus subunit vaccine composed of a fragment of the spike protein in alum, increased IgG2a titers (representative of a Th1-like response) and interferon-g (INF-g) secreting cells [59] . The same observations were reported with several other subunit vaccines against different pathogens (hepatitis A and B virus [60] [61] [62] [63] , herpes virus [64] and rotavirus [65] ).

The exact mechanism of action of CpG ODN is not precisely elucidated, but it is known that CpG ODN act mainly through activation in the innate immunity. The innate compartment of the immune system evolved to recognize general structures commonly found on a broad range of pathogens. These include the structure of the bacterial and of many viruses DNA, which unlike vertebrate genomic DNA, contain a high proportion of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Bacterial and other pathogens DNA can be recognized directly by the innate immune system through the interaction with the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) which, in humans, is present in B-cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). In mice, TLR9 is also expressed in monocytes and in myeloid dendritic cells. The effect of TLR9 activation is the induction of a proinflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-a) and a Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune response (reviewed in [66] ). CpG ODN mimic the presence of bacterial DNA and primarily trigger activation of the innate immune system. CpG ODN are rapidly internalized by immune cells where they are bound by TLR9. The TLR9 activation caused by CpG ODN administration can enhance antigen-specific humoral or cellular immune response against co-administered antigens. Contrarily to humans, TLR9 in mice is not only expressed in B-cells and pDC but also in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. This observation renders difficult the extrapolation of the encouraging results obtained in mice to humans because these cells may play important roles in vaccination efficiency. However, data obtained from clinical trials in humans showed efficacy of CpG ODN adjuvants. Coadministration of CpG ODN with hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) to healthy adult volunteers, either alone or in combination with alum, resulted in increased IgG titers compared to the control group receiving Engerix-B alone [67] . Furthermore, hepatitis B-specific surface antigen antibodies appeared earlier when immunizations were carried out with CpG [67, 68] . Inclusion of CpG adjuvant also increased the proportion of antigen-specific high-avidity antibodies [69] . An accelerated antibody response combined with increased magnitude and avidity was also observed when healthy volunteers were immunized with the anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) when CpG ODN were included [70] . So far, treatments with CpG ODN were well tolerated, and the adverse effects observed among recipients only included pain and erythema at the site of injection, and mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that did not last and did not impede daily life activities [66] . Taken together, these results underline the potential of CpG ODN adjuvants both in animals and humans. Although more studies are needed and important points remain to be addressed (like the possibility to induce autoimmune diseases in recipients [66] ), CpG ODN appear to be promising tools. Interestingly, CpG ODN could benefit from the large-scale -good manufacturing practices -industrial production technologies developed during the past few years for the antisens drug development (which have been approved by the US FDA) [71] .

Two bacterial toxins were identified as powerful mucosal adjuvants: the cholera toxin (CT) and the related heat labile enterotoxin (LT) produced by Escherichia coli. Both toxins consist of a catalytic subunit A (CTA or LTA) associated with a pentameric cell-binding B subunit. CTA and LTA subunits possess an ADP-ribosyl transferase enzymatic activity resulting in permanent adenylate cyclase activation in targeted cells, increased cAMP production and hypersecretion of salt and water into the bowel [72, 73] . The CTB and LTB parts allow the binding to cell surface through their association with GM1 gangliosides, which result in the internalization of the toxic A subunit. These toxins are internalized by polarized epithelial cells and it is thought that co-administered antigens may follow the same route. These toxins induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses and increased responses against co-administered antigens. Vaccinations with CT and LT as adjuvants produced Th1 and Th2 responses. They showed excellent efficacy in inducing protective immunity when administered via the nasal and rectal route and to a lesser extent via the oral route [65, 74, 75] . However, the strong toxicity of these molecules precludes their use in humans (ingestion of 5 mg of CT in human would result in the induction of a 5-l watery diarrhea). Several less toxic derivatives that retain adjuvanticity were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutants comprise the LT K63, LT R72 and LT R192G forms of LT. The LT K63 and LT R72 bear single amino acid substitutions in the catalytic A subunit. Both mutants differ in the residual enzymatic activity, which positively correlates with their adjuvanticity. LT R192G contains a single amino acid substitution in a protease sensitive portion of the catalytic A subunit [76] . This mutant with reduced enterotoxicity shows great adjuvanticity when delivered mucosally either by the nasal, oral or rectal route [10, 74, 75, 77] . Interestingly, intranasal delivery of antigens in combination with CT, LT or its derivatives induces mucosal responses even at distant sites. When rotavirus virus-like particles (VLP) were administered intranasally, strong mucosal and systemic responses were induced together with intestinal IgA production [74, 78] .

Encouraging results were obtained using a strategy consisting of fusing the enzymatically active A subunit of CT to a B-cell-targeting moiety (D) of Staphylococcus aureus protein A. This adjuvant, called CTA1-DD, is far less toxic than the intact CT and contrarily to CT produces a balanced Th1/Th2 response [79] . It was also shown to give comparable protection against rotavirus infection when compared with LT R192G or CpG [80] . Furthermore, in mice receiving a nasal administration of the universal influenza vaccine M2e-HBc combined with CTA1-DD, a complete protection against a lethal infection was observed, together with a reduction of morbidity, in the context of a Th1-type immunity [81] .

The B subunits of CT (CTB) and LT (LTB) could also serve as mucosal adjuvants. CTB and LTB contain adjuvant activity when administered by the nasal route. Mice vaccinated with an influenza virus vaccine with LTB showed higher systemic and mucosal antibody responses than mice receiving the vaccine alone [82] . Interestingly, recent study showed that the fusion of CTB to CpG ODN (CpG-CTB) resulted in an enhancement of the immunostimulatory effect of CpG ODN, with a more potent stimulatory effect of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses in human and mouse splenocytes [83] .

It is worth being mentioned that in addition to CT and LT (and their derivatives), a third toxin called Zonula occludens toxin (Zot) showing adjuvant activity has been identified [84] . Zot is a single polypeptide chain encoded by the filamentous bacteriophage CTXF and expressed by Vibrio cholerae. Zot binds a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells and increases mucosal permeability by acting on the structure of epithelial tight junctions. This phenomenon is believed to allow penetration of antigens into the tissue where they can interact with immune cells. It is also possible that Zot does not only act as a co-delivery system for antigens but may also have immunomodulatory properties by activating antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, the effect that Zot exerts on tight junctions is reversible and does not cause tissue damage.

Several other bacterial toxins having adjuvant activity have also been identified and studied by different groups (reviewed by [85] ) but their mechanisms of action still need to be clarified.

Monophosphoryl lipid A LPS is a major constituent of the Gram-negative bacteria. LPS are considered to be endotoxins and induce strong pro-inflammatory reaction. LPS have strong adjuvant properties but excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to repeated administration of LPS leads to endotoxin shock characterized by inflammation, profound hypotension and organ failure [86] . Because of this elevated toxicity, LPS cannot be used in humans. An LPSmimetic compound called monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), exhibiting adjuvanticity and low toxicity has been generated. MPL, like LPS act by interacting with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on antigen presenting cells resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and INF-g, which will ultimately enhance the adaptive immune response (humoral and cellular). In preclinical studies, MPL has been shown to generate Th1-type immune response to antigens [87] . The molecular mechanisms resulting in the lower toxicity of MPL versus LPS are not clear; but recently, Okemoto and collegues [88] showed that contrarily to LPS, MPL activation of macrophages does not result in the release of IL-1b (a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine involved in the endotoxin shock [89] ), nor the activation of caspase-1 (also involved in the induction of endotoxin shock).

MPL adjuvant, or synthetic analogue components (RC-529) formulations have often been used in clinical trials in combination with alum and QS21 [90, 91] . The adjuvant designated AS04 composed of an association of alum salts with MPL has been shown to increase antibody responses against a papillomavirus subunit vaccine in humans [92] . This formulation also led to a long-lasting immunity to the vaccine (at least 3.5 years), and an increase of memory B-cells when compared to alum salt only formulations [91] [92] [93] .

More than 12,000 subjects received MPL-formulated vaccines for herpes virus [94] , hepatitis B virus (HBV) [95] , papillomavirus [91] [92] [93] ) and extensive clinical data are available for this adjuvant. In addition, MPL is presently approved in Europe for use in combination with allergy vaccines [96] .

At present different strategies are developed to optimize antigen stability and bioavailability in the host. Most of them rely on the entrapment of the antigens into polymer-based particles in the case of microspheres, or into lipid-based membranous vesicles in the case of liposomes. Microspheres are composed of biodegradable polymers, mainly polylactide (PLA) or poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The polymers degrade in vivo to form non-toxic lactic and glycolic acids. Administered microspheres allow controlled antigen release: it may form a depot at the site of injection, allowing the slow release of the antigen for extended periods. It can thus minimize the number of doses required for immunization. Liposomes are bilayered vesicles composed of phospholipids and other sterols surrounding an aqueous center where the antigens can be entrapped. Liposomes allow for prolonged release times of antigens.

Microspheres and liposomes present several advantages like increased resistance to degradation of the antigens in the gastro-intestinal tract, controlled antigen release minimizing the number of doses, particle uptake by immune cells, and ability to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocytes responses.

Adjuvants can also be entrapped in the particles to enhance immune responses against delivered antigens and one may include this type of formulation to increase vaccine efficiency.

The choice of site of vaccine delivery is particularly important. Usually, vaccines are delivered by the parenteral route (either by subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection). This immunization regimen often leads to induction of systemic immune responses and circulating antibodies but a poor mucosal immunity. This type of immunization is suitable when serum neutralizing antibody induction is needed to prevent pathogens to replicate or to reach their target cells in the host. This is for example the case for HBV vaccine delivered parenterally by injection, where neutralizing antibodies mediate protection. However, it is generally considered that in order to produce protective immunity it is best to vaccinate via the natural route of infection of pathogens. Most pathogens infect hosts via the mucosal epithelium that represents 90% of the body surface: respiratory tract (respiratory syncitial virus), gastrointestinal (enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus), vaginal (papillomavirus, HIV) or rectal mucosa (HIV). At present, a great challenge for vaccination is to stimulate a strong mucosal immunity to prevent pathogen entry into host.

The easiest way to administer a vaccine is through oral delivery. However some limitations do exist. These include degradation of the antigens in the harsh gastrointestinal environment (acidity, bile salts and pancreatic secretions), and induction of oral tolerance to the antigens. One major feature of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is the homing of circulating activated B-cells at distant effector sites from the site of induction [97] . This feature allows, for example, for the production of intestinal or vaginal IgA after intranasal immunization [74, 78, 98] . Intranasal immunization has been widely used in mouse and is recognized as a very potent induction site for protective immunity in a number of cases. However, this immunization strategy may not be well adapted for humans. Indeed, the nasal epithelium is in close contact with the olfactory bulb and the central nervous system (CNS). The close vicinity of these structures renders the intranasal delivery of bacterial toxin-based adjuvants a dangerous approach for mass vaccination since toxins and co-administered antigens could penetrate the CNS [99, 100] , (and see also NIAID July 9, 2001 meeting summary at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ research/topics/enteric/meetings.htm).

Alternative immunization sites could be used to overcome this problem, for example the vaginal or the intrarectal delivery of antigens. The latter has recently been shown to be efficient for vaccination against the enteric pathogen rotavirus [65, 75, 119] . Recently the transcutaneous route has been shown to stimulate mucosal responses [101, 102] .

Mucosal immunization offers a number of important advantages including non-invasive (needle-free) easy administration (intranasal, oral or intra-rectal/vaginal) of vaccines. It can also be conceived that mucosal vaccines could be self-delivered without the use of sterile equipment (syringes) and trained medical workers, which may be a real advantage for vaccination in developing countries.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious, non-replicating analogues of pathogenic viruses. VLPs are formed in vitro by the self-assembly of viral capsid proteins. A number of VLPs from different viruses have been described to date like papillomaviruses, rotaviruses, Norwalk viruses, hepatitis B and E viruses, and parvoviruses to name a few. Some of them are used as vaccines (papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus). The repetitive structure of the arranged capside proteins in VLPs (as in native virus particles) favors activation of B-cells and antibody production [103] [104] [105] . Some VLPs can also efficiently activate cytotoxic T-cell responses in the absence of infection and intracellular replication [106] [107] [108] [109] . VLPs are attractive tools to present foreign epitopes to the immune system. Some chimeric VLPs have been described for hepatitis B virus [110] [111] [112] , hepatitis E virus [113] , rotavirus [75, 114] , and parvovirus [115] among others.

HBV VLPs consisting of the fusion of HCV epitopes to the HBV core protein have been used in mice immunization. Both anti HBV and anti-HCV epitope responses were observed [116] . HBV VLPs were also used to carry large polypeptides like GFP (Kratz) or the ectodomain of the outer surface protein A (OspA) from Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. HBV/OspA hybrid VLPs immunization could protect mice against challenge with Borrelia burgdorferi [111] . In another study, inclusion of a B-cell epitope tag into hepatitis E virus (HEV) VLPs induced specific antibody responses against both the VLP and the B-cell epitope. Sedlik et al. showed that porcine parvovirus VP2 capsid protein carrying a CD8+ T-cell epitope from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein retain its capacity to assemble into VLPs. Immunization of mice with these hybrid VLPs resulted in strong cytotoxic T-lymphocytes responses against the CD8+ epitope and protected mice against a lethal challenge with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [117] . It is important to mention that in some of these experiments, vaccinations were successfully conducted without the use of adjuvant, underlining the immunostimulatory effect of VLPs on the foreign epitopes.

Thus, combining the presentation of antigens in an immunogenic repetitive structure (like VLPs) with the use of powerful adjuvants should result in increased efficiency of immune system activation against otherwise poorly immunogenic soluble antigens. This approach could be a nice strategy for the elaboration of combined multivalent vaccines, presenting the advantage of vaccinating against both the carrier (VLP) and the introduced epitopes.

Recombinant vaccines have well-identified theoretical advantages over conventional live vaccines. Yet, recombinant vaccines remain scarce. Vaccine against hepatitis B is one of them. A vaccine against RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) is also used to vaccinate rabbits. An efficient vaccine against poultry Newcastle disease has been prepared in transgenic plant and approved but not put on the market so far [118] . No more than four plantderived recombinant vaccines have reached clinical development [20] . The vaccine against malaria produced in goat milk is under clinical study whereas the vaccine anti-rotavirus produced in rabbit milk is under preclinical study.

Identifying a relevant antigen capable of becoming efficient is the result of a relatively long-term study. Yet, such antigens have been characterized and could be prepared. Validating a mode of administration and determining the valuable adjuvant require specific studies on animal models. Such models are not always relevant. Mice are most frequently used species for this purpose. These animals often give only limited information. Infection by rotavirus is not followed by diarrheas. Other species not so easily used such as pigs or monkeys are then required.

The different systems for the production of recombinant vaccines have been markedly improved during the last decades. Additional progress is expected but the state of the art in this field is no more a hurdle. About 475,000 l of animal cell fermentors are available and could contribute more extensively to the production of recombinant vaccines. Production in the yeast Pichia pastoris is getting more and more efficient and reliable.

Transgenic plants are still facing important problems. The production level remains often low. The glycosylation problem is not expected to be solved in a near future and the uncontrolled dissemination of antigens may not find solution other than the implementation of confined areas. The only marketed proteins produced in plants are enzymes for industrial applications. Two proteins only are under clinical study, dog lipase for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and a monoclonal antibody directed against Streptococcus mutans and preventing tooth decay [118] and none of them has been approved yet.

The production in milk is the most mature system and is available to produce reliable recombinant vaccines at a low cost. The spectacular advance for generating transgenic chicken and for expressing monoclonal antibodies in egg white (3 mg per egg) suggest that this system will soon contribute to boost the production of recombinant proteins in transgenic animals. The fact that Atryn (human antithrombin III) produced in goat milk has been approved by EMEA contributes companies and investors to be more confident in transgenesis to produce biopharmaceuticals.

Technical gaps cannot therefore account for the slow development of recombinant vaccines. Economical reasons are the major limitation in this field. It is important to note that the vaccines all included are at the eighth position in the classification of the biopharmaceuticals [118] . The vaccine business is in the hand of five major companies, which focus their effort on influenza and childhood diseases. The demand of vaccines including recombinant vaccines remains relatively modest as these biopharmaceuticals require relatively a high investment in research. The amount of product to be prepared is relatively low. Vaccination is a preventive operation. This implies a very low level of risk. The price of vaccines is expected to be low, especially when they are to be used in developing countries. The recent rotavirus vaccines are being used in several countries despite the risk of intussusceptions as the risk due to the vaccination is significantly lower than the risk of infection.

Recombinant vaccines appear to be a better tool than conventional vaccines in a number of cases. Their development might become more rapid during the coming decade as, in an increasing number of countries, governments recommend or require systematic vaccination for entry of children into schools. Recent world epidemics such as SARS or influenza incline government to support the development of new vaccines. The threat of bioterrorism is going in the same direction.

The development of recombinant vaccines thus depends on political decision but technical improvements are still needed to improve the efficiency of recombinant vaccines and to lower their production cost.

Monoclonal antibody-based therapies for microbial diseases NIH Public Access Author Manuscript,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) revolution that currently provides many new options for the treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases has largely bypassed the field of infectious diseases. Only one mAb is licensed for use against an infectious disease, although there are many in various stages of development. This situation is peculiar given that serum therapy was one of the first effective treatments for microbial diseases and that specific antibodies have numerous antimicrobial properties. The underdevelopment and underutilization of mAb therapies for microbial diseases has various complex explanations that include the current availability of antimicrobial drugs, small markets, high costs and microbial antigenic variation. However, there are signs that the climate for mAb therapeutics in infectious diseases is changing given increasing antibiotic drug resistance, the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy is available, and development of mAb cocktail formulations. Currently, the major hurdle for the widespread introduction of mAb therapies for microbial diseases is economic, given the high costs of immunoglobulin preparations and relatively small markets. Despite these obstacles there are numerous opportunities for mAb development against microbial diseases and the development of radioimmunotherapy provides new options for enhancing the magic bullet. Hence, there is cautious optimism that the years ahead will see more mAbs in clinical use against microbial diseases.","The field of infectious diseases has largely missed the monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutic revolution of the past decade. In contrast to such fields as oncology and rheumatology where mAbs have provided new effective therapies, only one mAb has been licensed for the treatment of an infectious disease [1] . This omission in the anti-infective armamentarium is particularly distressing given that the therapy of infectious disease is in crisis, since it is arguably the only field of medicine where effective intervention options have declined [2] . The crisis in infectious disease therapeutics is a consequence of four simultaneous developments, that in combination have significantly reduced treatment options for certain microbial diseases: 1) widespread antimicrobial drug resistance; 2) an epidemic of immunocompromised hosts in whom antimicrobial therapy is not as effective as in hosts with intact immunity; 3) the emergence of new pathogenic microbes for which no therapy exists; and 4) the re-emergence of older pathogenic microbes, often in drug-resistant form, as exemplified by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The reticence for adopting mAb therapies against infectious diseases is intriguing given that antibody therapies were the first effective antimicrobials. In the early 20th century serum therapy was used against a diverse range of infectious diseases, including pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, erysipelas, anthrax and others [3, 4] . These successes established antibody therapy as a powerful tool against infectious disease. Unfortunately, the immunological complications associated with the use of heterologous sera in humans, such as serum sickness and immediate hypersensitivity, significantly limited its usefulness [4] . Importantly, the problems of serum therapy do not necessarily apply to mAb therapy. Technological developments, such as improved purification techniques and the ability to engineer humanized mAbs, have greatly reduced these complications, allowed for increased specificity and expanded the range of possible targets. However, for many infectious diseases the availability of antimicrobial therapy has proved to be too much competition, and that combined with the complexity of introducing mAbs to clinical practice has hindered the pace of mAb-based therapeutic advancements.

Despite its current underdevelopment, the potential of antibody therapy in the form of mAbs is vast, especially for combating microbes that are resistant to antibiotic therapy, for emerging viral diseases or for the organisms or toxins responsible for bioterrorist threats. We believe that mAbs are well poised to be important reagents in a new age of antimicrobial therapy [2, 5] . In this review, we focus on mAbs for infectious diseases and note that several recent reviews have addressed the topic of antimicrobial immunoglobulin therapy [6] [7] [8] . Our goal is to review the state of the field and to identify areas where the development of mAb-based therapies may be particularly valuable.

The prophylactic and therapeutic potential of immune serum was discovered by Behring and Kitasato, who showed that passive transfer of antibody from the blood of infected animals could provide immunity to diphtheria [9] . Their work led to the first instance of industrial production of protective serum from sheep for human therapy in 1893 [10] and to the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for Behring. Immune animal sera from horses, sheep, and chickens were used to treat diseases where a protective immune response could be induced in the animal host by vaccination. In cases where humans were the only hosts, such as viral diseases, human convalescent sera were successfully used.

For example, in the early 1900s, serum from individuals who recovered from measles was used to treat and prevent infection. Until the 1930s, serum from animals or people was collected and pooled to treat a number of infections, from streptococcal infection to toxin-mediated diseases like diphtheria [11] . Overall, serum was effective, and for some diseases like pneumococcal pneumonia and meningococcal meningitis, the prompt administration of serum was associated with significantly improved survival [3] .

However, despite these successes, the discovery of antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s rapidly replaced serum therapy. Antibiotics were easier to manufacture, had less toxicity in patients and produced more consistent results. In contrast to serum therapy, which depended on animal sources that exhibited great lot-to-lot variation, antibiotics were the products of industrial processes and could be formulated in preparations with consistent activity. Furthermore, serum therapy was generally effective only early in the course of infection while antibiotic therapy maintained efficacy even when given late in the course of a microbial disease. Another advantage of antibiotic therapy was that it could be used without a specific diagnosis while the use of antibody therapy required knowledge of the pathogen responsible for disease.

Consequently, serum therapy was unable to compete with antibiotics, and the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy displaced antibody-based therapies (Table 1) .

Despite the general abandonment of serum therapy for bacterial diseases, certain niches developed where it continued to be used, such as the prophylaxis and treatment of a small number of viral and toxin-mediated diseases for which there were no alternative therapeutic options. This point is important because it illustrated that antibody therapy can thrive in certain situations where it lacked competition, such as in the treatment of diseases which have no other effective therapies. For example, antibody preparations continue to be used to prevent rabies and toxicity from snakebite venoms. In developed countries serum therapy was often replaced by hyperimmune serum from pooled human donors. Today, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin is used to treat many diseases including those caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis virus (VZV), and measles, underscoring the fact that antibody therapy remains an effective means of treatment [6, 12] .

Compared to hyperimmune sera, or even to modern antibiotics, mAb therapy has many advantages and some disadvantages (Table 1) . mAbs inherently have a high specificity for their target and, since microbes are generally antigenically distinct from humans, the crossreactivity with host tissues is minimal. In contrast to antibiotics, which target both harmful microbes and the host flora, mAbs will only target a specific microbe and their systemic administration should not affect other resident beneficial microbes. This could prove to be a significant advantage given increasing reports associating certain chronic diseases such as asthma, atopy, and even certain forms of cancer with antimicrobial drug use [13, 14] . Microbial specificity means that mAbs are unlikely to select for drug-resistant microbes among nontargeted microbes. The ability to specifically target disease-causing microbial populations without selecting for resistance makes mAb therapy potentially superior to current broadspectrum antibiotics that are generally used in therapy, at least for microbial diseases caused by single microbes. The increasing prevalence and rising cost of treating methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and other resistant infections in both nosocomial and community settings emphasizes the need to develop new strategies for controlling infections.

Serum therapy by definition uses immune sera-derived immunoglobulins that are polyclonal preparations consisting of many types of antibodies of which only a minute fraction is specific for the intended microbe. In contrast, mAb preparations consist of one type of immunoglobulin with a defined specificity and a single isotype. This represents both an advantage and a disadvantage when mAbs are compared to polyclonal preparations. One advantage is that mAbs, by virtue of the fact that they are chemically defined reagents, exhibit relatively low lot-to-lot variability in contrast to polyclonal preparations, which can differ over time and by source of origin since different hosts mount different antibody responses. Another advantage for mAb preparations is a much greater activity per mass of protein since all the immunoglobulin molecules are specific for the desired target. This phenomenon is illustrated by the report that two 0.7 mg doses of two mAbs provided the same protection against tetanus toxin as 100-170 mg of tetanus immune globulin [15] . However, mAb preparations lack variability with regards to epitope and isotype, and consequently polyclonal preparations have potentially greater biological activity by targeting multiple microbial epitopes and providing various effector functions through different isotypes.

With the development of human and humanized mAbs, the toxicity of these agents is also relatively low. Current technology makes the production of mAbs relatively easy and effective, requiring only tissue culture or microbial expression systems, as opposed to the live human or animal donors that were required for serum therapy. Hence, the potential toxicity of human and humanized mAbs is comparable to antibiotics and lower than serum therapy, especially heterologous preparations. mAb therapies are also much less likely to inadvertently transmit other infectious diseases. However, antibody therapies remain very costly relative to antimicrobial drugs. Consequently, mAbs are unlikely to successfully compete with antimicrobial drugs against diseases for which cheap effective therapy is available unless a clear superiority is established for the immunoglobulin therapy alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial therapy. The fact that specific antibodies are often synergistic with conventional antimicrobial therapy suggests that combination therapy with current antimicrobial regimens may confer potential advantages relative to either alone [16, 17] . Not only can mAbs make antibiotics more effective, but the research driving mAb development can also enhance other areas, such as identifying new targets for vaccine development [18, 19] . In this regard, efforts to develop mAb-based therapies have the potential of impacting many aspects of infectious disease medicine. Furthermore, some mAbs can be effective in immunocompromised hosts, as evidenced by the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing hospitalizations for RSV-associated disease in preterm infants [20] . Even in the setting of reduced immune response, mAbs can function to replace lost immunity or benefit the host by direct activity, such as neutralization. Consequently, mAbs are an attractive alternative alone or as adjuncts to current antimicrobial therapy that will be effective in hosts with different states of immunity.

Despite these strengths, mAb therapy has some inherent limitations. The cost factor has already been alluded to and remains a major obstacle to widespread mAb use. Antibodies are macromolecules that are fragile, perishable and require refrigeration, each of which contributes to their high cost. Furthermore, most mAbs require systemic administration, which complicates their delivery in many clinical settings. Finally, a mAb usually cannot be used until a specific diagnosis is made. In an era when broad-spectrum antibiotics are relied upon so heavily, treatment is often begun before diagnostic identification of a disease-causing microbe is made [5] . However, recent advances in rapid diagnostic techniques provide hope for earlier specific diagnosis, which is essential for making mAb treatments more realizable. Even so, based on experience with serum therapy, one could anticipate that a mAb will only be effective when administered relatively early in the course of infection. A decrease in antibody efficacy over time occurs quickly as the duration of infection increases, highlighting the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

Another, theoretical drawback to mAb therapy is that these reagents, by definition, target a single epitope, and provide one type of effector function corresponding to their isotype. Although the specificity of mAbs is a strength, a microbe that undergoes rapid antigenic variation poses a significant hurdle for mAb development. For example, the high mutation rate of certain viruses enables them to escape neutralization. There are numerous examples in the literature where experimental mAb therapy has resulted in the emergence of escape variants as a result of microbial mutation and/or microevolution [21] [22] [23] . This problem may be counterbalanced by selecting mAbs that target conserved areas of viral particles or by using mixtures of mAbs that target various epitopes. For example, combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses including influenza [24] , coronavirus [25] , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [26] . Although cocktails are effective in providing protection against the emergence of resistant mutants, the inclusion of multiple immunoglobulins in any therapeutic formulation is fraught with complex regulatory and licensing issues. Nevertheless, progress in overcoming these burdensome regulatory issues is evidenced by the recent development of a mAb mixture for the prophylaxis of rabies that targets several virus types [27] . Indeed, as polyclonal sera may be beneficial due to the presence of multiple protective antibodies, a cocktail of functional mAbs could provide more protection and target more microbial strains than a single one. As experience with mAb cocktails accumulates it may be possible to design therapeutic combinations that include multiple effector functions in the form of different isotypes and epitope specificities.

Even in the face of these obstacles, mAb therapy is booming in other areas of medicine, with over 20 in clinical use, representing a market that is expected to reach $20 billion by 2010 [28] . The majority of approved mAbs treat cancer, autoimmune or allergic conditions, where they have shown considerable success and spawned a mAb 'gold rush' [29] . The antigenic differences between the host and the microbe make mAb development for infectious diseases easier than for cancer or immunity fields, where the target is often a self-antigen that is differentially expressed in transformed cells. Additionally, mAbs have direct and indirect antimicrobial mechanisms of action. Direct mechanisms include neutralizing toxins or binding to viruses to prevent host cell entry. Recently mAbs have also been shown to be directly bactericidal [30] . Indirect mechanisms involve Fc-mediated functions, such as modulation of the inflammatory response, promoting opsonic phagocytosis, and enhancing complementmediated effects. This wide array of functions makes mAbs potentially useful against a variety of infectious diseases.

Despite these advantages, there is currently only one licensed mAb for an infectious disease, and understanding its success is instructive for the possibilities inherent in this approach. The humanized mAb palivizumab, brand name Synagis®, binds the RSV F protein and is effective for the prevention of severe respiratory disease in high-risk infants and immunocompromised adults [31] . It received regulatory approval in 1998. Prior to palivizumab, prophylaxis of RSV disease depended on RespiGam, or RSV-IGIV, a prophylactic polyclonal RSV hyperimmune serum [1] . This prior polyclonal preparation was plagued by low specific activity, and effective dosing required the administration of large volumes of antibody, which was problematic in low weight infants. Palivizumab obviated this problem since it had 50-fold greater potency than the polyclonal serum, and this example shows how greater specific activity can translate into a superior product. The greater potency significantly reduced the volume needed to deliver a therapeutic dose to an infant and has improved treatment while avoiding the side effects of pooled serum.

In our view opportunities for the development of mAbs include niches where their use would bring a large therapeutic benefit relative to existing therapies. Although there are many diseases where mAb therapy could make a major contribution (see below) the economics are not favorable in each instance. In this regard, the exquisite specificity of antibody-based therapies means necessarily smaller markets than broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. This combined with the relatively high costs of producing and delivering immunoglobulin therapies can make the market analysis of many reagents not economically viable. However, for microbial diseases with inadequate therapeutic options, antibody-based therapies are likely to be competitive, provided that the disease prevalence is of sufficient size to create a tenable demand.

It is noteworthy that even for diseases where there is currently adequate antimicrobial therapy, new developments could make mAb more attractive. For example, consider the case of antibiotic prophylaxis against Group B streptococcus (GBS) neonatal sepsis. Mothers carrying GBS are routinely treated with antibiotics and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in neonatal disease. However, antibiotic therapy affects the infant microflora and has been epidemiologically linked to the development of atopy and asthma in children [14] . Furthermore, prophylactic antibiotic therapy can select for resistant microbes or disturb the flora in a manner that could make colonization with resistant microbes more likely, could be followed by superinfections, and may even have untoward consequences later in life [5] .

Passive antibody therapy against GBS is also effective [32] and not encumbered by the problems of altered flora and its consequences. Hence, the economics of passive antibody and antibiotic prophylaxis are more nuanced than simply valuing the different alternatives. A truer cost comparison must take into account the complications that follow broad-spectrum therapy.

Historically, the major targets for antibody therapy have been diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria (e.g. pneumococcus and meningococcus), toxins (e.g. diphtheria and tetanus) and viruses. In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future. Our goal is to survey this field, with the understanding that cataloguing all ongoing efforts is beyond the scope of this article.

Viral targets are particularly attractive because for most viruses there is no specific therapy. The potential for mAbs to be used as neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral binding and entry to host cells makes them a good platform for prophylaxis, preemptive or acute treatment of viral illnesses [34] . There are several current areas of viral mAb development, and many in clinical trials (see Table 2 ).

While the approved drug palivizumab is effective against RSV disease in susceptible groups, there has been considerable effort to develop 2 nd and 3 rd generation mAbs: motavizumab (brand name Numax®) and Numax-YTE® [1] . Motavizumab was engineered to have increased affinity through induced somatic hypermutation, with the hopes that increased binding will improve function in humans, and is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials. Numax-YTE is the result of additional efforts to prolong this mAb's serum half-life, another potential avenue of mAb development. Furthermore, clinical trials are underway testing both escalating doses of mAb and intramuscular (i.m.) administration, showing that the improvement of delivery and dosing of mAb drugs are an important next step in advancing therapy. These developments illustrate how technological advances may improve existing successful mAb therapeutics.

HIV has always been an area of great interest for mAb therapy [35] [36] [37] [38] . There are several mAbs for HIV in development, designed to inhibit viral entry, reduce viral load in HIV-patients, and potentially to prevent infection in certain cases [39, 40] . Viral entry inhibitor mAbs target either the cellular receptors, CCR5 and CD4, or the cognate viral protein gp120. Efforts to develop neutralizing mAbs with broader strain specificity have found success targeting the V3 loop of gp120 [41] . As is true with all mAbs designed for infectious disease, the development of a successful vaccine would reduce their need. However, given the slow progress on the front of HIV vaccine development, mAb research in the HIV field is a promising alternative. Although there are numerous antiretroviral drugs available for the treatment of HIV, the availability of effective mAb therapy could complement chemotherapy by slowing the onset of resistance and possibly enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

Another target for mAb development is CMV. Sevirumab is currently being assessed for treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected individuals and neonatal congenital CMV. Another important complication of CMV infection is reactivation disease, a distinct burden on transplantation medicine. CMV infects a large portion of the population, at least 60% of adults in the U.S., and the virus can reactivate with devastating consequences during the course of immunosuppression that solid organ or hematologic transplant patients must undergo [42] . The use of mAb to control this reactivation is an area of development that could benefit a large number of patients.

Hepatitis B and C infections are areas where antibody therapies offer great hope in helping to control disease and improve transplantation success. Hepatitis remains the leading indication for liver transplant, and viral reinfection of the transplanted liver is a major complication. Two different monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials for the improving transplant success, of which neither are specific for the virus itself. Both bavituximab, specific for phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid exposed on membranes of damaged cells, and MDX-1106, specific for PD-1, an inhibitory T cell costimulation receptor, have been used to control chronic hepatitis infection, particularly in the setting of HIV-coinfection [34, 43] .

The threat of a new pandemic makes influenza virus an important candidate for mAb development, with research currently being done to characterize human neutralizing antibodies and explore their therapeutic potential [24, 44, 45] . Historically, influenza virus has been extremely challenging because of its high antigenic variability. However, progress has been made in identifying antibodies that are broadly neutralizing [46, 47] . In the event of a new pandemic mAbs could provide important options for disease control since they confer immediate immunity and may be used as prophylaxis for individuals who are likely to have been exposed to infection. Considerable excitement followed the discovery of a broadly crossreactive antibody specific for HA2 of influenza A that allows the neutralization of different viral strains, including avian H5N1 and human H1N1 [48] . Technology now exists where plasma cells secreting influenza-specific antibody can be cloned from human donors and used to generate high affinity mAbs within a matter of weeks [49] .

Another promising opportunity for antibody therapy is rabies, where current standard of care depends on administration of immune globulin and vaccination. In this regard, a major innovation was the development of the mAb cocktail CL184 [27] . This cocktail is comprised of two mAbs, specific for two different epitopes of the rabies virus, and shows good neutralizing activity in vitro and was well tolerated in patients. Its success validates the idea that cocktails of multiple mAbs represent an important logistical improvement in mAb therapy, allowing for expanded target coverage, broader specificity and a wider range of effector functions.

There is no available vaccine or specific therapeutic agent for human flaviviral infections, and after the outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1999, efforts were directed towards developing antibody therapies for prophylactic treatment [50] . A hyperimmune preparation derived from human convalescent sera protected mice from West Nile virus (WNV), both in the setting of induced immunocompromise and after the onset of encephalitis [51] . This observation suggested that antibody was effective at treating disease after dissemination to the brain and spinal cord had occurred. Development of mAb treatment for WNV in elderly or immunocompromised patients might prevent the debilitating disease and paralysis that can occur in these populations [52] . MGAWN1, a humanized mAb to the structural envelope protein, is currently in clinical trials, and could provide a new therapeutic option against WNV.

The ability to rapidly identify microbial targets and produce mAbs makes them a feasible tool to combat emergent situations. An excellent example of the rapidity with which mAbs can be generated in response to an outbreak was provided by the response to SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV). In early 2003, respiratory disease due to the virus broke out in human populations, and within a year the cellular receptor [53] and viral glycoprotein [54] responsible for binding were identified. By early 2004, neutralizing human mAbs had been developed and were being tested by laboratories [55] , illustrating the potential speed of bench-to-bedside transition. Human mAbs have been developed to the Hendra and Nipah viruses, which are both paramyxoviruses that can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers and were responsible for outbreaks in the late 1990s [56, 57] . Emerging diseases are just one area where research into the specificity of mAb targets and their protective efficacy in animal models should be a priority. Other areas where mAbs targeting a needed pathogen may be in development but have not reached clinical trials yet are listed in Table 3 .

Bacterial diseases mediated by toxins have historically responded to specific antibody and consequently remain good targets for treatment with toxin-neutralizing mAbs. In addition to toxin-mediated diseases, recent studies have shown that specific mAbs can alter the course of bacterial and fungal infection, and that immunoglobulins can enhance the action of other antimicrobials. The issue of mAb synergy with conventional antimicrobial drugs is of particular importance since development of mAbs as an adjunct to existing therapy is an attractive possibility to improve therapeutic outcomes for bacterial infection. Several mAbs, targeting diseases that are in clinical trials ( Table 2 ) or being developed as needed therapeutics (Table  3) , are discussed below.

The Shiga-like toxin IIB produced by pathogenic strains of E. coli is responsible for organ damage in the hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that develop during infection. Outbreaks of the Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 are often linked to contaminated food and can be potentially fatal. Treatment of HUS is complicated, because antibiotics can potentially worsen the disease [58, 59] . Several mAbs designed to neutralize the systemic toxin have been developed, and one is currently having success in Phase I clinical trials [60] [61] [62] .

Another toxin-mediated disease of growing concern is C. difficile colitis, which usually results from broad-spectrum antibiotic use [63] . Although oral antibiotics can often clear infection, there are indications that new hypervirulent strains are emerging, which increase disease severity [64] . Furthermore, for certain individuals the disease can become chronic [65] . mAbs to toxin A and toxin B are in development and currently being tested in clinical trials. Laboratory research has shown that mAbs may act by more than just direct binding and neutralization of toxin, as Fc receptors have been shown to be essential for mAb protection, presumably through increasing endocytic uptake of the toxin by effector cells [66] . The increasing prevalence and toll of this disease underscores both the dangers of antibiotic use and the potential for mAb as a new therapy platform. mAbs may become essential tools to fight this and many other hospital-acquired infections, where often antibiotics have already failed to improve outcomes [67] . Staphylococcal disease is an example of bacterial disease where both the bacterium and disease-mediating toxins can be targeted by mAbs. Two mAbs in clinical trials recognize staphylococcal virulence factors. Pagibaximab is a chimeric mAb specific for lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which was shown to be protective against both coagulasenegative staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus infection [68] . Certain populations are very susceptible to staphylococcal disease, such as very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns, where pagibaximab is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for preventing infection [69, 70] . Another target is the S. aureus protein clumping factor A (ClfA), targeted by tefibazumab (brand name Aurexis®) which is in phase II clinical trials for S. aureus bacteremia [71] . These two mAbs show promise and provide hope for the development of improved mAbs targeting staphylococcal species. Alphahemolysin (H1a) is a pore-forming cytotoxin that is an essential virulence factor for the development staphylococcal pneumonia. Researchers have recently shown that passive administration of a mAb to H1a, as well as vaccination to elicit active immunity against this antigen, afforded protection to pneumonia in mouse models [72] .

Antibodies neutralizing toxins and viruses can provide immediate defense against many biological weapons [73] . Anthrax is an example of one such disease, where current treatment recommendations are inadequate, as the anthrax vaccine is currently not indicated for postexposure prophylaxis and antibiotic-resistant strains of B. anthracis are a rising concern [74] . Protective antigen (PA) is the common subunit to the two dimeric anthrax toxins, where PA pairs with edema factor (EF) or lethal factor (LF) to form cellular toxins mediating edema and cell death, respectively. The two mAbs specific for PA currently in clinical trials are Anthim, which was just announced to be restarting phase I clinical trials, and raxibacumab, which is currently maintained by the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. Toxins from C. botulinum are another example of extremely potent neurotoxins that can lead to fatal respiratory disease and are capable of being weaponized. Development of mAbs to neutralize these toxins for postexposure treatment is an important avenue of research.

One area where antibody therapy has long provided the only therapeutic option is the neutralization of snake venoms. Most of the current preparations fall into the category of serum therapy, with immunoglobulins derived from heterologous sources. One group has developed human single chain variable antibody fragments (HuScFv) from a phage display library that are effective in neutralizing the neurotoxin and preventing lethality in mice [75] , illustrating how new mAb technology and antibody formats are able to improve and expand on current treatments. However, economics could pose a formidable problem with developing mAbs venom therapy, since the number of different poisons is great and, fortunately, the number of cases is relatively few.

Fungal diseases are a promising area for mAb therapy. Fungal diseases are chronic, difficult to treat, and carry a high mortality and morbidity despite antifungal therapy. For this group of diseases mAb therapy could find a niche because current therapies are suboptimal. To date only one mAb has been studied clinically for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis [76] . That antibody reduced serum cryptococcal antigen but only at very high doses, which made it economically unfeasible. An antibody fragment to a surface heat shock protein showed promising efficacy against human candidiasis in a Phase III trial [16] . Recently a broadly crossreactive mAb to a fungal cell wall antigen was described that was effective against experimental aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis [77, 78] . Another example of broadly active antifungal mAbs are those that mimic killer toxin action [79] .

The exquisite specificity of antibodies for their targets provides a means of delivering harmful cargo to their targets. This concept has long been recognized in oncology where investigators have tried to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor antibody therapies by conjugating antibodies to bacterial toxins and radioisotopes. Like use of mAb therapy in general, the field of infectious diseases has been slow in adopting such strategies, although considerable experimental work was done to develop immunotoxins to target HIV infected cells [80] . Nevertheless, in recent years progress has been made developing radioimmunotherapy for infectious diseases.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) was first developed for cancer treatment almost three decades ago [81] . RIT uses the antigen-antibody interaction to deliver radionuclides that emanate lethal doses of cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells [82, 83] , and can provide a valuable alternative to chemotherapy and external radiation beam therapy (EBRT). RIT is a successful therapy for certain cancers as evidenced by the recent approval of mAb-based drugs such as Zevalin® and Bexxar® (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with 90-Yttrium ( 90 Y) and 131-Iodine ( 131 I), respectively) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recent reports on the use of RIT as an initial treatment for follicular lymphoma [84] are encouraging thus making RIT first line therapy in some types of cancer.

Until recently the potential of RIT as an antimicrobial strategy had not been explored. The reasons for this are enigmatic but could reflect the lack of awareness of the difficult problems in clinical infectious diseases by the nuclear medicine community and of RIT by the infectious diseases community. During the last 5 years RIT has been successfully adapted in our laboratories for the treatment of experimental fungal, bacterial and viral infections [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] .

Here we briefly review the data on efficacy and safety of RIT of infectious diseases.

The potential efficacy of RIT against an infectious diseases was first established using C. neoformans (CN) [85] . CN is a major fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in 6-8% of patients with AIDS. CN provided a good system to study the potential usefulness of RIT because there were excellent animal models available, well characterized mAbs to CN antigens existed, and immunotherapy of CN infection with capsule polysaccharide-binding antibody 18B7 was already in clinical evaluation [76] . In spite of high level of circulating polysaccharide in the blood of infected mice, in both pulmonary and systemic animal models of CN infection radiolabeled mAb preferentially localized to the sites of infection. mAb 18B7 radiolabeled with 213-Bismuth ( 213 Bi) or 188-Rhenium ( 188 Re) killed CN cells in vitro, thus providing the basis for in vivo experiments in AJ/Cr mice infected systemically with CN. Mice treated with radiolabeled CN-specific mAb 18B7 lived significantly longer than mice given irrelevant labeled IgG1 or PBS. Mice infected with CN and given RIT had significantly reduced fungal burden in lungs and brains 48 h after treatment compared to infected mice in the control groups.

The antimicrobial RIT approach was subsequently extended to another human pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) [86] , which is the most common cause of fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [91] , by treating HC in vitro with 188 Re-labeled mAb 9C7 (IgM) which binds to a protein antigen on the surface of the HC cell wall [92] . Ninety percent of HC cells were killed with 32 µCi HC-specific 188 Re-9C7 mAb. In contrast, incubation of HC with a radiolabeled control IgM with the same specific activity produced only minimal killing within the investigated range of doses. Cellular dosimetry calculations based on the mean absorbed dose to the cell showed that RIT with alpha-and beta-emitting radioisotopes was approximately 1,000-fold more efficient in killing CN and approximately 100-fold more efficient in killing HC than gamma radiation.

The potential of RIT against bacterial infection was established using Streptococcus pneumoniae because this is an important extracellular pathogen, and there are good animal models and mAbs available [88] . A greater percentage of mice treated with 213 Bi-D11 survived relative to the control groups, where mice in control groups succumbed to bacteremia on day 1-3, while mice treated with 80 µCi 213 Bi-D11 mice demonstrated 87-100% survival. Treatment with radiolabeled D11 was very well tolerated as no weight loss was observed in treated animals.

RIT could also be potentially effective against chronically infected cells including those with viral infections [6] . In contrast to RIT of fungal and bacterial diseases where the target is the microbe itself, in RIT of viral infections the infected mammalian cells would be targeted thus providing a general strategy for eliminating reservoirs of infected cells and viral cellular factories. This approach could be developed for the treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains [93] . The efficacy of RIT for treatment of HIV infection in vivo was explored with a radiolabeled HIV envelope-specific human anti-gp41 mAb 246-D radiolabeled with 213 Bi and 188 Re [89] . For these studies human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with HIV-1 JR-CSF were injected into the spleens of SCID mice and the mice were treated with RIT. Treatment of mice with 188 Re-labeled mAb 246-D administered either before or after intrasplenic injection with HIV-1 JR-CSF -infected human PBMCs dramatically reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells. Similar results were obtained after treatment of mice with 213 Bi-246-D. Administration of equivalent amounts of ""cold"" mAb 246-D or of a radioisotope-coupled irrelevant control mAb did not reduce the average number of infected cells detected in the SCID mouse spleens. The demonstration of efficacy of RIT against HIV provided a proof-of-principle for the concept of treating viral infections by targeting viralinfected cells and this approach could potentially be applied to other chronic viral diseases like hepatitis C.

The success of RIT approach in laboratory studies combined with earlier nuclear medicine experience on pre-clinical and clinical studies showing the utility of radiolabeled organismspecific antibodies for imaging of infections (reviewed in [94] ) provides encouragement for the feasibility of therapeutically targeting microbes with labeled antibodies. In fact, the ability of specific antibody to localize to a site of infection provides strong support for the potential usefulness of this technique as a broad antimicrobial strategy. It might be possible to create a so-called ""pan-antibody"" which would recognize an antigen shared by a particular class of human pathogens. An example of such a ""pan-antibody"" is mAb 6D2 initially developed against fungal melanin that also binds to synthetic, invertebrate (cuttlefish), murine and human melanins [95] . The availability of such antibodies would eliminate the necessity of having antibodies specific for each particular microorganism and would enormously enhance the development of RIT of infectious diseases.

Considering the breadth of research into new targets for microbial mAbs, as well as the vast need for new therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases, this area of medicine is a growing field. There are many new approaches to improving the efficacy of mAbs, such as using cocktails of mAbs or combining mAbs with existing drugs for synergistic effects. There are also many new research developments that will expand the possibilities for mAb drugs. The next generation of mAbs could be developed against novel targets, such as quorum sensing molecules, which regulate bacterial growth and virulence factor expression [96] , or type III secretion systems, which are used by a subset of microbes to infect host cells [97] . To fight MDR bacteria, some successful approaches have targeted the cellular efflux pumps responsible for antibiotic resistance [98] . In general, more of these types of ""broad-spectrum"" mAbs will enable a therapeutic mAb to be developed which could be useful against a number of microbes, thus extending its market and increasing its profit potential. Bavituximab is an example of one such mAb, specific for phospholipids on the exposed inner surface of damaged cells, where potential applications include both HIV and HCV [34] . Progress has also been made generating mAbs that have bispecificity, where mAb variants are selected that bind to multiple microbial epitopes [99] . Finally, more direct engineering of mAbs could result in enhanced efficacy, such as Fc region alterations that can extend serum half-life or influence effector function [100] . For example, alterations in Fc region glycosylation can increase antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [101] . Although this review has focused on the use of intact mAbs against microbial diseases, we note that for some microbes the Fc region is not necessary for efficacy, providing numerous additional therapeutic options. For example, mAb fragments which lack Fc regions can be effective in situations where effector cell function is not necessary, for example in inhibiting HIV entry [102] .

We are cautiously optimistic that the mAb therapeutic revolution will make a much greater impact against microbial diseases in the years ahead. There is no shortage of targets for mAbs to treat microbial diseases. At this time, the major problem is economic and it is likely that success will come first in niche areas where there is sufficient need, urgency, and market size to support the development of mAb therapies. In the longer term, the field needs to build economic models that are suitable for the development of antibody therapies against a much broader set of microbial targets.

Vascular disrupting agent DMXAA enhances the antitumor effects generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines,"Antigen-specific immunotherapy using DNA vaccines has emerged as an attractive approach for the control of tumors. Another novel cancer therapy involves the employment of the vascular disrupting agent, 5,6dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). In the current study, we aimed to test the combination of DMXAA treatment with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 DNA vaccination to enhance the antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. We determined that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. We then found that combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, the DMXAA-mediated enhancement or suppression of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination was found to be dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA and was also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines. In addition, we determined that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration before DNA vaccination. Our study has significant implications for future clinical translation.","Advanced stage cancers are difficult to control using conventional therapies such as chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Therefore, new innovative therapies are urgently required in order to combat the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancers. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. DNA vaccination has become a potentially promising approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy due to its safety, stability and ease of preparation (for review, see [1, 2] ). We have previously developed several innovative strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency by directly targeting the DNA into the dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo via gene gun as well as by modifying the properties of antigenexpressing DCs (for review see [3, 4] ).

One of the strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency uses intracellular targeting strategies to enhance MHC class I/II antigen presentation and processing in DCs. Previously, we have studied the linkage of calreticulin (CRT), a Ca 2+ -binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (for review, see [5] ) to several antigens, including human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 [6, 7] , E6 [8] , and nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [9] . Intradermal administration of CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and impressive antitumor effects. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.

Another novel cancer therapy involves the employment of the vascular disrupting agent, 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). Vascular disrupting agents are a new class of potential anticancer drugs that selectively destroy the established tumor vasculature and shutdown blood supply to solid tumors, causing extensive tumor cell necrosis (For reviews see [10, 11] ). DMXAA is a synthetic flavonoid that induces the production of local cytokines including TNFα. DMXAA has been shown to induce antitumor effects in animal models, especially in combination with established anticancer agents. It has demonstrated a good safety profile and has been shown to be promising in phase I clinical trials [12] .

In the current study, we aimed to test the combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination to enhance the antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. We also aimed at exploring the appropriate regimen and the mechanism of action of this drug. The clinical implications of the current study are discussed.

Mice C57BL/6 mice (5-to 8-week-old) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). 5-8 weekold inducible nitric oxide synthase deficient (iNOS -/-) and wild-type control C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). 5-8 week old TNFα-/-and wild-type control C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY). All animals were maintained under specific-pathogen free conditions, and all procedures were performed according to approved protocols and in accordance with recommendations for the proper use and care of laboratory animals.

The H-2K b restricted HPV-16 E6 peptide, YDFAFRDL (E6 aa50-57), and the H-2D b restricted HPV-16 E7 peptide, RAHYNIVTF (E7 aa49-57) were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Denver, CO) at a purity of ≥70%. FITCconjugated rat anti-mouse CD4, CD8, IFN-γ and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). DMXAA was dissolved in 5% sodium bicarbonate, and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight.

HPV-16 E6 and E7-expressing TC-1 tumor cells were generated as previously described [13] and was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μM non-essential amino acids and 0.4 mg/ml of G418.

The generation of HPV-16 E7-expressing plasmid (pcDNA3-CRT/E7), E6-expressing plasmid (pcDNA3-CRT/E6) [8] , PADRE-expressing plasmid (pcDNA3-IiPADRE) [14] , and vaccinia virus encoding HPV-16 E7 (SigE7LAMP1) [15] , has been described previously.

Mouse tumor challenge model C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were injected with 1 × 10 5 TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously at the flank site in 100 μL PBS. Tumors were measured twice a week. Tumor volume was estimated using the formula 3.14 × [largest diameter × (perpendicular diameter) 2 ]/6.

Preparation of DNA-coated gold particles and gene gun particle-mediated DNA vaccination was performed using a helium-driven gene gun (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) according to a protocol described previously. Gold particles coated with pcDNA3 encoding HPV-16 E6 or HPV-16 E7 or PADRE were delivered to the shaved abdominal region of mice using a heliumdriven gene gun with a discharge pressure of 400 psi. Mice were immunized with 2 μg of the various DNA vaccines and received boosts with the same regimen as indicated in the figure legends. For vaccinia encoding SigE7LAMP1 vaccination, 1 × 10 7 pfu viruses were injected intraperitoneally in 100 μl volume. Splenocytes were harvested 1 week after the last vaccination.

Before intracellular cytokine staining, pooled splenocytes from each vaccination group were incubated for 20 hours with 1 μg/ml of the HPV-16 E6 aa50-57 peptide, or HPV-16 E7aa49-57 peptide, or PADRE peptide at the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The stimulated splenocytes were then washed once with FACScan buffer and stained with PE-conjugated monoclonal rat antimouse CD8a (clone 53.6.7). Cells were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Intracellular IFN-γ was stained with FITC-conjugated rat antimouse IFN-γ. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSCalibur with CELLQuest software (BD biosciences, Mountain View, CA).

C57BL/6 mice were treated with DMXAA at 20 mg/kg via i.p. injection. 48 hours later, splenocytes were harvested and apoptosis of T cells were analyzed by staining splenocytes with annexin V staining kit from BD Pharmingen according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.

Bio-Plex cytokine assay 5~8 week-old C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with 2 μg of pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA via gene gun delivery. 3 days after the vaccination, the mice were treated with either 20 mg/kg of DMXAA or buffer via i.p. injection. Mouse serum was collected 5 hours later and stored at -80°C until assay. Mouse cytokines were analyzed using Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay from Bio-Rad according to manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was assayed in duplicate.

Data expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD) are representative of at least two different experiments. Comparisons between individual data points were made by 2-tailed Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice

To determine the antitumor effects of treatment with DMXAA, we first challenged groups of C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) with TC-1 tumor cells and treated them with a single dose of DMXAA which was administered on day 13 after tumor challenge via i.p. injection and monitored the tumor size over time. As shown in Figure 1A , tumor bearing mice treated with DMXAA showed significantly lower tumor volumes over time compared to tumor bearing mice without DMXAA treatment (* p < 0.05). We also characterized the E7-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses in these mice. One week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. However, as shown in Figure 1B , we found that mice treated with DMXAA were not capable of significantly enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to mice without DMXAA treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice.

Combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice

In order to determine the therapeutic antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune response in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA combined with CRT/E7 DNA vaccination, we first challenged groups of C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) with TC-1 tumor cells and then treated them with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine with or without DMXAA as illustrated in Figure 2A . Seven days after the last vaccination, we harvested splenocytes from vaccinated mice and characterized them for the presence of E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ followed by flow Figure 1 Characterization of antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with 1 × 10 5 TC-1 cells subcutaneously. Mice were treated with a single dose of DMXAA given at day 13 after tumor challenge via i.p. injection. Tumor volume was monitored with calipers twice a week. One week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis.

The data shown here are from one representative experiment of two performed. cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2B , tumor-bearing mice that were treated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine in combination with DMXAA generated the best therapeutic antitumor effects compared to mice treated with any other regimens (* p < 0.05). Furthermore, mice treated with DNA vaccine in combination with DMXAA also generated the highest number of E7-specific CD8 + T cells compared to mice treated with any of the other regimens. Thus, our results suggest that treatment of tumorbearing mice with DMXAA enhances the systemic E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination.

The DMXAA-mediated enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination is dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA In order to determine the optimal regimen for enhancing the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccine using DMXAA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with CRT/ E7 DNA vaccine three times at 3 day intervals via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA at 3 days before the first vaccination (-3), simultaneously (0) or 3 days after the first vaccination (+3) as indicated in Figure 3A . Vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment were used as controls. Seven days after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from vaccinated mice and characterized for the presence of E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 3B , vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after vaccination generated the best E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to any of the other regimens. Furthermore, we observed that vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA at the time of vaccination or 3 days before the first vaccination generated suppressed E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. Thus, our data indicate that administration of DMXAA 3 days Tumor volume was monitored with calipers twice a week. One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis.

after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates significantly enhanced E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in tumor-bearing mice.

In order to determine if the observed phenomenon is also applicable to tumor-bearing mice, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously, vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery, and treated with DMXAA either before the first vaccination (d-3) or after the first vaccination (d+3) as indicated in Figure 4A . One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination (d +3) generated significantly higher E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA before vaccination (d-3) (p < 0.05). We also observed that vaccinated tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA at the time of vaccination or 3 days before vaccination generated suppressed E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment.

Furthermore, tumor-bearing mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination (d+3) generated a significantly increased number of activated dendritic cells compared to the control. In addition, treatment with DMXAA also led to increased expression of co-stimulatory markers for DC activation compared to the control (see Additional File 1; Figure S1 ). The increased number and function of DCs contribute to the enhanced processing and presentation of E7 antigen to the generation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells in treated mice. Taken together, our data indicate that the timing of administration of DMXAA significantly influences the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice.

The DMXAA-mediated enhancement of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune responses generated by vaccination is also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines

In order to determine if the observed enhancement of HPV DNA vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses by DMXAA is also applicable to other antigen- Figure 3A .

One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for antigenspecific T cell immune responses using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 5 , mice vaccinated with the 3 different vaccines (CRT/E6 DNA or Sig/E7/L1 vaccinia virus or PADRE DNA) and treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination all generated the best antigen-specific T cell immune responses ((A) HPV-16 E6-specific CD8 + T cell responses, (B) HPV-16 E7-specific CD8 + T cell responses, and (C) PADRE-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses) compared to any of the other regimens. Thus, our data indicate that administration of DMXAA three days after the first vaccination is capable of enhancing antigen-specific immune responses in different vaccination systems.

In order to determine if additional doses of DMXAA following the first vaccination would further enhance the immune responses generated in vaccinated mice, C57BL/ 6 mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with either one dose or two doses of DMXAA as indicated in Additional File 2; Figure S2A . One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Additional File 2; Figure S2B and C, vaccinated mice treated with two doses of DMXAA after vaccination generated significantly better E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to vaccinated mice treated with one dose of DMXAA. Thus, our data indicate that administration of two doses of DMXAA after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates significantly better E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice compared to administration of one dose of DMXAA.

In order to determine the long-term memory T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination with or without treatment with DMXAA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine three times with 3 day intervals via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA at 3 days after vaccination as indicated in Figure 6A . Sixty days after the last treatment, we harvested splenocytes from vaccinated mice and characterized them for the presence of E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 6B , vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination generated significantly better E7-specific CD8+ memory T cell immune responses compared to vaccination without DMXAA treatment. Thus, our data indicate that administration of DMXAA 3 days after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination enhances the E7-specific CD8+ memory T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice.

In order to determine if co-administration of DMXAA with DNA vaccination will influence the cytokine level in the serum of mice with observed immune enhancement, we characterized the serum cytokine concentration from vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination (see Figure 6A ) using multiplex analysis. As shown in Figure 7 , the cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1β, MCP-1 and RANTES were found to be elevated in vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. These cytokines may potentially play a role in the enhancement of antigen-specific T cell immune responses caused by co-administration of DMXAA with the DNA vaccine.

iNOS plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration at the time of the first DNA vaccination

In order to determine the mechanism by which DMXAA leads to suppressed antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses when administered before or at the time of the first DNA vaccination, we characterized the apoptotic cell death of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in Figure 6A . Sixty days after the first vaccination, splenocytes were harvested and characterized for E7specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. (B) Representative data of intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis showing the number of E7-specific IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells in after DNA vaccination +/-DMXAA treatment.

The data shown here are from one representative experiment of two performed. the splenocytes derived from mice treated with DMXAA. C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were treated with DMXAA at 20 mg/kg via i.p. injection. 48 hours later, splenocytes were harvested and apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by annexin V staining. There was no significant difference in the levels of apoptotic cell death in the CD4+ or CD8+ T cells among splenocytes from mice treated with DMXAA compared to those from the control mice (see Additional File 3; Figure S3 ). Thus, our data suggest that the mechanism by which DMXAA leads to suppressed antigen-specific immune responses is not through T cell apoptosis.

It has been shown that mice treated with DMXAA have been shown to induce iNOS production as well as TNFα in tumors [16] . Furthermore, iNOS and TNFα has been implicated in playing an important role in antitumor immunity (for reviews, see [17] [18] [19] . Thus, in order to further explore the mechanism of action of DMXAA related to iNOS and TNFα, we have used iNOS-/-mice or TNFα-/-mice as well as C57BL/6 WT mice (5 per group) for our study. These mice were vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA either at the time of first vaccination on D0 or 3 days after the first vaccination on D3 as indicated in Figure 8A and 8D. One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from vaccinated mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8 + T cells using intracellular IFN-g staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 8B , while DMXAA led to the suppression of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in CRT/E7 vaccinated WT mice when administered on D0, DMXAA did not suppress the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in CRT/E7 vaccinated iNOS-/mice. This indicates that iNOS is a major factor in the immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA when administered at the time of the first DNA vaccination. On the other hand, vaccinated TNFα-/-mice treated with DMXAA administered on D0 suppressed the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses similar to wild-type mice (see Figure 8C ). We also found that vaccinated iNOS-/-mice or TNFα-/-mice treated with DMXAA on D3 led to enhancement E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses similar to wild-type mice (Figure 8E and 8F). Thus, our data indicate that iNOS, but not TNFα contribute to the observed immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration at the time of the first DNA vaccination.

In the current study, we determined that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. We further found that combination of DMXAA treatment with therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, the DMXAA-mediated enhancement or suppression of E7specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination was found to be dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA and was also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines. In addition, we determined that iNOS plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration before DNA vaccination. Our data are consistent with a recent observation using E7 peptide-based vaccines in an E7expressing cervicovaginal tumor model [20] . In our study, we observed that treatment of tumorbearing mice with DMXAA alone leads to therapeutic antitumor effects without generating antigen-specific immune responses (Figure 1 ). This may be due to the fact that as a vascular disrupting agent, DMXAA has been shown to exert antitumor effects by non antigenspecific mechanisms such as selectively destroying the established tumor vasculature and shutting down blood supply to solid tumors, causing extensive tumor cell necrosis [10, 11] . The release of tumor antigen caused by DMXAA treatment may not be sufficient to generate detectable antigen-specific immune responses. Thus, while DMXAA treatment alone in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice failed to lead to appreciable E7 antigen-specific immune responses, the vaccination with CRT/E7 vaccine can lead to increased number of E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors in tumor-bearing mice, which may be further expanded by treatment with DMXAA, resulting in a significant enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ immune responses in treated mice ( Figure 2 ).

For clinical translation, it is important to determine the optimal regimen for treatment with DMXAA. Our study showed that administration of DMXAA 3 days after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates the best antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice (Figure 3 ). Our data also indicated that administration of two doses of DMXAA after the first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice (see Additional File 1; Figure S1 ). Thus, it will be of importance to further explore the optimal treatment for administration of DMXAA in clinical trials.

Our study explored the mechanism of enhancement induced by DMXAA. We found that DMXAA administered after the first DNA vaccination influences the cytokine profile in the serum of mice with observed immune enhancement (Figure 7 ). Mice treated with DMXAAA after the first DNA vaccination showed upregulation of the cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1β and RANTES. IL-6 can be secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response to trauma, leading to inflammation (for review see [21] ). G-CSF is a cytokine produced by a number of different tissues to stimulate the bone marrow to produce granulocytes and stem cells. KC, MIP-1β and RANTES are chemokines that act as chemo-attractants to guide the migration of T cells. All these molecules are believed to play a role in the immune enhancement generated by DMXAA administration. In additon, our data suggest that treatment with DMXAA 3 days after the first DNA vaccination can lead to enhancement of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5 ). Thus, it is possible that the enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses by DMXAA treatment may also be contributed by both cytokines as well as antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

Our data also suggested that iNOS plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration at the time of the first DNA vaccination (Figure 8 ). Our study also showed that the immune suppression mediated by DMXAA is abolished in iNOS knockout mice. Because DCs are essential for priming of antigenspecific CD8+ T cell immune response, it is conceivable that treatment with DMXAA may lead to the negative impact on DC function, presumably mediated by iNOS. It will be of interest to further characterize the role of iNOS on immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA treatment.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the combination of DMXAA treatment with HPV-16 E7 DNA vaccination can enhance or suppress the antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice depending on the time of administration of DMXAA. These results may have potential implications for future clinical translation.

Clinical and Diagnostic Virology Comparison of monoclonal biotin-avidin enzyme immunoassay and monoclonal time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay in detection of respiratory virus antigens,"Background: Detection of respiratory viruses by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based on monoclonal antibodies were developed in our laboratories in the late 1980s and they have been successfully used in daily diagnosis for more than seven years. Later, similar Biotin-EIAs were developed but the sensitivities were unsatisfactory.","Acute respiratory viral infections are one of the most common causes of seasonal morbidity and of massive absence from work, with resulting economic repercussions. Many groups have reported a number of methods for the rapid diagnosis of such viral respiratory infections (Grandien et al., 1985) as respiratory syncytial virus (Clayton et al., 1987; Obert and Beyer, 1988; Bruckovfi et al., 1989) , adenovirus (Lehtom~iki et al., 1986; Bruckovfi et al., 1989) , influenzavirus (Bucher et al., 1987; Coonrod et al., 1988; Havlickova et al., 1990) , and rhinovirus (A1-Nakib et al., 1989) infections. Moreover, commercially available kits for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus have been evaluated (Freymuth et al., 1986 (Freymuth et al., , 1991 Halstead et al., 1990) .

Our groups have previously developed polyclonal and monoclonal EIAs and TR-FIAs for detecting respiratory viruses directly in clinical specimens (Sarkkinen et al., 1981a, b; Halonen et al., 1983 Halonen et al., , 1985 Walls et al., 1986; Hierholzer et al., 1987 Hierholzer et al., , 1989 Hierholzer et al., , 1990 . These tests have proved to be very successful in diagnostic service. Since 1987, seven respiratory virus TR-FIAs (influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenoviruses) have been used in day-to-day diagnostic service at the Department of Virology, University of Turku, and more than 3000 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens have been tested each year, more than 18,000 altogether. A panel of twelve TR-FIAs has been widely used at CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, for detecting respiratory viruses including parainfluenza 4 and mumps (Hierholzer et al., 1993) , coronavirus types 229E and OC43 (Hierholzer et al., 1994) , and two enteroviruses causing acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (enterovirus 70 and coxsackie A 24 variant) (Hierholzer et al., 1990) .

Previously, all-monoclonal Biotin-EIAs were compared with all monoclonal TR-FIAs and the sensitivity of TR-FIAs was always higher (Hierholzer et al., 1987 (Hierholzer et al., , 1989 . Because time-resolved fluorometry has not yet been widely adapted to diagnostic virus laboratories, we have further optimized the Biotin-EIAs using an identical test format and assay diluent as in TR-FIA, and reevaluated the sensitivities and specificities of these optimized assays. The present report indicates that the monoclonal antibodies which are optimal in TR-FIA are not always optimal in Biotin-EIA, and that the sensitivity obtained with clinical samples is almost identical with these two assays.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (NPA) used in this study were selected from the specimen library in Turku. They were sent to the diagnostic unit mainly from hospitalized children with an acute respiratory infection.

In the laboratory, the NPA specimens were diluted 1:5 in PBS containing 20% inactivated fetal calf serum and 2% Tween 20, then sonicated, and further diluted 1:2 in 0.5% gelatine in 0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.75, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.05% NaN3, 0.01% Tween 40. Then specimens were tested by monoclonal TR-FIA for seven respiratory viruses (Walls et al., 1986; Hierholzer et al., 1987 Hierholzer et al., , 1990 ) and stored at -20°C up to four years. During the storage period the specimens were thawed many times.

Altogether, 257 specimens were included in the study that had been positive when freshly tested: 51 for adenovirus, 51 for influenza A virus, 45 for influenza B virus, 18 for parainfluenza type 1 virus, 15 for parainfluenza type 2 virus, 40 for parainfluenza type 3 virus, and 37 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Moreover, 21 negative NPA specimens, 3 for each virus tested, were tested for the standardization of the tests. All specimens were retested by TR-FIA simultaneously with Biotin-EIA against the appropriate antibody.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in the evaluation of the Biotin-EIA were purified from ascites fluids obtained by intraperitoneal injection of hybridoma cells in pristane-primed BALB/c mice. The hybridoma cell lines employed to produce MAbs and their source are indicated in Table 1 . The adenovirus monoclonal antibodies were anti-hexon, the influenzavirus and the RSV ones were anti-nucleoprotein, the parainfluenzavirus 1 ones were anti-fusion, the parainfluenzavirus 2 and 3 ones were anti-HN. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from ascites fluids by fast anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose FF HR10/10 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as described by Waris et al. (1988) . NaC1 was added to 0.4 M to the clarified ascites fluid and then passed through a column containing 1 ml of Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in 20 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, 0.35 M NaCI, pH 7.7. The sample was collected into a test tube by low-speed centrifugation of the column. The ascites fluid was then passed through a PD-10 prepacked column of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) for desalting to 20mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.7, passed through MiUex-AA and Millex-GV filters (pore size 0.8 and 0.2 mm, respectively) (Millipore, S.A., Molsheim, France) and finally through a Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with 20 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.75. The elution buffer was 20 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.7, with a 160 ml linear gradient of 0 to 0.35 M NaCI. The peak of IgG was collected and the concentration measured spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.4 ml/mg per cm.

Biotinylation of MAbs was done by Enzotin reagent (N-biotinyl-w-aminocaproicacid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) at pH 8.5 according to the manufacturer's instruc- Table 1 Designation and source of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the IgG concentrations used in biotinavidin enzyme immunoassay (Biotin-EIA) and time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) in the detection of adenovirus group-reacting hexon antigen ( Waris et al. (1988) . An aqueous solution of europium chelate (20.7 nmol/ml) was added in a 50-fold molar excess to 1 2 mg of MAbs. The mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight and then passed over a Trisacryl GF-2000 column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.75, to separate the uncoupled europium chelate ions. Bovine serum albumine treated with diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) was added to the labeled IgG to a final concentration of 0.1%. The europium-labeled MAbs were stored in aliquots at -70°C until used.

The concentrations of capture and europium-labeled MAbs were determined in previous experiments (Table 1) . Twelve-well polystyrene microstrips (Eflab Oy, Helsinki, Finland) were coated with 0.5 gg/well of monoclonal immunoglobulin in 200 gl of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Strips were incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing twice with 5 mM Tris-HC1, 0.15 M NaC1, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.75 (TR-FIA wash solution), wells were postcoated overnight at room temperature with 250 lal/well of 0.1% gelatine in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaC1, 0.01% Tween 40. Strips were then used immediately or stored at 4°C for several months. Before use, the strips were washed twice with TR-FIA wash solution. 100 lxl of treated NPS was pipetted into duplicate wells and immediately thereafter 100 gl/well of labeled MAbs diluted in TR-FIA assay buffer (0.5% gelatin, in 0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.75, 0.15 M NaCI, 0.05% NAN,, 0.01% Tween 40, 20 IxM N'-diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)) were added. The strips were incubated 1 hr at 37°C and then washed six times with TR-FIA washing solution. 200 gl of DELFIA TM enhancement solution (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) was added to each well, and the strips were shaken at room temperature for 10 min. Fluorescence was measured with a 1230 Arcus fluorometer (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) and values were expressed as counts per second (cps). The fluorometer was programmed to a previous cut-off value of two times the mean of six negative controls. Specimens were then tested, and the definitive cut-off was calculated adding six times the standard deviation of the negative specimens to their mean. All samples with a cps value over this second cut-off were regarded as positive.

Optimal concentrations of the catching and of the labeled antibody (Table 1 ) were determined in checkerboard titrations against control antigens. Eight-well polystyrene microstrips (Eflab Oy, Helsinki, Finland) were coated with 0.5 gg/well of MAbs in 200 gl of carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The strips were incubated overnight at room temperature and then washed twice in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Wells were postcoated as in TR-FIA. If not used immediately, strips were stored at 4°C for several months. Before use, the strips were washed twice in PBS-T, and 100 gl of NPA was pipetted into duplicate wells. 100 lal of biotinylated MAbs, diluted to the appropriate concentration in assay buffer, were added to each well and the strips were incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, the strips were warmed up to 37°C for 10 min and then washed twice in PBS-T. 200 gl of horseradish peroxidase labeled avidin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:6000 in assay buffer were added to each well and strips were incubated 30 min at 37°C. After washing three times in PBS-T and twice in PBS, 200 gl/well of 1,2-o-phenylenediamine in sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide was added. After 30 rain incubation at room temperature in the dark, the reaction was stopped by adding 33 gl/well of 6 M HC1. The optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm by a Multiskan Plus spectrophotometer (Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland) . Specimens were considered positive if their absorbance values were higher than three times the mean value of negative controls; the minimum cut-off value was 0.250.

Monoclonal antibodies employed in both assays were the same for five out of the seven respiratory virus antigens tested, with the exceptions of parainfluenza type 1 virus and parainfiuenza type 2 virus (Table 1 ) . Since monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA for these two viruses were not satisfactory in Biotin-EIA, other monoclonal antibodies were tested. Clones 253-9D and 251-12A for parainfluenza type 1 virus, and 233-4D for parainfluenza type 2 virus were found to be best in Biotin-EIA.

In the optimization tests, semipurified virus preparations and two TR-FIA positive and three negative specimens were included. The use of TR-FIA assay buffer increased the P/N ratio of the Biotin-EIAs at least twofold compared with the standard EIA assay buffer, which was PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20. DTPA was the most essential reagent in the assay buffer which improved the Biotin-EIA performance. With semipurified virus, TR-FIA was always more sensitive than Biotin-EIA, but with clinical specimens no difference was observed. No quantitative tests were done with highly purified virus preparations, so the sensitivities could not be expressed as ng/ml values.

Next, we selected 257 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens to test simultaneously with Biotin-EIA and TR-FIA. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The overall agreement was 95.7%: 192 specimens (74.7%) were positive and 54 (21%) were negative in both assays. From 11 specimens with discrepant results, 9 were positive in Biotin-EIA but negative in TR-FIA, and 2 were positive in TR-FIA but negative in EIA. The range of OD values and cps are shown in Table 3 .

The sensitivity of Biotin-EIA and TR-FIA was further tested by titrating three specimens positive for each virus. All specimens tested were positive in each assay at least up to a 1:500 dilution (data not shown).

The specificity of Biotin-EIA was confirmed by selecting 10 NPA specimens positive in Biotin-EIA and testing them against the six other respiratory viruses by Biotin-EIA. None were positive in these cross-matched tests.

Biotin-EIA was also tested by one-hour incubation format. The preliminary results obtained showed a slight decrease in the absolute optical density values, but the P/N ratios were similar to those obtained with the overnight format. 

The results of the present study indicate that the all-monoclonal biotin-avidin enzyme immunoassays can be optimized to the same sensitivity as the all-monoclonal TR-FIAs for the detection of respiratory virus antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens of patients with acute respiratory disease. The important details in these optimization experiments included simultaneous incubation of the specimen with biotinylated monoclonal detector antibody in microtiter wells coated with catching antibody. Apparently, the liquid phase antigen-antibody reaction and immediate binding of the complexes on the solid phase catching antibody is more efficient than step-wise reaction (first, the antigen on catching antibody on solid phase and then, after washing, the binding of the biotinylated detector antibody on the antigen). Additional improvements of the test were obtained by overnight incubation of detector antibody with specimen, and by using the TR-FIA diluent containing 20 ~tM N'-diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid. The effect of this chelating agent on an EIA test is not clear, but it should be evaluated in other antigen/antibody EIA systems.

Another interesting finding was the difference in avidity of the parainfluenza 1 and 2 monoclonal antibodies after biotinylation and Eu-chelate labeling. Biotinylated antibodies resulted in low sensitivity, even though the coupling reaction is similar in both labeling procedures. Both involve primary amino groups, and the molecular weights of biotin and Eu-chelate are similar: 400 and 450, respectively. To overcome this problem, we screened other MAbs available against parainfluenza 1 and 2 viruses and found different clones that were more optimal. A change in the capture antibody was also necessary to optimize these two assays. These clones were not tested in TR-FIA, so information about how efficient they are after Eu-labelling is not available.

The Biotin-EIA tests we developed longer incubation times and an additional pipetting step (stopping solution) compared with TR-FIA. However, even with these inconveniences, many laboratories having no TR-FIA expertise or equipment may find these Biotin-EIA formats to be superior to other tests for detecting respiratory viruses in clinical specimens. Overnight incubation was not extensively compared with the customary 1 h incubation at 37 C' C with clinical specimens, but did improve the sensitivity of the tests. With semipurified control antigens, the overnight incubation was significantly better. The use of the overnight format and the higher concentration of the biotinylated monoclonals in biotin-EIA could explain the 9 'false negative' results we had in TR-FIA. As regards the 54 negative specimens that we found using both methods, we suppose they could be due to the fact that, especially in the cases of influenza B and parainfluenza specimens, all the aspirates were stored for more than 2 years at -2OC and were frozen and thawed many times before we tested them, so the viral proteins, particularly the nucleoproteins, may have been denaturated.

What is the advantage of Biotin-EIA or TR-FIA compared with the immunofluorescence technique (Gardner and McQuillin, 1980; Grandien et al., 1985) in rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections? The answer depends on the location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested daily, the availability of reagents, and the previous expertise of the laboratory. Solid phase immunoassays have two definite advantages. One is the possibility for bulk testing, because a technician can test up to 40 specimens per day for seven respiratory viruses with TR-FIA and it takes only minutes for a virologist to read the test. Another advantage is the stability of the specimens for Biotin-EIA or TR-FIA, since no intact cells are required in the specimens and the viral proteins in the virion or in soluble form are relatively stable, at least if they are not frozen and thawed several times; thus, if necessary, the specimens can be sent to the laboratory without cooling, even by mail. However, these advantages do not apply to smaller hospital laboratories where a limited number of specimens is tested daily and transportation is not a factor.

The availability of immunoreagents is one of the greatest problems for laboratories interested in Biotin-EIA or TR-FIA for the detection of respiratory virus antigens. Hopefully, biotinylated reagents or EIA/TR-FIA kits will become commercially available for the major respiratory viruses in the near future.

Broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus from vaccinated healthy donors,"Human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) prepared from patients with viral infections could provide information on human epitopes important for the development of vaccines as well as potential therapeutic applications. Through the fusion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a total of five influenzavaccinated volunteers, with newly developed murine-human chimera fusion partner cells, named SPY-MEG, we obtained 10 hybridoma clones stably producing anti-influenza virus antibodies: one for influenza A H1N1, four for influenza A H3N2 and five for influenza B. Surprisingly, most of the HuMAbs showed broad reactivity within subtype and four (two for H3N2 and two for B) showed broad neutralizing ability. Importantly, epitope mapping revealed that the two broad neutralizing antibodies to H3N2 derived from different donors recognized the same epitope located underneath the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin globular region that is highly conserved among H3N2 strains.","The technology of monoclonal antibody (MAbs) preparation is important to provide material for the characterization of unique epitopes and conformational structures as well as the development of rapid diagnostic kits. Further, acute infections could be more effectively prevented with a passive immune strategy, as evidenced by the successful treatment of healthcare workers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus by transfusion with convalescent phase plasma obtained from SARS patients [1] and successful protection against viral infection in a mouse model of SARS-coronavirus infection with human MAbs (HuMAbs) obtained from a patient's memory cell repertoire [2] . Also, studies of Spanish flu that evaluated the effects of transfusion with influenza-convalescent blood products may offer insights regarding potential treatments for H5N1 infection [3] . Furthermore, it has been reported that an avian flu patient recovered following treatment with convalescent plasma from a donor [4] . Recently, there have been several trials using MAbs with neutralizing activity for the prevention of acute severe symptoms of influenza virus infection including H5N1 [5] [6] [7] [8] . Further, protective properties of MAbs directed at the stem region of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus H1N1 [9] and H5N1 [6] [7] [8] were demonstrated in mice. Based on these data, preparation of HuMAbs against viruses causing severe acute diseases that have potential therapeutic applications becomes of great importance.

Several factors affect the development of HuMAbs: the source of immune cells, such as human-derived memory B or plasma cells or murine cells; and the procedure to immortalize the immune cells, such as fusion with an appropriate partner cell line, EB virus-based transformation, molecular cloning of the immunoglobulin gene using phage display, and humanization of murine MAbs. Recently, a rapid cloning method for high-affinity HuMAbs against influenza virus was established using single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the immunoglobulin variable regions. For that, single-sorted plasma cells secreting influenza-specific IgG + derived from influenza-vaccinated healthy volunteers were used [10] . In this study, we employed a novel approach for the development of HuMAbs against influenza viruses using a newly prepared cell line, named SPYMEG, that was generated by fusion of SP2 myeloma cells of murine origin and MEG-01 human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells [11] HuMAbs that showed broad neutralizing activity against human influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses.

Volunteers. A total of five healthy volunteers who received influenza vaccination were selected (A, 28 year-old male; B, 35 year-old female; C, 28 year-old male; D, 57 year-old male; and E, 29 yearold female). Ten milliliters of blood were obtained from individual volunteer and the PBMCs were prepared by centrifugation through Ficoll Pack Plus (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) for 40 min at 520g.

Vaccine Cell fusion. The PBMCs were fused with SPYMEG cells at a ratio of 10:1 with polyethylene glycol #1500. Fused cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% FCS in 96-well microplates for 10-14 days in the presence of HAT. The first screening of the culture medium for antibodies specific to influenza viruses was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described below. Specific antibodypositive wells were next subjected to cell cloning by limiting dilution. The second screening was also performed by ELISA.

ELISA. The 96-well microplates coated with viral antigens were reacted with the culture medium of fused cells for 30 min at room temperature, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Aichi, Japan).

Immunofluorescence assay. Monolayers of MDCK cells in 8-well chamber slides were mock-infected or infected with influenza A and B viruses. After 8 h of incubation, the infected cells were fixed with ethanol then reacted with the culture medium of individual hybridoma cell clones. As control antibodies, we used several murine MAbs, i.e., C43 to nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A H3N2 virus [12] , C179 to HA of H1N1 [12] , F49 to HA of H3N2 (Okuno, unpublished) , 9F3 to NP of influenza B virus [13] , and 9E10 to HA of influenza B virus [14] . The cells were then reacted with fluores-cein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-human or antimouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK).

Western blotting. Purified HA vaccine antigens in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer were subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes then incubated with the culture medium of individual hybridoma clones. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), the peroxidase reaction on the membrane was visualized using the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).

Peroxidase and anti-peroxidase (PAP) staining. PAP staining was carried out as described previously [15] . Briefly, MDCK cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with influenza virus and cultured for 6 h in FCS-free DMEM. The infected cells were fixed with ethanol and reacted with the culture medium of individual hybridoma cell clones. As controls, we used several murine MAbs as mentioned above. The cells were further incubated with rabbit anti-human or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel), then with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel), and finally with PAP complex (Cappel).

Hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) test. The HI test was carried out as described previously [12] . The culture medium of individual hybridoma clones was treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE). The results were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the culture medium to show inhibition.

Virus neutralization (VN) test. The VN test was carried out as described previously [15] . Briefly, the culture media of individual hybridoma clones that were treated with RDE were diluted 1:8 with serum-free medium. The diluted culture medium of individual hybridoma clones (50 lL) was mixed with 100 FFU of influenza virus (50 lL), then applied to MDCK cells in a 96-well microplate.

After culturing for 6 h, the cells were fixed with ethanol and stained with PAP as above. The data were expressed as percentage of infectivity.

Sequence analysis of HuMAb variable regions. Total RNA was extracted from 1 Â 10 5 hybridoma cells and reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42°C for 90 min, using Human IgGH RT-primer (5 0 -TGGAGGGCACGGTCACCACGC-3 0 ) and IgGL RT-Primer (5 0 -T TGTGACGGGCGAGCTCAGGC-3 0 ) for kappa chain, and also using dT Primer for lambda chain. Next, we performed 5 0 RACE PCR with the SMART TM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA), using Human IgGH RACE-primer (5 0 -AAGGTG TGCACGCCGCTGGTC-3 0 ), Human IgGL(kappa) RACE-primer (5 0 -GT GCTGCTGAGGCTGTAGGTG-3 0 ) or Human IgGL(lambda) RACE-primer (5 0 -CCAYTGTCTTCTCCACRGTRCTCYC-3 0 and 5 0 -TCAGAGGAG-GRYGGGAACAGAGTG-3 0 ) as the reverse primer and Universal primer mix as the forward primer, and then cloned the PCR products into the cloning plasmid pMD20-T (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). Sequence analysis was performed with an ABI3730 Sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA), using the M13 primer RV or M13 primer M4 and the BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer).

Epitope mapping. A total of 158 sets of 15-residue peptides (overlapping by 13 amino acids) spanning amino acid (aa) residues 1-329 of the HA1 region of A/Hiroshima/52/05 (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were subjected to binding activity assay using peptide microarrays [16, 17] with the HuMAbs obtained.

Ethics. All human materials were collected using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University.

Ten milliliters of blood from five volunteers was obtained at various time points after influenza vaccination for fusion with SPY-MEG cells. In 14 experiments, a total of 122 wells were positive for influenza virus-specific HuMAbs in the first screening. However, during subsequent cell cloning and expansion to a large-scale culture, most of the hybridoma cell clones lost the ability to produce HuMAbs. Eventually, 10 hybridoma clones were found to stably produce specific HuMAbs for at least 3 months ( Table 1 ). The efficacy to detect the specific antibody-producing wells was higher with the PBMCs derived from vaccines at 2-3 weeks postvaccination.

We next determined the influenza virus type recognized by individual HuMAbs. First, an immunofluorescence analysis was carried out and the results were as follows: E-1 recognized H1N1; A-2, B-1, B-2 and D-1 recognized H3N2; and A-1, B-3, C-1, D-2 and E-2 recognized B viruses. Representative results of B-1 and D-1 to influenza A virus (H3N2) and B-3 and E-2 to influenza B virus are shown in Fig. 1A . As control antibodies, we used several anti-influenza HA and NP murine MAbs. The staining pattern of infected MDCK cells obtained with our HuMAbs was very similar to that obtained with the anti-HA, but not anti-NP murine MAbs. PAP staining and ELISA of these HuMAbs gave the same results (Table  1) . Five MAbs (E-1 to H1N1; B-1 and D-1 to H3N2; and A-1 and C-1 to B) showed distinct bands of HA protein on Western blotting, but the other MAbs showed little or no reactivity with any viral proteins including HA by this method, indicating their recognition of conformational epitope(s) (Fig. 1B) . As a control antibody, we used 2000-fold dilution of donor B-derived plasma.

Anti-H3N2 and anti-B HuMAbs obtained in this study were next examined for cross-reactivity with several vaccine strains of influenza virus subtypes by PAP staining and VN testing. All the HuM-Abs, except for D-2 weakly reacting with Sh/02, showed broad reactivity with strains within the same subtype on PAP staining (Table 2 ). Next, HuMAbs were examined for broad neutralizing activity against several H3N2 and B virus strains (Fig. 1C) . The results of the VN test were similar to those of PAP straining. B-1 and D-1 showed strong neutralizing activity against H3N2 vaccine strains that were isolated during 1968-2005 and during 1989-2005, respectively. B-3 and E-2 showed mild neutralizing activity against B Victoria-group and Yamagata-group strains that were isolated during 1987-2004. There was no cross-reaction in these HuMAbs among H1N1 (data not shown), H3N2 and/or B viruses (Table 2 ). Interestingly, little or no HI activity was detected in the supernatant of hybridoma cell clones (Table 1) , but a little HI activity was detected with the concentrated purified B-1 and D-1 (data not shown).

Based on the results of the Western blotting analysis, HuMAbs B-1 and D-1 seemed to recognize sequential epitopes of HA. Using a series of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the HA1 region, we tried to identify the neutralizing epitopes. Interestingly, both MAbs showed the same responses to the synthesized peptides, i.e., significant responses to 2 regions by 4 (aa 167-181, 169-183, 171-185 and 173-187) and 2 (aa 225-239 and 227-241) peptides, spanning the overlapping regions aa 173-181 and 227-239, respectively (Fig. 2A) . These regions are highly conserved, except for aa 173 and 227. These amino acids were located underneath the receptor-binding site of the HA globular region (Fig. 2B) .

Sequence analysis of the V H and V L region of HuMAbs B-1 and D-1 was performed. Further, amino acid sequences of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were deduced and compared (Fig. 2C) . Although B-1 and D-1 recognized the same region in HA1, these HuMAbs had different amino acid residues in the CDRs.

Two serotypes of influenza virus, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B viruses are circulating predominantly with the H3N2 serotype and B viruses highly prevailed during the last 2 years in Japan [18, 19] . In fact, HuMAbs obtained from five Japanese volunteers given the 2007 vaccine mostly recognized H3N2 and B viruses. Those HuMAbs are broadly reactive with the past strains of H3N2 and B viruses, as revealed by PAP staining as well as the VN assay.

Nine of 10 HuMAbs obtained in this study showed cross-reactivity with a wide-range of past strains of influenza A H3N2 or B virus. In addition, cross-reactivity was also observed for most of them in the VN test. This result may suggest that since humans have history of exposure to influenza virus antigens by natural infection as well as influenza vaccination, the immune cells recognizing global epitopes in the influenza virus seem to quickly respond by vaccination and therefore the use of PBMCs few weeks post-vaccination for cell fusion may be advantageous for the preparation of a wide-range subtype-reactive MAbs like B-1 and D-1. Both HuMAbs recognized two separate regions (aa 173-181 and aa 227-239), located close to each other in the three dimensional structure of HA1, a novel human epitope. This result suggested that B-1 and D-1 recognized a conformational epitope. There have been several studies of HA epitopes of influenza A H3N2, using murine MAbs [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , or rabbit [26, 27] and human [28] polyclonal antisera. Moreover, a mouse MAb recognizing a conformational epitope containing aa 186, 220, 229 and 230 was reported [23] . However, this epitope overlapped only at aa 229 and 230 with the epitope of B-1 and D-1. It is noteworthy to mention that the above two HuMAbs recognizing the same epitope with a highly conserved sequence were independently prepared from two volunteers, as confirmed from the different sequences of their CDRs.

In conclusion, the development of HuMAbs using PBMCs from volunteers who have been naturally exposed to influenza viruses or vaccinated, as well as from patients with influenza infection at a convalescent phase, would provide potential therapeutic application(s).

Genetic Vaccines and Therapy Genetic immunization with Hantavirus vaccine combining expression of G2 glycoprotein and fused interleukin-2,"In this research, we developed a novel chimeric HTNV-IL-2-G2 DNA vaccine plasmid by genetically linking IL-2 gene to the G2 segment DNA and tested whether it could be a candidate vaccine. Chimeric gene was first expressed in eukaryotic expression system pcDNA3.1 (+). The HTNV-IL-2-G2 expressed a 72 kDa fusion protein in COS-7 cells. Meanwhile, the fusion protein kept the activity of its parental proteins. Furthermore, BALB/c mice were vaccinated by the chimeric gene. ELISA, cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. Lymphocyte proliferation assay was used to detect the cellular immune response.-The results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously evoke specific antibody against G2 glycoprotein and IL-2. And the immunized mice of every group elicited neutralizing antibodies with different titers. Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of chimeric gene to G2 and IL-2 were significantly higher than that of other groups. Our results suggest that IL-2-based HTNV G2 DNA can induce both humoral and cellular immune response specific for HTNV G2 and can be a candidate DNA vaccine for HTNV infection.","The Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a member of the genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae and a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [1, 2] . More than 100,000 cases of HFRS are reported annually, with a mortality rate between 2% and 10% [3] . However, no effective vaccine has been developed to prevent this disease.

HTNV is a spherical, enveloped virus with a genome consisting of three segments of single-stranded, negativesense RNA. The three segments are designated as large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments that encode RNAdependent RNA polymerase, respectively [4] ]. It is indicated that the glycoprotein (GP), which was encoded by M segment, could elicit organism to produce neutralizing antibody and could protect infected animal and human body from Hantavirus lethal infection [5] . Moreover, the neutralization sites of GP mainly exist in G2 [6] .

In the past few years, immunization with naked DNA has become an alternative approach for vaccination against infectious diseases. The expression vectors used for DNA vaccines usually contain the gene(s) for an antigenic portion of a virus or bacteria, under the transcriptional control of a mammalian promoter. Direct injection of the DNA into skeletal muscles results in the synthesis of proteins that subsequently stimulate the host immune system leading to both humoral and cellular immune responses specific to the expressed protein [7, 8] . Recently, several published reports describe the application of DNA vaccines to examine the protective potential of several HTNV proteins [9] [10] [11] . We have previously reported that the G2 glycoprotein gene could be expressed in cells transiently and retain specific antigenicity to the Chinese Hantavirus strain H8205 (from the Epidemic Disease Research Institute, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China), indicating that the HTNV-G2 recombinant plasmid could be used to develope DNA vaccine against Hantavirus [12] .

Use of cytokines as adjutants can enhance various immune responses when administered during the development of an immune response to a particular antigen. IL-2 is one of the extensively studied cytokine adjuvants [13] [14] [15] . When administered in multiple injections, IL-2 increased the development of antigen-specific immune response and protective immunity against challenge with the infectious agents [16] . The adjuvant efficacy was further enhanced by physically linking IL-2 to an antigen so that the cytokine effect is retained in the local environment where the immune response is initiated. Previous studies have shown that co-expression of IL-2 has also been shown to enhance the immune response to the HSV1 glycoprotein D antigen in DNA vaccines [17] . These investigations have made IL-2 an attractive adjuvant for vaccine development.

In this study, we developed a HTNV-G2 and IL-2 fusion transgene that directly elicited specific anti-HTNV humoral and cellular immune response. These results suggest that HTNV-IL-2-G2 DNA may be used as a candidate vaccine. 

To construct the eukaryotic expression plasmid DNA vector for IL-2 DNA, the full-length IL-2 DNA was amplified from plasmid PUC19-IL-2 (Department of molecular biology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) encoding human IL-2 gene by PCR using IL-2 primers (forward, 5'-GGCATCGCAAGCTTATGGCACCTACTTCAA-3'reverse, 5'-GCTCTCCGGTACCCTGCAGTGTTGAGATGA -3'), which also introduced an Hind III and KpnIrestriction sites, respectively (underlined) to the amplicons. The PCR-amplified IL-2 DNA fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases Hind III and KpnI and annealed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase (TaKaRa, Japan) to Hind III and KpnI-digested pcDNA3.1 (+) expression vector (Invitrogen™ Life Technologies) DNA, downstream of the CMV promoter, hereafter referred to as pcDNA3.1/IL-2.

To construct the DNA vector containing the fused form of HTNV IL-2-G2, HTNV G2 DNA was amplified from plasmid pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2 (Department of Pathogenic Biology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) encoding G2 gene by PCR using primers(forward, 5'-GGGGTAC-CTACGGGCTGCAAGTGCTTCTGAAAC -3'reverse, 5'-CCGCTCGAGTAGGACTATGCCTTCTTGTGC -3') designed to introduce KpnI and XhIrestriction sites at 5'and 3'ends of the amplicons, respectively(underlined), and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/IL-2 at the KpnI restriction site's 3'-flank to the IL-2 gene, resulting in pcDNA3.1/ HTNV-IL-2-G2. Following ligation, the reconstruct plasmids were introduced into transformation-competent E. coli DH5α (TaKaRa, Japan) and cultured overnight. Plasmid DNA was purified by using Qiagen Maxiprep DNA purification kits(Qiagen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The presence of the inserted DNA fragment was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. All the constructs were further verified by DNA-sequencing (Applied Biosystems, USA). The DNA was finally resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.

COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Inv-itrogen™ Life Technologies) was used in transfection. The transfection was performed according to the protocol of Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/ HTNV IL-2-G2 and the control group pcDNA3.1(+). After 48-72 h, the expressed proteins were detected.

For immunofluorescence, the transfected COS-7 cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT, followed by extensive washing with PBS. After blocking in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h, the cells were incubated with anti-G2 Mab (Epidemic disease Research Institute, Academy of military medical sciences, China) or polyclonal mouse anti-IL2 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:50 dilution) for 1 h at RT, bridged by avidin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:300 dilution) for 1 h at RT, subsequently detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:32 dilution) and rodaminlabeled biotin (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at RT. After thoroughly washing, the coverslips were mounted and observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope

To detect protein expression by western blot, the transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer. The cell lysates were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) against IL-2 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:50 dilution) or against HTNV G2 (at 1:400 dilution), detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (at 1:600 dilution, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The emitted light was captured on X-ray film.

The cells cultured at 37°C in a shaking incubator overnight. When the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.4-0.6, a final concentration of 0.3 mM of IPTG was added to the culture to induce the protein expression, and the cells were grown for another 5 h. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation in 50 ml volumes at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, disrupted by sonication in a lysis buffer containing nonionic detergent and lysozyme. IL-2-G2 proteins were purified using nickel nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The identity of the purified protein was verified by western blot with anti-IL-2 MAb or anti-G2 MAb.

DNA vaccination of C57BL/6 mice C57BL/6 mice were immunized with DNA constructs, using a modification of a previously described method [18] . Briefly, mice, three to four per group, five groups in total, were immunized with 100 μg of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2, pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmids (in 50 μl of PBS) and PBS respectively, per mouse in both anterior tibial muscles that had been pretreated with 0.25% bupivacaine 2 days before vaccination. The second immunizations were given at intervals of approximately 2 weeks using the same amount of DNA, followed by boost once with 200 pM per mouse of their homologous recombinant proteins 2 weeks after the second DNA immunization.

Sera were collected from a retroorbital plexus puncture 10 days after last protein boost or an animal's tail vein puncture of immunized mice at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 (where 0 represents the first day of immunization). The G2 and IL-2-specific antibodies in the sera were determined by an indirect ELISA method. The purified G2 of HTNV and IL-2 protein(Epidemic disease Research Institute, Academy of military medical sciences, China) were used as coating antigen. Then the sera were serially diluted and reacted with G2 and IL-2 antigen. HRP-SPA conjugate was used as secondary antibody. The titers were defined as the reciprocal of the positive highest serum dilution.

This test was performed on Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96well tissue culture plates with HTNV strains H8205. The E6 clone of Vero cells was grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The sera titer were twofold serially diluted from 1:15 in DMEM medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and filtrated through 0.22 μm filter. Then it were incubated with viruses at 37°C for 90 min. Virus-sera mixtures were applied to cell monolayers and incubated at 37°C for 8-10 days in 5% CO2 incubator. Thereafter, the cells were lysed with three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles. HTNV antigen in the lysate was detected by sandwich ELISA. The anti-G2 Mab were used as coating antibody and HRP-SPA conjugate were used as secondary antibody.

Eight weeks after the final booster dose, mice were sacrificed. Spleens were removed from immunized mice and purified by lymphocytes separation medium. Then the mice splenocytes suspension were applied in 96-well tissue culture plates and co-incubated for 68 h with HTNV G2 and IL-2 antigen, which was responsible for induction of cellular response to HTNV, and blank control at 37°C in 5% CO 2 incubator. After applied MTT [(4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium-bromide,5 mg/ ml] 20 μL/well for 4 h, 150 μL/well DMSO was used to dissolve the blue formazun precipitate. The extinction coefficient was measured at 490 nm. The proliferation index was calculated as follows: proliferation index = A490 nm value stimulated with antigen/A490 nm value stimulated with blank control.

Differences between assays are analyzed using one-tailed or two-tailed pair t-test as appropriate (GraphPad Prism). Probability values of Ϲ 0.05 are considered to represent significant differences.

The eukaryotic expression plasmids, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 were constructed as described in Fig. 1A . By restriction analysis, a 0.8, 1.9 or 2.7 kb fragment was identified, respectively, in HTNV IL-2-G2 recombinant plasmid (Fig.  1B) , which corresponded, respectively, to IL-2, HTNV G2 or fused HTNV IL-2-G2 DNA. The nucleotide sequences introduced into vectors were further confirmed by automatic sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems, USA), and matched human IL-2 (accession number NM_000586) sequences deposited in the GenBank, perfectly (data not shown).

We analysed the expressions of expected proteins by western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A , the immunoblots showed a large protein band of about 72 kDa present in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL2-G2 that reacted with both anti-IL2 and anti-G2 antibodies. This corresponds to the expressed 72 kDa G2-IL2 fusion protein.

Immunofluorent staining revealed cytoplasmic expression of IL-2-G2 in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 (Fig. 2B) . These results indicated that the vaccine plasmidDNAs could express efficiently in eukaryotic cells.

To investigate whether the recombinant DNA vectors could elicit HTNV G2-specific humoral response, ELISA and cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. Meanwhile, the stimulation index of splenocytes to G2 was measured by MTT assay.

ELISA results showed that the average titer of the specific antibody against HTNV G2 in the mice immunized with G2-IL2 was 1:70. Whereas, the specific antibody of the average titer of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group against IL-2 was 1:100. The specific antibody of the average titer of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2 group against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were negative and 1:70. The results of pcDNA3.1/ HTNV-G2 group against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were 1:55 and 1:40. The results of pcDNA3.1 and PBS groups against HTNV G2 and IL-2 were all negative (Fig. 3A) .

Cell microculture neutralization test results showed that part of the immunized mice of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group could elicit neutralizing antibodies with different titers. But the neutralizing antibody titers were low (Table  1) .

Lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group to IL-2 and G2 were all significantly higher than that of other groups (Fig. 3B ).

It is well known that the G1 and G2 of HTNV may both play important roles in evoking neutralizing antibody for protecting against HTNV infection and in cell-mediated protective immune response. Cytokines as indicators and regulators of the immune network play important roles in the immune and inflammatory responses. Previous studies showed the potential of the IL-2 gene as a molecular adjuvant, which appear promising for protective immunity against virus infection [19, 20] . Meanwhile, augmentation of DNA vaccine-elicited immune responses using plasmid IL-2 has been reported in several murine disease models [21, 22] .

In the present study, we developed a novel chimeric HTNV IL2-G2 DNA vaccine by genetically linking IL2 gene to the full-length G2 segment DNA. Then we investigated the expression of the recombinant vectors in mammalian cells. RT-PCR and western blot analysis results proved by mRNA and protein levels that the recombinant vector was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells-. The immunofluorescence results showed that pcDNA3.1/ HTNV-IL-2-G2 DNA could express protein in mammal cells.

Previous studies demonstrated that DNA vaccine plasmids expressing HTNV glycoproteins could elicit the production of G2 protein in mice, hamsters and nonhuman primates. In vaccinated hamsters, for example, the presence of G2 antigen correlated with protection against HTNV infection [23] . On the basis of this work, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with the recombinant eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2-IL2. To avoid the potential side effects associated with systemic administration of recombinant cytokines, such as the generation of antibodies to IL2 and the neutralization of endogenous IL2, a sustained but low level of cytokines delivered to tissues of immune interactions may reduce the toxicity of these pleiotropic compounds, while improving their therapeutic and practical value in providing vaccine adjuvant effects. Direct injection into mouse skeletal muscle of expression vector encoding cytokines provides such a means. ELISA and cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. The stimulation indexes of splenocytes to IL2 and G2 were measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay.-ELISA results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously elicit specific antibody against IL-2 and G2.

Mice neutralizing antibodies protect mice and humans from viral infection, it is very important to use a chimeric vaccine such as the G2-IL2 that elicits a strong immune response in vivo. Cell microculture test results showed that the mice in the pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2-IL2 vaccination group produced different neutralizing antibody titers; but they were all consistently low. This result may be caused by variations in the expression level of genetic vaccines that elicit low levels of antibody production It has been demonstrated that both humoral and cellular immune response were important in host defense against HTNV [24] . Adoptive transfer of immune T cells protected suckling mice from death following infection with HTNV [25] . Furthermore, it was also found that T cells expressing CD4-CD8 + markers on their surface were especially important for elimination of infectious viruses in vivo [25] . Others reported that T-cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in resistance of mice to HTNV infection. Recently, CTL epitopes in HTNV have been identified [26] . MTT results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of chimeric gene group to G2 and IL-2 were significantly higher than that of control. The chimeric genes could also evoke cellular immune response in mice.

In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine that fuses IL2 with HTNV G2 can directly elicit a specific anti-HTNV humoral and cellular immune response in BALB/c mice. It was suggested that IL-2 and HTNV G2-based HTNV DNA strategy appears to be an attractive approach for the rational design and development of new and more efficacious DNA vaccines for HTNV-associated diseases.

Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation as a marker for assessing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in human plasma and influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy,"This study describes an antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation assay, as a biomarker to assess antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response in influenza plasma and for antibody therapies against influenza infection. The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.","Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity/mortality in human populations across the globe (Lavanchy, 1999) . Influenza viruses are estimated to cause 3-5 million severe clinical infections yearly resulting in 250,000-500,000 fatalities (Stohr, 2002) . Influenza A viruses, including H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes, are involved in seasonal epidemics with pandemic potential (Stohr, 2002) . Immune-mediated protection against influenza viruses is thought to be largely dependent on neutralizing antibody (NAbs) specific against the membrane-distal portion of the viral envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) preventing binding of virus to target cell sialic acids (Matlin et al., 1981) .

Assessment of antibody (Ab) responses to specific influenza subtypes is an important diagnostic, epidemiological, and immunological tool (Cauchemez et al., 2012) . Demonstration of serotype-and subserotype-(""subtype-"") specific Ab responses in individuals following suspected infection or vaccination may be accomplished by a variety of methods. For influenza, the most widely used assay to assess antibody (IgG and otherwise) levels is the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, which provides a relative measure of the quantity of anti-HA Abs present in patient sera/plasma (Hobson et al., 1972; Katz et al., 2011) . Additional assays that are employed include the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) and microneutralization (MN) assays that are used to detect neuraminidase-specific antibodies and the ability of plasma antibodies to neutralize infectivity of influenza virus respectively. The serological methods described above do not assess the entire breadth of the antibody mediated responses to influenza viruses. Additional serological and cellular effector functions include: (i) complement activation (Terajima et al., 2011) ; (ii) phagocytosis (El Bakkouri et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2001; Ana-Sosa-Batiz et al., 2016) ; and (iii) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Greenberg et al., 1979; Jegaskanda et al., 2013a Jegaskanda et al., , 2016 Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Co et al., 2014; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Srivastava et al., 2013; Jegaskanda et al., 2017 Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c .

Anti-influenza NAbs can directly or in combination with complement block or deactivate infectious viral particles prior to entry into host cells. However, if viral particles escape from NAbs and establish infection inside target cells NAbs may no longer be optimally effective, and immune effector cells are then required to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells. NK cells are an immune effector cell type that provides a first line of defense against infections and cell malignancies. NK cells can bind to cell surface antigen-Ab immune complexes via the Fc portion of the antibody. FcγRIII is a receptor found on a number of different effector cells, importantly NK cells, and is involved in effector cell recognition of virally infected cells and induction of ADCC (Wren et al., 2013) . CD107a (LAMP1) expression on NK cells has been used as a surrogate marker for the identification of natural killer cell activity (Alter et al., 2004) .

ADCC against influenza has been demonstrated in a number of studies (Greenberg et al., 1979; Jegaskanda et al., 2013a Jegaskanda et al., , 2016 Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a Jegaskanda et al., , b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Co et al., 2014; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Srivastava et al., 2013; Jegaskanda et al., 2017; Jegaskanda et al., 2013c; DiLillo et al., 2014; Cox et al., 2016) . Assays based on radioactive chromium-labeling of target cells have been used to demonstrate the presence of antibodies capable of ADCC activity (Greenberg et al., 1979) , and to demonstrate the presence of ADCC antibodies in clinical influenza serum samples (Co et al., 2014) . Assays based on assessing CD107a expression of NK cells following incubation on serum-treated plates coated with influenza proteins have been conducted (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a (Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a (Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Jegaskanda et al., 2017 Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c . These studies have largely used a flow-based ADCC NK cell activation assay using methods that are less physiologically relevant due to the removal of target cell and effector cell interaction. One influenza ADCC study utilized a flow-based method for assessing target cell lysis via membrane-labeling dyes following effector cell interaction (Srivastava et al., 2013) . Influenza-infection of A549, an immortalized human epithelial cell line, has also been utilized for measuring ADCC Ab activity using CD107a expression of NK cells co-incubated with target cells (Jegaskanda et al., 2017 (Jegaskanda et al., , 2013c DiLillo et al., 2014) . Additionally, a bioassay to measure FcγRIIIa activation by ADCC-Abs has also been conducted using influenza HA-transfected A549 cells following incubation with human plasma samples and Jurkat (effector) cells (Cox et al., 2016) . Additional non-radioactive ADCC assays are becoming commercially available (Surowy et al., 2012) .

ADCC-mediated clearance of virally infectected cells and ADCC protection following vaccination or natural infection are potentially important immune mechanisms against influenza infection. Immunoglobulin-based therapuetic products such as human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should also be capable of stimulating an ADCC immune response to be maximally effective therapeutics. Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of immunized bovine IgG to induce NK cell activation and mediate ADCC immunity to HIV infection (Kramski et al., 2012) . Recently SAB Biotherapeutics has developed a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine system that replaces knocked out bovine immunoglobulin genes with a human artificial choromosome containing full germline sequences of human immunoglobulin (Kuroiwa et al., 2009; Matsushita et al., 2014 Matsushita et al., , 2015 Sano et al., 2013) . These Tc bovine are capable of producing full human antibodies, and have been used to produce polyclonal human IgG against hantavirus (Hooper et al., 2014) , Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) , and Ebola Zaire virus (Dye et al., 2016) . Tc bovine hyperimmunized against pandemic strains of influenza also have the potential to produce a commercially viable IVIG product capable of neutralizing antibody and ADCC-antibody functions. As such, development of a standardized NK cell assay for detecting ADCC activity against influenza viruses could aid in the assessment of: (i) population immunity; (ii) vaccine and therapuetic IVIG treatment efficacy; and (iii) possibly a clinical assay to indicate if an infected individual will or will not progress to severe illness.

To examine ADCC-Abs from a plasma panel collection, including Tc bovine IVIG, we utilized a high-throughput, non-radioactive, assay assessing influenza infection of Raji target cells and plasma Ab ability to activate NK effector cells as demonstrated by degranulation (CD107a surrogate expression). In this study we describe a reproducible and relevant method for assessing NK cell degranulation titer of plasma/ sera samples. Using this assay we determined that Tc bovine IVIG had a high titer of NK cell degranulation antibodies, and thus represents a system that could be used as a countermeasure to rapidly produce fully human antibodies capable of eliciting ADCC responses against pandemic influenza.

Raji cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CCL-86; Manassas, VA) were grown in complete RPMI media (Gibco; Langley, OK) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Quality Biological; Gaithersburg, MD) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Corning; Corning, NY). Prior to infection with influenza, cells were washed with 1 x PBS, then resuspended in RPMI media with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA), 1% P/S, and Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Accurate Chemical; Westbury, NY) at 2 μg TPCK/mL media.

Blood was collected from healthy donors under a protocol approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects: HRPP# NMRC.2012.0008. Effector cells for assessing NK cell degranulation were the non-adherent fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. Donor PBMCs were screened for NK cell degranulation capacity in our lab as previously published (Sun et al., 2017) . Utilizing data from that study, donor PBMCs with a degranulation capacity above 10% of background were utilized for all subsequent experiments described within this manuscript. The preparation of non-adherent PBMCs has been described previously (Sun et al., 2006) . Briefly, cryopreserved whole PBMCs were thawed, washed and brought to 2 × 10 6 cells/mL in culture medium, and were placed into a 6 well plate (Becton Dickinson MultiwellTM PrimariaTM 6 well; Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 3 mL/well. The plate was kept at 37°C for 1-2 h to allow monocytes to adhere to the plate. After adherence, non-adherent cells were gently collected from the plate into a 15-mL or a 50-mL tube. The non-adherent cells were then washed once and were brought to 1 × 10 6 cells/mL in culture medium. The cells were left in the 15-mL or 50-mL tube in a humidified 37°C 5% CO 2 incubator overnight. Before adding the effectors to the target cells with plasma, they were washed once, counted and adjusted to 1 × 10 6 /mL in culture medium.

H1N1 isolate A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) pandemic strain (Influenza Reagent Resource; Manassas, VA) virus was amplified in fertilized chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Eggs were incubated at 37°C with humidity and 0% CO 2 for 48 h, before transfer to 4°C for an additional 24 h. Allantoic fluid was then collected, spun down to remove debris, and titered with turkey red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories; Pipersville, PA) to determine hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 μL − an HAU/50 μL of 512 was determined.

Infection rate of Raji cells was determined by incubating 100,000 cells/well on a 96 well cell culture-treated plate (Corning Costar; Corning, NY) with dilutions of virus representing HAU of 102, 34, 10, and 3 per well for 24 h in RPMI media with 1% BSA and TPCK. Supplementation with TPCK was based on previous usage for influenza A infectivity studies (Jegaskanda et al., 2017; Su et al., 2009) . Cells were then washed two times with 1 x PBS and half were used for determination of cell surface expression of HA and half for intracellular expression of HA. For assessment of cell surface staining, 100 μL of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (MAB8256, Millipore, Billerica, MA) was applied at a dilution of 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature. For assessment of intracellular expression, cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA) for 20 min at room temperature and washed two times with PermWash prior to receiving antibody. All cells were then washed and stained with secondary FITC-conjugated goat α-mouse antibody (BD Pharmingen; San Jose, CA) at a dilution of 1:500 for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed then resuspended in 130 μL of 1 x PBS and assessed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS Canto II; San Jose, CA). Cells were assessed for mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of HA expression of all cells.

Human plasma samples were obtained through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under a protocol approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects: HRPP# NMRC.2010.0012. These plasma samples were screened for levels of antibodies against the A/California/ 07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) HA receptor using the World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HAI Assay previously described (Defang et al., 2012) .

2.6. The NK cell degranulation assay NK cell degranulation was assessed by the expression of CD107a on effector cells using a modified method described previously (Sun et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2009) . Briefly, on a 96 well U-bottom tissue culturetreated plate (Corning Costar), Raji cells were aliquoted at 100,000 cells/well and washed two times with PBS to remove residual FBS. Virus stock was diluted to a final concentration of 102 HAU per well with RPMI media with 1% BSA, P/S, and 2 μg/mL TPCK, and aliquoted at 100 μL/well. Plates were incubated 24 h at 37°C with humidity and 5% CO 2 . Plates were then washed two times with PBS, and dilutions of 1:200, 1:1000, 1:5000, and 1:25000 of plasma (100 μL/well) were applied and incubated on ice for 1.5 h. Plates were washed two times with PBS. Target cells treated with plasma were then divided into two parts, one for assessment of opsonization immediately after plasma treatment, and the other for determination of NK cell degranulation. For the opsonization plate, 100 μL/well of PE-conjugated α-human IgG (FC gamma-specific, 12-4998-82, EBioscience, San Diego, CA) diluted to 1:200 was added and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Plates were washed and then antibody opsonization of infected cells was assessed via flow cytometry on the FACS Canto II (Becton Dickinson). For setting up the NK cell degranulation assay, effector cells were collected, counted, and reconstituted in complete RPMI media to a concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells/mL. 100 μL/ well of effector cells were added to plasma-treated infected or uninfected target cells (Raji) at a ratio of 1:1 and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Media was removed and 20 μL of antibody cocktail containing 1:20 of α-CD56 (APC), α-CD3 (PerCp), α-CD16 (PE), and 1:10 of α-CD107a (FITC) (BD Biosciences) were added to each well and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 130 μL PBS. Cells were then assessed by flow cytometry. The CD3 − CD56 + NK cells were gated and the percentage of CD107a + cells within the NK cell population was analyzed. Effector cells not cultured with target cells were set as a negative control for background CD107a expression. Effector cells cultured with plasma-untreated target cells were set as baseline controls for Ab-independent NK cell activation.

To determine if A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) could infect Raji target cells in our assay, we infected 100,000 Raji cells with dilutions of H1N1pdm09 stock virus representing HAU of 102, 34, 10, and 3, and incubated cells for 24 h. We assessed cells for viral antigen expression with an α-HA MAb. Results indicated a rate of infection ( Fig. 1 ) congruent with previous determinations (Srivastava et al., 2013) . Cell populations were either stained right after incubation or fixed and permeabilized to compare overall HA expression vs. HA expression on cell surface (Fig. 1A) . Both indicated HA expression at 24 h following virus incubation with cells; however, this tapered off in the non-permeabilized population with increasing dilution of virus (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, the permeabilized population demonstrated a consistent rate of HA expression (∼59-66%) in all dilutions. We believe that the tapering off of HA expression seen for the non-permeabilized cells is likely due to increased non-internalized virions present on the cell surface for the lower dilutions of virus compared to higher dilutions. This results in a higher cell surface staining for HA for lower dilutions of virus compared to higher dilutions without affecting overall intracellular levels of HA. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity of HA expression was significantly higher in the permeabilized cells than the non-permeabilized cells at all dilutions of virus (Fig. 1C) .

We next elucidated opsonization of antigen expressed on the surface of infected target cells, and if this opsonization would activate NK effector cells. We assessed this across four dilutions of plasma and four dilutions of H1N1pdm09 virus infection. We selected two plasma samples that had high HAI titers against H1N1pdm09: Plasma1 (HAI 1280) and Plasma2 (HAI 640). The gating strategy for the assay is shown in Fig. 2A . NK cells (CD3 − CD56 + ) could be distinguished from T (CD3 + CD56 − ) and NKT (CD3 + CD56 + ) cells. We co-stained NK cells with CD16 to further visualize the concomitant loss of CD16 during NK cell activation (determined by enhanced CD107a expression).

To assess opsonization, target cells were incubated with human plasma obtained from volunteer donors. Plasma1 demonstrated low opsonization as assessed by MFI of antigen (Ag)/Ab binding over all plasma and viral dilutions (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, cells treated with Plasma2 demonstrated high opsonization (greater than 10000 MFI) remaining in the 1:1000 dilution of plasma and the 102 HAU dilution of virus (Fig. 2B) . For Plasma2 opsonization did decrease at the 1:5000 dilution of plasma. We then assessed if opsonization would result in NK cell activation. We incubated effector cells with targets for 2 h at 37°C, stained cells to select for the NK cell population, and determined NK cell activation by probing for expression of CD107a. Consistent with the opsonization data, there was significant CD107a expression in cells incubated with Plasma2. In contrast, for cells incubated with Plasma1 expression did not rise above baseline levels (Fig. 2C) . Taken together, these data suggest that NK cells are activated by interacting with opsonized antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells.

For the remaining experiments we standardized our infection of target cells at 102 HAU of H1N1pdm09 per 100,000 cells. We selected one plasma sample (HAI 640) and tested both opsonization (Fig. 3A) and NK cell degranulation (Fig. 3B ) reproducibility over three experiments for infected and uninfected target cells. The titer of Abs capable of stimulating NK cell activation was assessed by determining the fold increase of the NK cell response (Fig. 3C ) and the absolute value of the NK cell response (Fig. 3D ). Fold increase of NK cell response was determined by the fold increase of the CD107a NK cell response for infected cells compared to uninfected cells at each dilution. The absolute value of the CD107a NK cell response was determined as the percentage of NK cells expressing CD107a for infected cells minus the percentage for uninfected cells. The highest dilution of plasma that had both a two-fold increase of CD107a expression and an absolute value of CD107a over one was determined as the titer of NK cell degranulation. We selected 26 samples of human plasma. HAI titers against A/ California/07/2009 ranged from 5 to 1280, organized in low (HAI 5-50), middle (HAI 160-202), and high (HAI 320-1280) groups (Table 1) . Opsonization (presented as binding intensity) to uninfected cells was consistently low. For infected cells, we observed a MFI of 5000 or higher for opsonization of antigen in the 1:200 dilutions in all plasma except for Low10, High1, and High8 (Fig. 4A ). In 1:1000 or higher dilutions, opsonization tapered off dramatically in cells treated with the low titer and middle titer plasma. This phenomenon occurred to a lesser extent with the middle titer group. We observed higher opsonization in the 1:200 dilutions for most of the samples in the high titer group, and continued to see significant opsonization in the higher dilutions with the exception of High1 and High8 plasmas, which consistently showed diminished opsonization akin to the samples with low titer (Fig. 4A) .

In order to assess NK cell degranulation we incubated target cells in the same conditions as above, followed by incubation with effector cells for two hours. NK cell activity was determined by the percentage of NK cells expressing CD107a (Fig. 4B) . Two of the ten samples from the low titer group (Low6 and Low8) had up to 10% of NK cells expressing CD107a in the 1:200 dilutions. This was reduced to around baseline levels in all subsequent dilutions. Five of the eight middle titer plasma samples (Mid1, Mid4, Mid5, Mid6, Mid8) had at least 10% of NK cells expressing CD107a in the 1:200 dilutions. NK cell degranulation varied particularly widely among the high titer samples. Three of the eight high titer human plasma samples (High4, High5, High6) had at least 10% of NK cells expressing CD107a in the 1:200 dilutions, and we continued to observe high CD107a expression in the higher dilutions of these samples. High8 (HAI 1280) demonstrated both low opsonization and low NK cell degranulation.

For normalizing the data, NK cell activity was also presented as fold increase and absolute value for infected cells compared to uninfected cells. Heat map analysis (Fig. 5A ) of the CD107a expression fold increase for infected cells compared to uninfected cells demonstrated a trend towards more sustained (greater than two-fold) fold increase at Table 1 Human plasma sample set and transchromosomic (Tc) bovine IVIG. NK cell titer is assessed as the highest plasma dilution with an absolute value for CD107a expression by NK cell greater than one and a fold-change of CD107a expression by NK cells greater than two compared to uninfected cells. Hemagglutination inhibition = HAI. higher dilutions for high HAI titer plasmas compared to low or middle titer samples. At a 1:200 dilution of plasma the NK cell degranulation assay demonstrated a positive correlation (r = 0.8526) between the absolute value of CD107a response and the fold increase of CD107a response (Fig. 5B ). At serum dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:5000, the correlation between the absolute value and the fold increase were both r = 0.97. This indicates a relationship between the two values and the utility of both for determination of the NK cell titer. MFI of Ag/Ab binding/opsonization on target cells also was positively correlated with fold increase of CD107a response at 1:200 dilution of plasma (Fig. 5C ). This indicates the importance of Ag/Ab binding for elicitation of NK cell degranulation.

Using a Tc bovine IVIG sample (HAI 1280) we determined opsonization of infected and uninfected Raji cells in our assay (Fig. 6A ). NK cell CD107a expression for infected and uninfected target cells was determined over dilution of IVIG (Fig. 6B ). At 1:200 dilution Tc bovine IVIG demonstrated just under 10% NK cell degranulation when cultured with infected target cells. Using this information, the NK cell degranulation titer for Tc bovine IVIG was determined to be 1:5000 (Table 1 ). The titer of Abs capable of stimulating NK cell activation was assessed by determining the fold increase of the NK cell response (Fig. 6C ) and the absolute value of the NK cell response (Fig. 6D) .

Using titer information for the human plasma sample set and the Tc bovine IVIG we conducted a Spearman correlation analysis and determined that a positive relationship exists between HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer (Fig. 7) . Taken together, this data suggests that a positive correlation exists between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation can be detected in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 (particularly at low plasma dilutions) and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers.

In this report, we demonstrate a non-radioactive assay for determining concentrations of ADCC NK cell activating antibodies in human serum or plasma by their ability to activate NK cells as demonstrated by degranulation (CD107a expression). We further support that the titer of HA hemagglutination antibodies positively correlates with NK cell activation in our sample set, athough NK activation varied widely amongst low, middle, and high HAI titer plasma samples. Furthermore, we report that influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG was determined to have sustained antibody titers capable of eliciting NK cell degranulation.

Titers of hemagglutination antibodies against the globular head of the HA receptor of influenza viruses is a current correlate of protection from influenza virus infection. Generally, a titer of 1:40 is considered protective (Co et al., 2014; Baz et al., 2013) . However, this varies widely amongst individuals. Children, in particular, usually have experienced less exposure, and tend to require higher titers of around 1:110 to incur a 50% protective rate (Black et al., 2011) . Protective titers can vary even among individuals in similar age ranges (Co et al., 2014) . The HAI assay, which screens for hemagglutination inhibition, is the current means to predict protection. However, this metric has its limitations. In addition to the aforementioned unpredictable and varying range of titers required to incur immunity among individuals, HAI assays determine levels of hemagglutination against the HA globular head alone. The activities of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies against the HA stalk, or other viral proteins such as the ion channel matrix protein, nucleoprotein or neuraminidase are not detected by this assay. Routine evaluation of vaccine-induced antibody responses and determination of protective titers will potentially benefit from utilizing additional influenza assays such as NI, MN, and ADCC assays. The MN assay, for instance, has demonstrated utility for evaluating influenza serostatus of individuals and evaluating protective titers against seasonal influenza (Verschoor et al., 2015) . Importantly, other immune responses, such as ADCC, have been established as vital in providing protection against influenza viruses (Greenberg et al., 1979; Jegaskanda et al., 2013a Jegaskanda et al., , 2016 Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Co et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d; Srivastava et al., 2013; DiLillo et al., 2014; Simhadri et al., 2015) .

We have demonstrated an NK cell degranulation assay, as a metric for ADCC activity, utilizing influenza-infected Raji cells as targets. Consistent with previous reports utilizing Raji cells as targets for ADCC activity, we have found Raji cells to have high percentage of infection by influenza (Srivastava et al., 2013) . We have shown that Raji cells are infected by H1N1pdm09 and express HA antigens at a high rate (∼62.3%). Opsonization results comparing infected and uninfected We utilized Raji cells, instead of A549 cells, which have previously been used for influenza ADCC assays, as they are non-adherent and are convenient for highthroughput flow-based assays. A commercially available non-radioactive ADCC reporter assay has been recently developed by Promega (ADCC Reporter Bioassay Core Kit) (Surowy et al., 2012) , which has utilized Jurkat effector cells and Raji target cells, further demonstrating the utility of Raji cells for ADCC assays.

The assay described in this report is relevant as we explore NK cell degranulation (CD107a expression) as the result of binding with opsonized antigen on the surface of infected target cells. Previously, NK cell activity/ADCC activity has been detected using chromium-51 ( 51 Cr) labeling (Greenberg et al., 1979; Co et al., 2014) or by sera/plasmatreating ELISA plates coated with purified viral proteins (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a (Jegaskanda et al., , 2014a (Jegaskanda et al., ,b, 2013b Vanderven et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Florek et al., 2014; Jegaskanda et al., 2013d) , including the use of FcγR dimer-binding assays Wines et al., 2016) . Major advantages the method described herein has over 51 Cr labeling includes the removal of radioactive material and increased Fig. 7 . Correlation of HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer for human plasma set and the transchromosomic bovine IVIG therapeutic. NK cell titer is assessed as the highest plasma dilution with an absolute value for CD107a expression by NK cell greater than one and a fold-change of CD107a expression by NK cells compared to uninfected cells greater than two. NK cell titer is compared to hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer. Correlation coefficient, r, equals 0.6072 and p value equals 0.0008 indicating a positive correlation. All 27 samples are plotted (several samples are overlapping). For Low10 and High8 NK cell degranulation titer was set at 50. Statistical results are from a non-parametric Spearman correlation analysis (two-tailed).

B.J. Morrison et al. Journal of Virological Methods 248 (2017) 7-18 sensitivity as 51 Cr assays often demonstrate low sensitivity and spontaneous release of the isotope from non-lysed target cells (Zaritskaya et al., 2010) . ELISA-based approaches lend themselves well to highthroughput assays. While the method of coating ELISA plates with purified antigen also removes the radioactivity hazard, it also has limitations. The plate-coating method is an excellent means to select for specific antibodies against a given antigen in serum or plasma; however, it removes effector cell interaction with opsonized antigen on an infected cell. Our method returns this cell to cell interaction using Raji cells as the target. In addition, other components in plasma, as well as on the cell surface, may affect binding affinity between the Fc region and the receptors on effector cells − variables that are removed altogether when antibodies are purified and/or presented with purified antigen alone Srivastava et al., 2013; Wren et al., 2013) . NK cell activation is controlled by a balance of inhibitory and activating signals (Moretta et al., 2001) , and a further advantage of the method described herein is that it could allow for future studies that more deeply assess this NK cell activation/inhibition balance in the setting of influenza-infected target cells and ADCC. Our use of a target cell provides a sound model for assessing the process of ADCC priming in the context of infection with influenza. Furthermore, this method is consistent with reproducibility demonstrated for both opsonization and CD107a degranulation of effector cells (Fig. 3) . Future studies will be needed to determine how well the Raji target cell assay described herein correlates with ELISA-based, including FcγR dimer-binding, assays.

Using our plasma set we demonstrated a positive correlation between NK cell degranulation and HAI titer. However, it should be noted that this correlation was conducted with a relatively small set of samples, and that the relationship between HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer is more complicated than the demonstrated correlation herein presented. In our set, plasma with higher HAI titer tended to demonstrate higher ability to sustain NK cell activity/NK degranulation titer. However, NK cell activation was observed in plasma with HAI titers lower than the suggested protective titer of HAI 40. In addition, NK cell activation varied in persons with high HAI titers with endpoint titers ranging from < 1:200 to 1:25,000. This is consistent with what has been previously reported in regards to a weak correlation between HAI and ADCC antibody titers (Zhong et al., 2016; Co et al., 2014) , in addition to what we have observed over multiple experiments. Of particular note, Plasma1 (HAI 1280) and Plasma2 (HAI 640) had vastly different abilities to stimulate NK cell degranulation. Despite having a higher HAI titer than Plasma2, Plasma1 was a poorer inducer of ADCC. This suggests that HAI titers do not strongly correlate with ADCC titers. Recent evidence suggests that HAI-inducing antibodies do not optimally induce ADCC activity Leon et al., 2016) . There have also been reports indicating the presence of cross-reactive ADCC-mediating Ab titers in influenza-seropositive individuals without detectable NAb titers (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a; Jegaskanda et al., 2013c; Terajima et al., 2015) . In aggregate these reports suggests that HAI, a surrogate for NAb titer, does not in all cases correlate with ADCC-mediating Ab titer, and HAI-inducing antibodies may in fact block the induction of ADCC by other antibodies . The correlation we determined between HAI titer and NK cell degranulation titer may be attributed to the overall higher titers of influenza-specific antibodies present in the high HAI samples compared to the low HAI samples. Finally, we have observed a mild correlation between Ag/Ab binding intensity to the surface of infected cells and the NK cell degranulation activity. This suggests that for serum/plasma with or without a protective HAI titer, the opsonization to infected cells is essential for the sample's ADCC activity.

Pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) has demonstrated mortality for critically ill patients of up to 15% (Webb et al., 2009 ). As such development of alternative therapies, in addition to vaccination, is warranted for preparation for future pandemic strains of influenza. Influenza passive immunotherapy treatments include use of convalescent plasma, hyperimmune immunoglobulins, or monoclonal antibody therapies. Convalescent patient blood products have demonstrated utility in reducing mortality associated with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic (Luke et al., 2006) and for treatment of H5N1 influenza (Zhou et al., 2007) . In response to the rapid need to generate human antibodies for passive immunotherapy against pandemic strains of influenza monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune human-derived immunoglobulins are not ideal due to economic, logistic, and time factors. One potential source for rapidly producing fully human polyclonal antibodies for passive immunotherapy is the Tc bovine system. Vaccinated Tc bovines can produce convalescent plasma pools from which human IgG can be purified (150-600 g of Tc human IgG per animal per month). Using our assay and assessing an influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapeutic, NK cell degranulation was specific for virally-infected cells and demonstrated a high titer of NK degranulation antibodies (1:5000). Any additional benefits of influenzavaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapy compared to human IVIG therapeutics and bovine colostrum IgG therapeutics will need to be further assessed. However, influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapy deserves additional evaluation as a potential therapeutic for critically ill H1N1-infected patients. This therapy has the ability to initiate ADCC antibody responses, which is an important mechanism of protection in already infected patients.

The NK cell degranulation assay described here has relevance to global surveilance of influenza. ADCC-mediated responses to influenza can recognize a broader range of influenza strains than neutralizing antibodies, that generally target a more highly variable region of influenza proteins (Jegaskanda et al., 2014a) . ADCC-mediating antibodies have been demonstrated to the 2009 novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) prior to the 2009 pandemic in individuals greater than 45 years of age who did not have detectable HAI titers (Jegaskanda et al., 2013a) . Furthermore, in studies where NAbs were not detected to A(H1N1)pdm09, non-NAbs titers correlated with protection from severe infection (O'Donnell et al., 2012; Weinfurter et al., 2011) . This demonstrates the utility of assays for assessing ADCC for global influenza surveillance and population immunity. Use of ADCC assays may also drive a shift away from solely assessing the role of neutralizing or HAI-mediating Abs for vaccine efficacy and antibody passive immunotherapuetic assessment. ADCC-mediating Abs can target internal proteins of influenza virus . Targets of ADCC include: (i) HA (Zhong et al., 2016) ; (ii) the intracellular nucleoprotein antigen (Jegaskanda et al., 2017) , that has been shown to be transiently expressed on virally infected cell surface (Yewdell et al., 1981) ; and (iii) neurominidase and matrix-2 proteins (Terajima et al., 2015) . Vaccine induction or therapeutic production of antibodies that target influenza internal proteins via ADCC response may prove to be a new development for influenza vaccine/treatment design.

In conclusion, ADCC is a vital immune response in controlling influenza infections, and is a metric that should be assessed for broad spectrum influenza vaccines or influenza passive immunotherapy approaches. ADCC assessment is also a vital tool for conducting serosurveillance of influenza investigations in order to better assess the breadth of antibody responses to epidemic/pandemic and seasonal influenza. This could be especially relevant in assessing influenza exposure or protective immune repsonse in non/low-neutralizing patient plasma. The NK cell activation assay demonstrated in this report could be of use: (i) for future research investigations into the role of ADCC against influenza, possibly predicting patient clinical response; (ii) as a metric of vaccine immune response; (iii) as a tool to assess ADCC activity in patient plasma globally; and (iv) as a tool to assess immunoglobulin products such as Tc bovine IVIG.

Development of Novel DNA-Encoded PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibodies as Lipid-Lowering Therapeutics,"Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is one of the major contributors to cardiovascular heart disease (CHD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Due to severe side effects of statins, alternative treatment strategies are required for statin-intolerant patients. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have shown great efficacy in LDL-C reduction. Limitations for this approach include the need for multiple injections as well as increased costs associated with patient management. Here, we engineered a DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) targeting PCSK9 (daPCSK9), as an alternative approach to protein-based lipid-lowering therapeutics, and we characterized its expression and activity. A single intramuscular administration of mouse daPCSK9 generated expression in vivo for over 42 days that corresponded with a substantial decrease of 28.6% in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and 10.3% in total cholesterol by day 7 in wild-type mice. Repeated administrations of the DMAb plasmid led to increasing expression, with DMAb levels of 7.5 mg/mL at day 62. daPCSK9 therapeutics may provide a novel, simple, less frequent, cost-effective approach to reducing LDL-C, either as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other LDL-lowering therapeutics for synergistic effect.","Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death, accounting for more than 800,000 deaths in the United States and 17.3 million deaths globally. 1 Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been found to be one of the major contributors to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular heart disease (CHD). [2] [3] [4] Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated total cholesterol that is primarily LDL-C. It has been associated with premature cardiovascular disease, often resulting in death at a young age. Lipid-lowering medications and LDL apheresis, especially for statin-intolerant patients, have been used for the management of familial hypercholesterolemia. 5, 6 Better pharmacological therapeutics are needed to achieve and maintain the desired target LDL-C levels.

Proprotein convertases are secretory mammalian serine proteases that induce site-specific proteolytic cleavage in proteins. This is a form of irreversible post-translational modification, which can lead to the activation or inactivation of proteins, such as growth factors, receptors, hormones, transcription factors, bacterial toxins, and viral glycoproteins. They have major implications in health and for disease due to their broad biological roles. 7 Several modulators and inhibitors of proprotein convertases are being developed for hypercholesterolemia (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ), viral infections (Furin, PACE4, and SKI-1 inhibitors [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , and cancer immunotherapy (Furin and PACE4 inhibitors [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , as well as for use as a non-steroidal male contraceptive (PC4 inhibitors 31, 32 ).

PCSK9 is a serine protease that belongs to the family of mammalian proprotein convertases. PCSK9 cleaves itself to form the catalytically inactive PCSK9 protein and a prosegment, which remains associated as a complex. The PCSK9-prosegment complex interacts with lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), leading to its internalization and degradation. This decrease of LDLR on the hepatocyte surface results in decreased clearance of LDL particles from the circulation. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PCSK9 leading to higher LDL-C levels have been reported to be associated with hypercholesterolemia and with an increased risk of CHD. 34, 38, 39 Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, on the other hand, have been correlated with decreased LDL-C and reduced CHD risk. In rare cases, severe LOF mutations that produce no detectable PCSK9 protein have been reported, exhibiting LDL-C levels around 15 mg/dL, and, interestingly, such individuals are identified without negative effects. 7, 40, 41 Such individuals validate PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention.

PCSK9 inhibitors have emerged as a novel approach for the treatment of dyslipidemia. They are primarily being used for high-risk cardiovascular patients, including familial hypercholesterolemia cases, those who have managed LDL-C but are at high risk of plaque progression, and people who are statin intolerant. Around 5%-10% of patients treated with statins exhibit adverse side effects, such as muscle pain, weakness, and rhabdomyolysis. [42] [43] [44] [45] Some approaches for PCSK9 inhibition involve monoclonal antibodies, 46-51 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), 13, 52 anti-sense oligonucleotides, 53, 54 adnectins, 55 small molecules, [56] [57] [58] [59] peptide mimetics, [60] [61] [62] and vaccines. [63] [64] [65] Currently there are two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab (Regeneron and Sanofi) and evolocumab (Amgen), both of which are fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting PCSK9. Clinical trials on highrisk cardiovascular patients have demonstrated their efficacy in reducing LDL-C. In the RUTHERFORD-2 clinical trial on heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, treatment with evolocumab (140 mg/2 weeks or 420 mg/month) resulted in a 60%-65% decrease in LDL-C levels. More than 60% of the patients were able to reach their LDL-C goal of 70 mg/dL. 66 In the ODYSSEY HIGH clinical trial on familial hypercholesterolemia patients treated with alirocumab (75/150 mg every 2 weeks), 57% of those with difficultto-treat severe familial hypercholesterolemia were able to reach their LDL-C goal of 100 mg/dL. 67 Moreover, when alirocumab was administered to statin-treated patients, they achieved significantly greater reductions in LDL-C than those who doubled their dose of statin or received the addition of ezetimibe. [67] [68] [69] [70] Cost is a major limitation in the clinical management of high-risk cardiovascular patients. Biological products such as recombinant mAbs are complex and expensive to manufacture. Evolocumab and alirocumab are projected to cost around $14,350 per year per patient. 71 A recent analysis on the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors for use in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients found that these inhibitors are poorly cost-effective and that a 71% reduction in price is needed to reach the patient willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 72 In addition to the high cost, current anti-PCSK9 recombinant antibodies require frequent administration, such as injections every 2 weeks. Development of more cost-effective, longer-lived, and potent pharmacologic interventions would provide an avenue for making such therapeutics more widely available for high-risk cardiovascular patients.

Compared to other therapeutic approaches, with in vivo electroporation technology, the plasmid DNA is delivered transiently and is not integrated, therefore allowing for repeat administration without any adverse consequences. Furthermore, with the recombinant protein therapy approach, numerous repeat administrations are required, which generally come at a high financial cost to the patient. With the DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) platform it is possible to administer therapeutics repeatedly without facing challenges such as pre-existing immunity, difficult manufacturing processes, or high cost. DMAb technology represents a new approach for a direct in vivo production of biologically active immunoglobulins in a patient in a non-permanent fashion. Low-voltage electropermeabilization allows for robust plasmid DNA delivery into tissue where the delivered plasmid containing an encoded antibody sequence can now drive transcription and in vivo translation of the desired protein. While there have been a few recent reports describing adaptations of this technology as an approach to specific infectious diseases or cancer targets, [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] there have not been reports of utilizing this approach for in vivo chronic disease therapy.

Here we developed a DMAb approach ( Figure 1A ) targeting PCSK9 based on engineering a plasmid DNA to encode a novel anti-PCSK9 mAb as a single insert expression cassette, named daPCSK9 (labeled HdaPCSK9 [human] or MdaPCSK9 [mouse], respectively bearing human or mouse Fc regions). In vivo daPCSK9 plasmid administration using electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection was performed to evaluate anti-PCSK9 DMAb production kinetics and the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibition on lipid reduction in vivo. Robust production of anti-PCSK9 DMAb began within days of administration, with peak levels of antibody achieved by 1 week post-injection. PCSK9 DMAb could be detected in sera for up to 2 months, and levels could be boosted with additional administrations. In vivo-produced anti-PCSK9 DMAb retained its ability to bind to its target. An increase in LDLR was detected upon in vivo administration and expression of daPCSK9. This was accompanied by significant reductions in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and total cholesterol levels in both C57BL/6 and nude mice studies. These observations support an exciting proof of principle for further study utilizing daPCSK9 DMAb approaches for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.

The mouse anti-PCSK9 (IgG2a) was designed in a single linked heavyand light-chain cassette to be expressed from a single open reading frame, with the heavy-and light-chain genes separated by a previously developed furin/P2A cleavage site ( Figure 1B ) to provide efficient protein processing necessary for immunoglobulin G (IgG) production in vivo. A cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in the pVax-1 vector was used to drive the expression of the antibodies, and the final construct was designated MdaPCSK9. At 72 hr after plasmid transfection into HEK293T cells, secreted antibody expression in supernatants was determined to be 831 ng/mL for MdaPCSK9 (Figure 2A ). Western blot-binding studies, using supernatants from MdaPCSK9 DMAbtransfected cells, showed specific binding to both human and mouse recombinant PCSK9 antigens, with greater binding detected to human PCSK9 ( Figure 2B ). This showed proper binding activity of MdaPCSK9 against the PCSK9 antigen. Fluorescence microscopy was also used to demonstrate MdaPCSK9 expression in Hepa1-6 cells ( Figure 2C) , and it showed a strong expression of MdaPCSK9 in DMAb plasmid-transfected, but not control, pVax1-transfected cells.

The expression level and duration of the daPCSK9 DMAbs were evaluated in C57BL/6J wild-type and nude B6.Cg-foxn1nu/J mice www.moleculartherapy.org (Jackson Laboratory) ( Figure 3 ). Plasmid DNA (100 or 300 mg) was injected intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior muscle, followed by electroporation (IM-EP). daPCSK9 with a mouse backbone demonstrated high expression with a long duration. MdaPCSK9 levels reached a maximum mean of 2,902 ng/mL at day 14, and they persisted for over 6 weeks, with blood levels at 1,649 ng/mL on day 42. In nude mice, the MdaPCSK9 expression was higher, reaching a maximum mean of 4,923 ng/mL at day 21, and expression persisted through the last bleed at day 42. Sequential administration of mouse DMAbs at days 0, 21, and 42 resulted in continuous increases in DMAb expression, with MdaPCSK9 levels reaching 7,521 ng/mL (3 Â 100 mg doses) on day 62 ( Figure 3C ). This highlights the sustainability of DMAb expression over long periods. Improved MdaPCSK9 expression was observed when doses were spread out over several-week periods, simplifying administration.

PCSK9 inhibition was determined using western blot analysis of LDLR expression levels in mouse liver sections ( Figure 4A ). Mouse livers were harvested at day 5, and the LDLR expression was evaluated by comparing the human and MdaPCSK9-treated mice to pVax-1 control mice. Western blot analysis showed that LDLR expression levels were significantly higher for PCSK9 DMAb-treated mice than control mice. ELISA protein quantification was used to detect the presence of DMAbs in the livers of treated mice. DMAb levels were 185 ng/mg tissue for MdaPCSK9 ( Figure 4B ). Binding western blot analysis was used to evaluate the binding of DMAbs from serum samples of DMAb-treated and untreated mice to human and mouse PCSK9 protein ( Figure 4C ). After incubation of the serum samples with blots containing the recombinant mouse or human PCSK9 proteins, the sera of DMAb-treated mice reacted with the PCSK9 protein, but sera from the pVax-1-treated mice did not. Furthermore, MdaPCSK9 were evaluated on a human liver cell line, Huh7; 72 hr after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry ( Figure 4D ). There were significant increases in LDLR levels in the MdaPCSK9-treated group, with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) increasing from 1,573 in the control group to 11,166 in the DMAbtreated group. The results demonstrate the functional efficacy of daPCSK9 at inhibiting PCSK9 protein from inducing LDLR degradation in hepatocytes.

The lipid-lowering capability of daPCSK9 was evaluated in C57BL/6J wild-type and B6.Cg-foxn1nu/J nude mice ( Figure 5 ). For accurate calculations of lipid reductions in the treated group, percentage decreases were analyzed against the control group for each day. In C57BL/6J mice, a significant 28.6% decrease in non-HDL-C was detected on day 7 for the MdaPCSK9 group. By day 14, there was a 30% decrease in non-HDL-C for the MdaPCSK9 group. Total cholesterol reductions were also observed for the MdaPCSK9 group, with a 14% decrease on day 14. In nude mice, there was a significant 32.5% reduction in non-HDL-C on day 14 for those treated with MdaPCSK9. This reduction persisted until day 21. There were similar reductions in total cholesterol that persisted to day 21, with a 14.3% decrease. The persistent reduction of non-HDL-C and total cholesterol in the mouse models correlates with the DMAb expression in the circulation. Repeated administrations of MdaPCSK9 led to increasing DMAb expression kinetics over a period of 62 days, with reductions in non-HDL-C of 20.9% from pooled sera on days 56 and 62 ( Figures 5E and 5F ).

Construction and Evaluation of Human Anti-PCSK9 DMAb daPCSK9 plasmid engineered to express either human or mouse Fc regions (labeled HdaPCSK9 and MdaPCSK9, respectively) were designed to evaluate the effect on expression levels and kinetics in vivo. Evaluation of HdaPCSK9 in HEK293T cells showed the DMAb expression levels at 1,349 ng/mL ( Figure S1 ). Strong expression for HdaPCSK9 was also confirmed in Hepa1-6 cells by using fluorescence microscopy after intracellular staining with anti-human IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Western blot-binding studies with the HdaPCSK9 demonstrated binding to both recombinant human and mouse PCSK9 proteins.

HdaPCSK9 expression levels and kinetics were analyzed in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6J and nude B6.Cg-foxn1nu/J mice ( Figures 6A  and 6B) . After a single intramuscular administration of 300 mg plasmid DNA, the HdaPCSK9 reached a maximum mean of 2,224 ng/mL protein mAbs at day 14 in nude mice. In wild-type mice, there was an acute immune reaction to the DMAbs containing human Fc, resulting in drops in DMAb expression by day 7. Maximum expression was observed at day 5, with a mean of around 2,485 ng/mL for the 300 mg dose of HdaPCSK9. The results of human DMAb studies in wild-type mice demonstrate the importance of considering intraspecies differences in antibody evaluation and how this may impact translation to other models. The reason for the resulting drop in expression of human PCSK9 DMAb is interesting. It is possible that immunogenicity or other factors could be involved, which will be investigated in future studies. The functional activity of sera DMAbs was confirmed by binding western blot analysis, showing binding to both recombinant mouse and human PCSK9 proteins ( Figure 6C ).

Anti-PCSK9 DMAb expression was also confirmed in vivo by immunohistochemistry analysis of mouse muscle tissue at day 5. As shown in Figure 6D , immunohistochemistry using HdaPCSK9 immunostained with anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) indicates positive browning in the mouse tibialis anterior muscle section, compared to no browning in the control pVax-1 muscle sections. H&E staining of the DMAb-treated and control groups showed no signs of tissue damage. This confirms the expression of anti-PCSK9 DMAbs and the lack of tissue damage caused by their administration.

The HdaPCSK9 performed similarly to MdaPCSK9 in its capacity at lipid reduction in C57BL/6J wild-type and B6.Cg-foxn1nu/J nude mice ( Figure S2 ). In wild-type mice, there was a significant 23.8% decrease in non-HDL-C detected on day 7 for the HdaPCSK9 group and a 30% reduction by day 14. Total cholesterol reduction was also observed, with a 14% decrease on day 14. Compared to HdaPCSK9, MdaPCSK9 demonstrated better reductions of both non-HDL-C and total cholesterol, which correlates with its superior expression levels and duration in the circulation in the matched species. In nude mice, there were significant reductions in non-HDL-C on day 14 for both species' antibodies, with 28.6% for human and 32.5% for mouse anti-PCSK9 DMAb groups. This reduction persisted until the final endpoint at day 21. There were similar reductions in total cholesterol that persisted until day 21, with a 15.2% decrease for the HdaPCSK9. Although they were not expressed as well in mouse as MdaPCSK9, the human DMAb performed well at lipid reduction in this short-term study supporting potential application of the human Fc DMAbs in a matched species setting.

Individuals with elevated LDL-C or those afflicted with hereditary familial hypercholesterolemia are at increased risk for CHD. LDL-C reduction therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, such as statins, has been a standard treatment for reducing the risk of CHD, but intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms can prevent their use. 78 Alternative therapies are needed when the gold standard for reducing high LDL-C causes such adverse effects. PCSK9 inhibitors are emerging as a potent important new approach for reducing LDL-C by increasing its hepatic clearance via the LDLR.

Several strategies have been taken to inhibit PCSK9, with mAbs achieving recent success. Evolocumab and alirocumab are two FDA-approved anti-PCSK9 recombinant mAbs that have shown significant LDL-C reduction. Various recombinant anti-PCSK9 antibodies have been investigated in mice for their lipid-lowering capabilities. Zhang et al. 9 developed a transgenic cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)/LDLR-hemi mouse model that expressed human CETP transgene and one copy of the LDLR, to mimic healthy human lipid levels in mice. After 48 hr of a single intravenous administration of the anti-PCSK9 antibody at 1.1 mg/kg, there was a 29% reduction from the baseline in LDL-C, with serum antibody levels of 3.5 mg/mL. This correlates with expression levels and the lipid reduction capability observed with the DMAbs. There was even a sig-nificant 50%-70% reduction in LDL-C at higher administered recombinant antibody doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. 9 Chan et al. evaluated an anti-PCSK9 antibody in wild-type mice and LDLR-knockout mice, and they observed a 36% reduction in total cholesterol 3 days after administration to the wild-type mice, while detecting no change in the LDLR-knockout mice. 8 Another group examined the effect of an anti-PCSK9 antibody on humanized hyperlipidemic Pcsk9 hum/hum Ldlr À/+ mice on a carbohydrate-rich diet. The anti-PCSK9 antibody REGN727 reduced LDL-C to a prediet level within 24 hr. It was also found to be effective in cynomolgus monkeys, with up to a 75% reduction in LDL-C for over 20 days after a single intravenous administration. 79 Recombinant anti-PCSK9 mAbs have shown success, but a major limiting factor to their use is their high cost. Moreover, they require frequent dosing, such as every 2 weeks used for recombinant anti-PCSK9 antibody therapeutics. Here we developed a novel approach to inhibit PCSK9 using DMAb technology. DMAbs have several advantages that make them an important new technology for the development of protein-based therapeutics, such as cost-effectiveness, ease of manufacturing, stability, and no requirement for a cold chain and rapid development and engineering. DMAbs can be delivered via intramuscular or intradermal routes via in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA. Low-voltage electroporation leads to consistent intracellular delivery of the injected plasmid DNA. Our DMAb platform has shown protective efficacy against several viral pathogens, including HIV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Zika among others, and it is currently under evaluation for immunotherapeutics against cancers. [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] In this study, we used a CELLECTRA in vivo electroporation device, which utilizes an adaptive constant current electroporation system that can measure tissue resistance and adjust in real time to prevent any tissue damage and enhance DNA uptake. For DNA delivery, electroporation has been able to allow 1,000-fold enhancement in gene expression in vivo. There have been several impactful clinical studies performed using this in vivo electroporation technology. One example is the human papilloma virus (HPV) VGX-3100 DNA vaccine, which showed efficacy in phase IIb clinical trials, demonstrating robust antigen-specific T cell response, as well as inducing clearance of the HPV virus and lesions. 80 Another example is the development of the Zika virus DNA vaccine reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2017. 81 In a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of DNA vaccine GLS-5700, healthy adults demonstrated development of both binding and neutralizing antibodies, associated with protection in animal models. 81 In our study, the mouse PCSK9 DMAb was capable of expression for over 42 days in wild-type mice. Expression for several months has been demonstrated with several DMAbs, such as Anti-Dengue, 73 Anit-Ebola (A.P., unpublished data), and the immunoadhesin eCD4-Ig. 82 These studies support the potential of DMAbs, some lasting several months, to be administered as a possible treatment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Here we evaluated the efficacy of the anti-PCSK9 DMAb platform for its ability to express anti-PCSK9 antibodies directly in vivo and to exhibit lipid-lowering properties in mice. An anti-PCSK9 DMAb (MdaPCSK9) that used a mouse-matched backbone was found to express for at least 6 weeks in vivo at reasonable levels. Importantly, inhibition of PCSK9 was observed in vivo, showing elevated liver LDLR expression 5 days after treatment. With a single intramuscular administration of anti-PCSK9 DMAbs (300 mg plasmid DNA), we observed reductions in analyses were carried out on mice sera using the VITROS 350 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. Percent changes were calculated for each day relative to control pVax-1-treated mice. Statistical differences are indicated relative to day 0 of treatment. Data are expressed as ± SEM (n = 5). Statistical differences were measured using two-way ANOVA tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001; n.s., not significant).

non-HDL-C and total cholesterol with both mouse and human anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Significant reductions in non-HDL-C were observed with MdaPCSK9 as early as day 7 post-administration in wild-type and nude mice. Compared to wild-type pVax-1 negative controls, there was a 28.6% reduction on day 7 for the MdaPCSK9 group. Both human and mouse anti-PCSK9 DMAbs led to 30% decreases in non-HDL-C and 14% reductions in total cholesterol by day 14. Wild-type mice, which are normocholesterolemic, were used in the current study, and it is difficult to observe significant decreases in LDL levels in these mice as compared to transgenic hypercholesterolemic mice. Future studies with transgenic hypercholesterolemic mice are important for evaluation of the PCSK9 DMAbs.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate the efficacy of highly novel anti-PCSK9 DMAbs at reducing non-HDL-C and total cholesterol, and they suggest the potential of this new technology in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and familial hypercholesterolemia patients. These novel DNA-produced, antibody-based therapeutics could be valuable as an alternative method of therapy of treatment for hypercholesterolemia and other cardiovascular diseases.

HEK293T, mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6, and human Huh-7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco-Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).

DMAb plasmids were designed to encode human or mouse anti-PCSK9 mAbs. DMAb transgenes were designed in a single open reading frame, with the variable and constant heavy chains separated from variable and constant light chains by a furin/P2A cleavage site. Two constructs were developed: a human anti-PCSK9 DMAb (HdaPCSK9) on an IgG1 backbone, and a mouse anti-PCSK9 DMAb (MdaPCSK9) on an IgG2a backbone. DMAb transgenes were flanked with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites and synthesized by GenScript for subcloning into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites in a pVax-1 mammalian expression vector. Human CMV immediate-early promoter in the pVax-1 vector was used to drive the expression of the antibodies.

HEK293T, Hepa1-6, or Huh7 cells were transfected with anti-PCSK9 DMAb plasmids using lipofectamine LTX reagent and following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 Â 10 5 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and incubated in a 37 C incubator with 5% CO 2 . Cells were transfected with 1 mg DMAb plasmid at 70% confluence and incubated for a maximum of 72 hr. DMAb expression following transfection was analyzed by western blot, ELISA, and immunofluorescence microscopy.

A binding western blot analysis was performed to evaluate anti-PCSK9 DMAb-binding capability. Recombinant human or mouse PCSK9 protein (0.5-5 mg) was run in precast Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) under nonreducing conditions. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) transfer membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 hr, then stained overnight at 4 C with either supernatant from DMAb-transfected cells or serum from DMAb-treated mice, and compared to those of pVax-1-negative control samples. Membranes were washed with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Subsequently, membranes were stained with either anti-human or anti-mouse IgG 680RD antibody (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and washed in PBST. Membranes were scanned on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imager. 50 mg total sample protein was loaded in gels and run as described above for the analysis of liver lysates for LDLR expression. Membranes were stained with an anti-mLDLR primary antibody (AF2255; R&D Systems). Actin was stained using an anti-actin primary antibody (ab198991; Abcam) and an anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody.

DMAbs with human backbones were quantified by an ELISA for total human IgG. ELISA MaxiSorp plates were coated with 1 mg/well antihuman IgG-Fc fragment antibody (A80-104A; Bethyl Laboratories) overnight at 4 C. Plates were blocked in 10% FBS in PBS for 1 hr at RT. Samples and recombinant human IgG standards were added to the plate for 1 hr at RT. After washing the plates, anti-human IgG-Fc fragment antibody-HRP (A80-104P; Bethyl Laboratories) was added for 1 hr at RT. SigmaFast OPD (Sigma-Aldrich) substrate solution was used for sample detection. Optical density was measured at 450 nm using a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega). For quantification of DMAbs with mouse backbones from cell super-natants, plates were coated with anti-mouse IgG-Fc fragment antibody (A90-131A; Bethyl Laboratories). Anti-mouse IgG-HRP (62-6520; Invitrogen) was used for detection. Serum samples of DMAbs with a mouse backbone were differentiated from background mouse IgGs by coating ELISA plates with recombinant PCSK9 protein. Purified recombinant anti-PCSK9 mAb was used as the standard. Quantitative ELISA data are expressed as ± SEM (n = 3).

Hepa1-6 cells were transfected with anti-PCSK9 DMAbs using lipofectamine LTX reagent as described above. 48 hr after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Cells were then washed and incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC (A80-319F; Bethyl Laboratories) for 1 hr. After washing, cells were stained with DAPI nuclear stain and imaged on an EVOS FL Imaging System.

Flow cytometry was used for the detection of LDLR on Huh7 cells transfected with control pVax-1 or anti-PCSK9 DMAb plasmids. 72 hr post-transfection, cells were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (3% FBS in PBS) and stained with anti-LDLR primary antibody (ab52818; Abcam) for 1 hr at 4 C, followed by anti-rabbit IgG-FITC secondary antibody (ab6717; Abcam) for 1 hr at 4 C. Cells were washed 3 times in FACS buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were analyzed on an LSR18 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Immunohistochemistry was performed by The Wistar Institute Histotechnology Facility. Briefly, mouse anterior tibialis muscle sections were resected and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded samples were treated with antigen retrieval reagent and deparaffinized. Slides were then fixed with acetone and washed with PBS, followed by blocking and staining the sections with anti-human IgG antibody-HRP.

Evaluation of DMAbs was carried out in 6-to 8-week-old C57BL/6J wild-type and nude B6.Cg-foxn1nu/J mice. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the NIH and The Wistar Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IA-CUC). Mice were injected with plasmid DNA in the tibialis anterior or quadricep muscles. In vivo electroporation was performed using a CELLECTRA adaptive constant-current EP device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals). Triangular 3-electrode arrays consisting of 26G solid stainless steel electrodes were used to deliver square-wave pulses. Two constant-current pulses were delivered at 0.1 A for 52 ms/pulse, separated with a 1-s delay between pulses. Mice were given either 100 or 300 mg plasmid DNA resuspended in water. The plasmids were co-formulated with recombinant hyaluronidase to enhance their intramuscular distribution. A maximum of 30 mL volume was used at each injection site. pVax-1 empty vector was used as a negative control for DMAbs. Blood was collected by submandibular bleeding for DMAb quantification and lipid panel analysis. Samples were collected until day 42 or 62.

Lipid panel analysis was carried out using a VITROS 350 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. Mice were fasted for 4 hr and bled by submandibular bleeding. Serum samples collected from whole blood were used for the lipid panel analysis. Mouse non-HDL-C levels were calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total cholesterol.

Experimental data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA tests. Differences were deemed significant at p values < 0.05. All graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 6 software.

Preclinical safety and tolerability of a repeatedly administered human leishmaniasis DNA vaccine,"The leishmaniases are a complex of vector-borne diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. LEISHDNAVAX is a multi-antigen, T-cell epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis. The vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies. Here, we describe the safety testing of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice and rats, complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in Leishmania-infected mice. Biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal (i.d.) administration to rats. DNA vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections. Although vector DNA was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection, it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes. Evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i.d. administration to naive, non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns. LEISHDNAVAX was also well tolerated in Leishmania-infected mice. Taken together, our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of LEISHDNAVAX in both naive and infected animals and thus, support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine.","The leishmaniases are a complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania with up to 1.6 million cases reported worldwide annually 1 and~350 million people at risk to develop leishmaniasis. 2 It is estimated that the most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), causes up to 40 000 deaths per year. 1 Measures to control transmission of the parasite were of limited success to date. Despite advances in treatment of VL over the last decade, drug toxicity and heat stability, difficult routes of administration and variation in drug efficacy between endemic areas remain issues to be fully solved. A preventive and therapeutic leishmaniasis vaccine prospectively represents the most cost-effective and successful measure to control the leishmaniases worldwide. 3 Immunity to the intracellular parasite Leishmania is associated with T-cell-mediated immune responses. 4 DNA vaccines are particularly able to deliver antigens into the major histocompatibility complex class I processing pathway, thereby inducing CD8 cytotoxic T-cell immune responses, 5, 6 necessary for clearance of Leishmania. In addition, CD4 T cells and B cells are activated by DNA vaccines. Hence, this vaccination technology is a promising approach for developing a leishmaniasis vaccine. 7 An appropriate preclinical safety profile of a vaccine candidate has to be established prior to initiation of clinical phase 1 studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization recommend the evaluation of distribution and persistence of DNA vaccines as well as their local reactogenicity and systemic toxicity. 8, 9 Results of corresponding studies suggest that DNA vaccines are safe, 10, 11 which has been confirmed in several clinical trials. 12 However, immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was often modest in humans, necessitating better delivery methods and improved vaccine antigen expression. 12 In addition, safety concerns prompted avoidance of antibiotic resistance genes and other selection markers for plasmid propagation. 13 State-of-the-art plasmids are consequently more efficacious, safer and smaller than classical plasmids. 14 Minimalistic Immunogenically Defined Gene Expression (MIDGE) vectors represent one of the most rigorous concepts for improvement. 15 MIDGE vectors are small linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules, solely containing sequences required for their function in vivo and no bacterial plasmid backbone sequences as they have been shown to negatively impact transgene expression and immunogenicity. 16, 17 MIDGE-Th1 vectors are MIDGE vectors with a short peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) covalently attached, enhancing the immune responses to encoded antigens. 18, 19 Recently, preclinical data on biodistribution and toxicity of MIDGE and MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been published, 20, 21 indicating an excellent safety profile after a single administration.

LEISHDNAVAX is a mixture of five MIDGE-Th1 vectors each encoding a different Leishmania antigen: KMP11, CPA, CPB, P74 (elongation factor 1-alpha) or TSA. 22 Antigen selection and sequence design followed a novel rational approach. In a series of animal experiments it was demonstrated that LEISHDNAVAX is immunogenic and effective against challenge with Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of VL. 22 The vaccine is aimed to be administered to humans in both preventive and therapeutic settings.

Here, we present comprehensive preclinical safety and tolerability data for LEISHDNAVAX. A repeated-dose toxicity study in naive mice and a biodistribution and persistence study in rats were performed. Moreover, the effect of LEISHDNAVAX administration on parasite burden and standard tolerability parameters in mouse models of VL were evaluated. In all studies, potential cumulative effects of repeated dosing of LEISHDNAVAX were addressed to allow for a better risk-assessment prior to multi-dose clinical trials.

LEISHDNAVAX is systemically distributed after intradermal administration Biodistribution of the vaccine was assessed in rats after intradermal (i.d.) injection of a 120 μg dose. Total DNA was extracted from tissue samples taken 24 h post injection and MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA quantified using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Vector DNA was found in a varying number of animals per group and in all tissues except for bone marrow (Figure 1a ). The vector copy numbers per μg total DNA ranged from 4.04 × 10 3 (geometric mean, ovaries, 4/5 animals positive) to 2.55 × 10 9 (geometric mean, skin of injection site, all animals positive).

Comparable distribution pattern after single or repeated administration Next, we tested whether repeated administration alters the distribution pattern or causes accumulation of vector DNA in tissues. One hundred and twenty micrograms of LEISHDNAVAX were administered to rats i.d. at the same site four times at weekly intervals. Vector DNA was quantified in total DNA extracted from tissue samples collected 24 h after the last injection. Distribution patterns and amounts of vector DNA were comparable 24 h after single and repeated injection (Figures 1a and b) . Copy numbers per μg total DNA ranged from 4.63 × 10 3 (geometric mean, lung tissue, 5/10 animals positive) to 4.50 × 10 7 (geometric mean, skin of injection site, all animals positive).

MIDGE-Th1 vectors persist at injection site and in draining lymph nodes Persistence of MIDGE-Th1 vectors was examined 14 days and 60 days post treatment. Fourteen days after four injections LEISHDNAVAX was cleared from the majority of organs (Figure 1c ). High vector copy numbers per μg total DNA were found in skin of injection site (all animals positive, geometric mean: 3.45 × 10 6 copies) and in inguinal lymph nodes (7/10 animals positive, geometric mean: 2.88 × 10 4 copies). Sixty days after four injections, MIDGE-Th1 vectors were cleared from most tissues but persisted in inguinal lymph nodes (5/10 animals positive, geometric mean: 1.44 × 10 4 copies) and skin of injection site (all animals positive, geometric mean: 6.93 × 10 5 copies) (Figure 1d ). 

To assess toxicity of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice, sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, placebo) and ascending doses of the vaccine were injected either once or five times in weekly intervals (Table 1) . LEISHDNAVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested. No animal died during the in-life phase, and no change in behavior or external appearance of the animals was noted. Comparing placebo-treated to LEISHDNAVAX-treated animals, no differences were observed in body weight, food and drinking water consumption, ophthalmological and auditory examinations, urinalysis, organ weights and the neurological screening. No local intolerance reactions were noted after single or repeated vaccine dosing. Minor deviations in single animals/groups for few blood parameters (large unstained cells, albumin/globulin ratio, αamylase) were classified as not vaccine-related. Macroscopic post mortem examination of organs revealed an enlarged spleen in a single male animal 1 day after single administration of 100 μg LEISHDNAVAX, which possibly indicated the activation of the lymphatic system. In all animals the histological findings were within the normal range of variation. No LEISHDNAVAX-related morphological lesions were found. No signs of auto-immune reactions were observed, and there were no elevated levels of serum antibodies against dsDNA detected.

Biological activity of the vaccine lot was proven by induction of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in mice of satellite groups (Table 1) . A dose-dependent increase of LEISHDNAVAXspecific IgG levels was observed (Figure 2 ), in line with data from efficacy studies as previously reported. 22 Rats receiving the vaccine during the biodistribution study did not exhibit any vaccine-related local or systemic signs of toxicity, and also necropsy did not reveal any vaccine-related toxicity.

LEISHDNAVAX is well tolerated in L. donovani-infected mice Tolerability of LEISHDNAVAX and effects on visceral parasite burden were evaluated in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Groups of mice infected with L. donovani were injected with one, two or three doses of 100 μg LEISHDNAVAX or PBS in weekly intervals. Parasite burden was evaluated seven days and 29 days after the last injection. No significant difference in hepatic or splenic parasite burden was found between groups receiving equal numbers of injections of PBS or LEISHDNAVAX. In both treatment groups infection with L. donovani followed the known kinetic 23 with distinct organ-specific growth patterns in livers and spleens of infected mice. Figure 3 shows the parasite burden as determined in the BALB/c and one C57BL/6 experiment.

No significant difference in weights between PBS and LEISHDNAVAX-treated groups of mice was observed. Serum samples from mice, which had received three injections of PBS or LEISHDNAVAX, were subjected to analyses of standard biochemical parameters; alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea and creatinine. No significant differences between PBS and LEISHDNAVAX-treated groups were found for these parameters in BALB/c mice. Significant differences were found in levels of creatinine in C57BL/6 mice in two separate experiments. However, neither the time point nor the direction of difference were consistent between experiments ( Table 2) . Histological analysis of livers and spleens in repeated experiments and the kidney, heart and lung in a single experiment (C57BL/6 mice) revealed similar lesions in all animals (PBS and LEISHDNAVAX treated) in terms of location and severity. Lesions were consistent with infection and included severe granulomatous hepatitis and splenitis with intralesional parasites, granulomatous/interstitial pneumonia and interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis.

Biodistribution and persistence of DNA vaccines are studied to estimate the duration of antigen expression and the risk of vector integration into host genomic DNA. 8, 9 We examined the biodistribution of LEISHDNAVAX after a single and, in contrast to previously published results, 20,21 also after a series of four injections at weekly intervals. This condensed application scheme is relevant for clinical approaches with: (i) a limited number of injections over a longer period of time as accepted for prophylactic vaccinations and (ii) vaccination regimes requiring more injections in shorter intervals, for example, therapeutic vaccinations. In line with recommendations of the US FDA, 8 organ and tissue samples were taken at several time points following injections and vector DNA was quantified using quantitative PCR.

Twenty-four hour after single or repeated injection, MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA was detected in almost all organs and tissues examined, suggesting that it was distributed systemically, most likely via the lymphatic system and the blood stream. A similar distribution pattern has been described for MIDGE-Th1 vectors Per day of sampling, five male and five female animals per group were killed. b Satellite group to assess biologic activity of the vaccine lot and induction of antibodies against dsDNA. Figure 2 . Immunogenicity of ascending LEISHDNAVAX doses in mice. Groups of 10 BALB/c mice (5 male, 5 female) were immunized i.d. at the tail base five times in weekly intervals with either PBS or LEISHDNAVAX (10, 50 or 100 μg per dose). Fourteen days after the last immunization LEISHDNAVAX-specific antibodies (total IgG) in sera were quantified by ELISA using plates coated with a mixture of recombinant LEISHDNAVAX antigens. ***P ⩽ 0.001 (Student's t-test); n.s.: not significant.

encoding Hepatitis B surface antigen, 21 indicating that distribution of MIDGE-Th1 vectors is independent of the encoded protein as previously reported for plasmid DNA vectors. 11 Systemic distribution at early time points has also been shown for naked plasmid DNA upon i.m. and i.d administration. 24, 25 In accordance with other reports, 11, 26, 27 the highest vector amounts were detected in samples taken from the site of injection. Consistently, lymph nodes draining the site of injection contained the second highest copy numbers, probably due to skin immune cells taking up DNA at the site of injection and migrating to the lymph nodes.

At day 14 after the fourth injection, vectors were cleared from nearly all organs except from skin and inguinal lymph nodes. Whereas the amount of vector DNA in skin samples was~10-fold lower compared with 24 h after the last injection, vector copy numbers in inguinal lymph node samples were reduced 100-fold. This finding is in line with reports on i.d.-administered plasmid DNA vaccines, [27] [28] [29] suggesting that plasmids and MIDGE-Th1 vectors ( 21 and this report) follow a similar pattern of distribution and persistence.

MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA was not cleared from skin and inguinal lymph nodes within 60 days after four injections. Although this 20 This short time to overall clearance was probably related to wider dispersion of DNA upon multiple jet injection, the lower DNA concentration (five jet injections of 10 μg DNA at 1 mg ml − 1 versus one needle injection of 120 μg DNA at 4 mg ml − 1 ), as well as the rapid entry into the blood circuit due to the high vascularization and low retention rate of macromolecules in tumor tissue as compared with normal skin tissue. Though only a side-by-side comparison would be conclusive, we propose that these parameters strongly affected the time to overall clearance than the DNA dose. In fact, the rats in our study received up to 0.6 μg LEISHDNAVAX DNA per gram body weight, thus a lower relative DNA dose than that administered to mice of the referenced study (~1.6 μg tumor necrosis factor alpha MIDGE DNA per gram body weight). 20 A persistence of at least 60 days as observed in our study suggests that vector DNA had entered long-living cells residing in the skin. Whether or not this vector DNA is still functioning cannot be concluded from our results, as the quantitative PCR method targeted a short consensus sequence only.

Notably, MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA did not accumulate in any tissue after repeated injections. At 60 days after one injection 21 or after four injections of LEISHDNAVAX, comparable amounts of MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA were found, indicating that repeated injections do not enhance persistence. Therefore, future evaluations of biodistribution and persistence of MIDGE-Th1 vectors in similar settings can be based on a single injection.

Long-term persistence of vector DNA in tissues can be related to integration into host genomic DNA and thus, theoretically bears tumorigenic potential. However, published data show that the integration rate of plasmid DNA vectors does not exceed the rate of spontaneous mutation events within the host genome. 26, 27, 30 Notably, for linear DNA vectors with a structure similar to MIDGE vectors a very low level of integration has been described. 31 Furthermore and in contrast to closed circular plasmid DNA molecules, integration of covalently closed linear DNA constructs rather leads to disruption of chromosomes followed by apoptosis of affected cells, hence minimizing the risk of replicating unwanted genetic rearrangements. 32 On the basis of these published results, the risk related to potential integration of MIDGE-Th1 vectors into host genomic DNA can be considered as low, though it was not assessed in this work.

In a repeated-dose toxicity study in naive mice, we tested three ascending doses of LEISHDNAVAX. The highest dose of 100 μg corresponds to a human dose of~300 mg DNA on a mg kg − 1 body weight base. Doses in published clinical trials ranged from 0.1 mg 33 to 4 mg 34 of plasmid DNA, so our study design includes a high safety margin. To further extend the safety margin, the vaccine was administered in a condensed schedule of five vaccinations (one more than the estimated maximum number for clinical application) in weekly intervals. Importantly, a No Observed Adverse Effect Level, that is, the highest dose without significant toxicity, was not reached with the doses tested. No local intolerance reactions related to the vaccine were observed. The results established in naive mice are corroborated by safety data obtained from the biodistribution study. Rats received 120 μg LEISHDNAVAX, corresponding to a human dose of~24 mg (based on mg kg − 1 body weight). There were no vaccine-related toxic effects observed either. Our results further confirm the findings of other investigators reporting excellent preclinical safety profiles of DNA vectors. 10, 11, 20, 26, 27, 30 In Leishmania-infected and diseased individuals, tolerability of the vaccine may be different than in healthy, naive vaccinees. Moreover, owing to the ability of Leishmania amastigotes to exploit host IgG as virulence factor, 35 there is the theoretical risk of vaccine-related immune-enhancement of infection and pathogenesis as discussed for other infectious diseases. 36, 37 Hence demonstration of absence of disease exacerbation was included into the development program of LEISHDNAVAX. We evaluated the tolerability of LEISHDNAVAX in two different mouse strains, chosen for their inherent differences in cytokine responses to infection with L. donovani. 38 These experiments demonstrate that LEISHDNAVAX had no effect on the kinetics of the parasite burden with no vaccine-related enhancement of infection at any of the time points investigated. The kinetic of infection corresponded to the well-documented pattern in mice with a rapid increase in hepatic parasite burden, followed by a decline in parasite numbers and clearance and a slower increase in parasite numbers in the spleen with the establishment of chronic infections. 23 Results for all other standard parameters were similar for treated and nontreated mice, demonstrating a good tolerability of the vaccine candidate in infected animals.

In summary, we have shown here that LEISHDNAVAX, a novel DNA vaccine candidate against leishmaniasis is safe and well tolerated in both naive and Leishmania-infected mice. After repeated i.d. injections, the vaccine was rapidly cleared from most organs and tissues of rats and persisted in the skin of injection site and its draining lymph nodes only. We conclude that LEISHDNAVAX has a favorable safety profile that supports the initiation of human clinical trials.

LEISHDNAVAX is an equimass mixture of five MIDGE-Th1 vectors, dissolved in sterile PBS. Each vector encodes one Leishmania antigen: KMP11, CPA, CPB, P74 or TSA, respectively. Their DNA sequences and expression cassettes of MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been described previously. 22 MIDGE-Th1 vectors were synthesized in a simple and standardized procedure. 18 Forty Wistar rats (20 per sex, Janvier Labs, Saint-Berthevin, France), 8 weeks of age, were allocated to single-or four-dose study groups with 10 animals each (five per sex). Animals received needle injections of 120 μg LEISHDNAVAX per injection (~5.3 × 10 13 MIDGE-Th1 vector molecules, injection volume 30 μl) i.d. at the dorsal base of tail, either once or four times in weekly intervals. Animals injected with a single dose were killed 24 h after administration. Four-dose groups were either killed 24 h, 14 days or 60 days after the fourth injection. Clinical signs were recorded before, 30 min and 4 h after treatment, thereafter once daily. Twenty-four hours after injection, a modified Irwin test 39 was performed on the single-dose group and on a non-treated control group to assess acute neurological toxicity of the vaccine. Throughout the study, mortality was evaluated once daily and body weight once weekly. At killing, animals were anesthetized deeply by isoflurane inhalation and blood was collected from the plexus ophthalmicus. Gross pathology was performed and samples of the following tissues were taken: blood, thigh bone marrow, brain, heart, kidneys, liver (Lobus quadratus), lymph nodes (Lnn. axillares, inguinales, mesenteriales), lung, thigh muscle, ovaries, skin of injection site, spleen and testes. To avoid cross-contamination with vector DNA single-use scalpels were applied for each sample. All other equipment was thoroughly decontaminated after each dissection. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80°C until processing.

Quantitative analyses of DNA vector amounts were performed at IMGM Laboratories (Martinsried, Germany). Total DNA was extracted from Safety and tolerability of a leishmaniasis DNA vaccine O Riede et al ~20 mg tissue or up to 280 μl blood, respectively, using the DNeasy Blood&Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored at − 20°C. A TaqMan-based quantitative realtime-PCR assay was established and characterized using a standard curve of LEISHDNAVAX ranging from 10 vector copies per reaction to 1.05 × 10 11 vector copies per reaction with 200 ng genomic DNA from the livers of naive animals as background.

Measurements were carried out with 200 ng of extracted total DNA in 384 well plates with a reaction volume of 20 μl on an AB7900HT instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) and hydrolysis MGB probe (Life Technologies) were designed to detect a consensus sequence present on each MIDGE-Th1 vector. The forward primer (5′-GTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATCA-3′) anneals to the CMV promoter region, the hydrolysis MGB probe (5′-FAM-TTTATTGCGGTAGTTTATCA-NFQ-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCACG ACTGCGTTAGCAATTTAA-3′) anneal to the intron. Limit of detection and lower limit of quantification of the assay were determined at 525 copies of MIDGE-Th1 vector per reaction (that is, 2625 copies per μg total DNA). All samples of extracted DNA were measured in triplicates. MIDGE-Th1 vector copy numbers were calculated according to the LEISHDNAVAX standard curve running in parallel on each plate and expressed as copy number per μg total DNA. Acceptability criteria of measurements included standard curve coefficient of correlation ⩾ 0.95 and detected copy numbers of No-template-controls below the limit of detection. In addition, the s.d. of the quantification cycle values of at least two replicate measurements had to be below 0.5, otherwise the measurement was repeated.

Assessment of vaccine toxicity. The study was performed in accordance with GLP Regulations principles and German animal welfare regulations at LPT Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hamburg, Germany with prior approval by LPT's institutional animal care and use commissary (study no. 26814) and by the competent authority (Behörde für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Amt für Verbraucherschutz Lebensmittelsicherheit und Veterinärwesen, Billstraße 80, 20539 Hamburg, Germany, V 11307-591-00.33). One hundred and forty BALB/c mice (70 male, 70 female) were randomized and allocated to study groups. Animals were housed individually. At first treatment mice were 44-49 days (males) or 60-65 days (females) of age with a body weight of 18.2-22.5 g (males) or 18.0-20.4 g (females). Ten animals each (five per sex) received one i.d. needle injection (volume: 25 μl) into the dorsal tail base with a dose of 10, 50 or 100 μg LEISHDNAVAX or the placebo (PBS). They were killed 24 h post injection for evaluation of acute toxic reactions. Thirty animals each receiving placebo and 100 μg dose, or 20 animals each receiving 10 μg and 50 μg dose (injection volume: 25 μl) were injected by needle i.d. into the dorsal tail base five times in weekly intervals. Animals were killed after a recovery period of 24 h, 14 days or 61 days (placebo and 100 μg dose group only) following the fifth injection (Table 1) .

Animals were observed for clinical signs including injection site reactogenicity before and 30 min and 4 h after each dosing and daily between injections. Mortality was evaluated twice daily throughout the study. Body weight of animals was recorded at day of group allocation, on the day of first dosing and three times a week thereafter. Food consumption was determined weekly and water consumption was recorded daily. Neurological screening 40 and assessment of grip strength 41 was conducted on all animals 24 h after first dosing. Ophthalmological and auditory examinations were performed pre-dose, at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the recovery period.

For urinalysis, mice were placed in funnel cages in groups of five per sex and received 30 ml tap water per kg body weight by gavage. Subsequently, urine was collected for 6 h and the following parameters were measured: volume, weight, pH, specific gravity, osmolality, protein, glucose, bilirubin, urobilinogen, ketones, hemoglobin, nitrite, epithelial cells, leukocytes, erythrocytes, organisms, further constituents, crystalluria.

At killing, blood was taken for clinical biochemistry (albumin, globulin, bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, glucose, protein, urea, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, α-amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, glutamate-dehydrogenase, γ-glutamyl-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase) and hematology (hemoglobin content, erythrocytes, leukocytes, differential blood count, reticulocytes, platelets, mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration).

Gross pathological examination was conducted, organ weights were taken and samples of the following organs and tissues processed for histological examination: adrenal gland, aorta abdominalis, bone (os femoris with joint), bone marrow, brain, cecum, coagulating gland with seminal vesicle, epididymis, eye with optical nerve and Harderian gland, exorbital lacrimal gland, gall bladder, heart, skin and subcutaneous tissue of injection site, large intestine, small intestine, kidney and ureter, liver, lung, lymph nodes (mandibular, mesenteric), mammary gland, muscle, sciatic nerve, esophagus, ovary, pancreas, pituitary gland, prostate, salivary glands, spinal cord, spleen, sternum, stomach, testicle, thymus, thyroid, tongue, trachea, urinary bladder, uterus and vagina.

Histological examination was performed on samples of all animals with the highest expected burden, that is, after receiving five injections of each 100 μg LEISHDNAVAX and 24 h of recovery, and the respective placebo group as control. Moreover, the immunologically relevant organs thymus, spleen and lymph nodes as well as the skin at the injection site of all animals of all groups were examined histologically. In general, tissue samples were fixed in 7% buffered formalin (eyes in Davidson´s solution), embedded in paraffin, sections prepared and routinely stained with haematoxylin-eosin.

Samples from mice receiving five times a dose of 10 or 50 μg, respectively, were scheduled for histologically examination only in case of vaccine-related findings in the group receiving five times 100 μg, or if gross pathology revealed vaccine-related changes. As there were no respective findings, these samples were not histologically examined.

Biologic activity of the vaccine lot and assessment of antibodies against dsDNA. In all, 100 BALB/c mice (50 male, 50 female) were randomized and allocated to satellite study groups of the toxicity study resembling the repeated-dose treatment schedule (Table 1) . At first treatment, animals were 44-49 days (males) or 60-65 days (females) of age with a body weight of 17-19.3 g (males) or 17-18.4 (females) . At study termination, blood samples were taken and serum obtained for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test for antibodies against vaccine antigens and for radioimmunoassay to test for antibodies against dsDNA. These analyses were performed under non-GLP Regulations conditions. LEISHDNAVAX-specific antibodies were detected performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described 22 with minor modifications. Plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated per well with 100 μl of 5 μg ml − 1 antigen-mix (KMP11, CPA, CPB, P74, TSA 1:1:1:1:1) in PBS (Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK). Recombinant proteins were obtained from Proteogenix, Oberhausbergen, France (CPA, CPB, P74, TSA) or were kindly provided by Professor C Jaffe (KMP11). Antigen mix was assembled at LPT. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C, then washed three times with wash buffer (0.05% (v/v) TWEEN in PBS) and subsequently blocked with assay diluent (5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, USA) in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer and 100 μl per well of 1:50 diluted serum samples were added. The plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently washed five times with wash buffer. Hundred micolitre per well of anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Conc.: 11.3 mg ml − 1 ), (Sigma Aldrich) were added at a 1:5000 dilution and plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing five times developer solution containing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma Aldrich) was added and the reaction stopped by adding acid solution when the color developed. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

To assess the induction of an immune response against dsDNA a radioimmunoassay was performed at IBL International GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) using a kit for detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies (IBL International). In brief, 25 μl of serum sample was mixed with 150 μl of 125 I-labeled dsDNA tracer and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Subsequently, 1 ml of cold ammonium sulfate solution was added to the sample followed by vortexing. Tubes were centrifuged (15 min at 1500 g) and supernatant was removed. Radioactivity was counted using a gamma counter and the dsDNA binding capacity was calculated according to a standard curve. under specific pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated cages and exposed to 12 h light-12 h dark cycles. Standard rodent diet (RM No 1 Expanded) and de-ionized water were supplied ad libitum. L. donovani (strain MHOM/ET/67/HU3) was maintained in Rag-1 (B6) KO mice and amastigotes harvested from spleens of infected animals 440 days after infection.

Infection and treatment schedule. Female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks of age at the start of experiments) were infected by injecting 2 × 10 7 freshly harvested L. donovani amastigotes intravenously into a tail vein as described. 42 Following infection, animals were sorted into groups of three to five mice per cage and two cages assigned to each treatment group. Groups of mice received either one, two or three injections of LEISHDNAVAX containing 20 μg DNA/antigen (corresponding to 100 μg total DNA) or PBS, administered in volumes of 25 μl i.d. at the base of the tail using 29G single-use needles (BD Microfine Plus Insulin Syringes). The first dose was administered 7 days after infection and repeat doses in 7-day intervals. Groups of mice were killed 7 days after having received the last dose of LEISHDNAVAX or PBS. In a further experiment in C57BL/6 mice additional groups were killed 29 days after the last of a total of three doses of LEISHDNAVAX or PBS.

Determination of efficacy and tolerability parameters. Mouse weights were recorded prior to the first dose of treatments administered and in weekly intervals thereafter. The injection site was monitored following administration of treatments and animals were observed daily by trained staff for the whole duration of the experiments. Mice were humanely killed by exsanguination under terminal anesthesia and blood collected by cardiac puncture. Livers and spleens were removed and their weight recorded. Tissue impression smears were prepared, fixed in 100% methanol and stained in 10% Giemsa. Parasite burden was determined microscopically and Leishman-Donovan Units calculated by the formula number of parasites per host cell nucleus × organ weight in mg, as described previously. 43 Serum was harvested from blood stored overnight at 4°C by centrifugation at 1500 g, 4°C for 15 min and stored at − 80°C. Biochemical analysis of standard serum parameters was carried out by LABOKLIN GmbH&Co.KG (Bad Kissingen, Germany). For histology, organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological data were evaluated in blinded fashion.

Data from the repeated-dose toxicity study in naive mice were analyzed using Student's t-test for numerical functional tests (P ⩽ 0.01), Dunnet's multiple t-test for body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry and organ weights (P ⩽ 0.01) and Fisher's exact test for histology (P ⩽ 0.05), respectively.

Toxicity data of the biodistribution study were evaluated as follows: parameters of the Irwin test were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U-test (P ⩽ 0.05) and normality of body weight data by Shapiro-Wilks test. In case of normality, an analysis of variance was performed with post hoc Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons; otherwise, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunnett's test was employed (P ⩽ 0.05).

IgG levels were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, USA). Normality of data was tested with Shapiro-Wilk test prior to applying either two-tailed Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test to analyze differences between means of two groups (P ⩽ 0.05).

To evaluate tolerability of the vaccine in infected mice, comparisons between three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison's test with comparison between PBS and vaccine treated groups. Comparisons between two groups were made by an unpaired t-test assuming Gaussian distribution (GraphPad Prism 6). A P-value of o0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Development of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies for prevention and therapy of MERS-CoV infections,"The recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak poses a serious threat to public health. Here, we summarize recent advances in identifying human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, describe their mechanisms of action, and analyze their potential for treatment of MERS-CoV infections.","In September 2012, a novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from a Saudi Arabian patient suffering with a SARS-like disease characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. The patient later died of respiratory and renal failure [1] . Most people diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection have developed severe acute respiratory illness. As of November 7, 2014, 909 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to the World Health Organization, including at least 331 related deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07november-2014-mers). The outbreak of MERS-CoV poses a serious threat to global public health and highlights an urgent need for the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to treat and prevent MERS-CoV infection [2, 3] .

Therapeutic modalities based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown clinical success in the treatment of many diseases [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The therapeutic potential of antibodies targeting coronaviruses was well recognized during the SARS outbreak [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In this review, we summarize the recent progress in identifying human neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV, describe their mechanisms of action, and analyze their potential for the therapy and prophylaxis of MERS. We also discuss future directions towards developing a strategy for the rapid development of antibody-based antivirals to combat emerging viruses and diseases in an outbreak setting.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that typically infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals. Based on observation under electron microscopy, they are named for solar corona-like surface projections created by viral spike (S) glycoproteins. The first two coronaviruses infecting human, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were identified in the 1960s from the nasal cavities of patients presenting with the common cold [15] [16] [17] . They were found to cause only mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses [18, 19] ; as a result, coronaviruses were considered relatively harmless to humans. However, during the winter of 2002-2003, clinicians recognized a new, deadly coronavirus strain able to infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [20, 21] . This coronavirus, subsequently named SARS-CoV, rapidly spread around the world and caused a worldwide outbreak with 8 23] . These coronaviruses, like HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, are only common cold viruses which circulate worldwide and generally cause relatively mild respiratory symptoms [22] [23] [24] . However, the threat of coronaviruses has not disappeared. In 2012, a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was identified, and its human infection results in a higher mortality rate (~36%) than that of SARS-CoV (~10%) [1] . Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can cause atypical pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and, potentially, renal failure in infected individuals [25] . MERS-CoV cases have been reported in more than twenty countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and it has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact [2, 3] .

Despite sharing several clinical and epidemiological features in common with SARS-CoV, the two coronaviruses can still be distinguished. MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus, while SARS-CoV is a lineage B betacoronavirus [1] . MERS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct from any human coronavirus, including SARS-CoV, but it is more related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 [26, 27] . Importantly, MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also named CD26) as the receptor on the surface of human cells, while SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cellular receptor [28] . The differences in receptor binding by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may be a reflection of their ability and preference to infect cells. DPP4 is widely expressed on nonciliated bronchial epithelium and the epithelial cells in kidney, small intestine, liver, parotid gland, and even testis and prostate [2] . Its wide distribution may explain the diversity of clinical manifestations in MERS-CoV infections.

The emergence of novel coronavirus MERS-CoV, which comes only a decade after the appearance of the first highly pathogenic coronavirus, SARS-CoV, suggests that coronaviruses may represent a continuous and long-term threat to human health. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are believed to have originated from bats [29, 30] . Since MERS-CoV-specific antibodies and RNA fragments have been detected in camels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Kenya, dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa are considered to be an intermediate transmitter of MERS-CoV from bats to humans [31] [32] [33] [34] . Importantly, Yang et al. recently examined the cross-species transmissibility of bat coronavirus HKU4, which is genetically related to MERS-CoV, and found that HKU4 also uses DPP4 as the cellular receptor, but prefers bat DPP4 over human DPP4, while MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 [35] . These results suggest that MERS-CoV has adapted to human DPP4 to gain entry into host cells. Since bats are the natural host for a wide range of coronaviruses, the risks posed by the cross-species transmission of these zoonotic coronaviruses for human infections must never be underestimated.

Although the emergence of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV highlights an urgent need for potent therapeutic and prophylactic agents, no approved antiviral treatments for any human coronavirus infections are currently available. Recently, tremendous efforts have been made in the search for an effective anti-MERS-CoV agent, and a number of antiviral agents have been identified. For example, some compounds with inhibitory activities in the low micromolar range on MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures have been identified from the libraries of FDA-approved drugs [36, 37] . Falzarano et al. also reported that rhesus macaques treated with a cocktail of IFN-α2b with ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, exhibited reduced MERS-CoV replication and an improved clinical outcome [38] . Interestingly, Lu et al. also found that HR2P, a synthesized peptide derived from the HR2 domain of MERS-CoV spike protein, could specifically bind to the HR1 domain of the viral spike protein and block viral fusion core formation, resulting in the inhibition of MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion [39] . HR2P is being optimized to further improve its inhibitory activity, and these HR2P analogues have the potential to be further developed as effective viral fusion inhibitors for treatment of MERS-CoV.

MAbs are enjoying significant clinical success, and they have been used for the effective treatment of a number of diseases, in particular, cancer and immune disorders [4] [5] [6] . Although Synagis (palivizumab), a humanized mAb against respiratory syncytial virus, is still the only mAb approved by the FDA for clinical use against a viral disease [40] , a number of antiviral mAbs have been developed in recent years, and some are now in clinical development [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Recently, for example, a human mAb, m102.4 [41] , made history by being the first mAb administered on a compassionate basis to humans exposed to Hendra virus based on its efficacy in vitro and in vivo [42, 43] . More recently, ZMapp, a cocktail of three mAbs, which showed promising results when administered to rhesus monkeys infected with Ebola virus [46] , has been administered to several Ebola patients. Broadly protective antibodies against HIV-1, or influenza A viruses, are also being tested in clinical trials [44, 45] .

During the SARS outbreak, neutralizing antibodies were detected in SARS patients, as well as animals infected with the virus [47] [48] [49] . The antibodies also protected uninfected animals from SARS-CoV infection. Specifically, passive transfer of immune serum to naïve mice prevented virus replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal virus challenge [50] . Thus, a vast effort has been devoted to developing mAbs that can neutralize the virus and have the potential for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV infection [9-11, 13, 14] . The generation and mechanism of neutralization of these mAbs have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [8] . In general, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV can be isolated from the memory B-cell repertoire of patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV infection, generated from transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, or identified from non-immune human antibody libraries constructed from the B lymphocytes of healthy donors. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies of these human mAbs have been demonstrated in mice or ferret models of SARS-CoV infection [10, 13, 14] . Most of the neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, suggesting a possible mechanism of neutralization by preventing virus attachment to its receptor. Some antibodies recognize epitopes on the S2 domain of S glycoprotein, suggesting that other mechanisms could also be involved in the inhibition of SARS-CoV infection, including steric hindrance that indirectly prevents virus attachment, or antibody Fc-mediated effector functions, for example, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Since the SARS epidemic was contained in July 2003, the clinical development of the above-mentioned antibodies targeting SARS-CoV has not been pursued. Fortunately, a wealth of knowledge has been accumulated through the experience of managing the SARS outbreak, and the therapeutic potential of coronavirus-targeting antibodies has been well recognized. When the novel coronavirus MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, this body of knowledge allowed the development of an effective response to the threat of MERS at an unprecedented pace.

First, it has been found that the RBD of MERS-CoV S1 glycoprotein is capable of inducing significant neutralizing antibody responses in mice [51] [52] [53] . Thus, neutralizing mouse mAbs could be developed to block MERS-CoV entry into human cells. For example, Du et al. generated some neutralizing mAbs by immunizing mice with recombinant MERS-CoV S1 fused to IgG1 Fc [53] . Anti-MERS-CoV mAbs were identified by screening positive clones from hybridoma cell lines and testing their inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry mediated by S protein, as well as neutralization against live MERS-CoV infection, in DPP4expressing Vero E6 cells. Mersmab1, the most potent anti-MERS-CoV mAb, was selected on the basis of its efficacy in blocking the entry of MERS-CoV pseudoviruses into DPP4expressing Huh-7 cells and inhibiting the formation of MERS-CoV-induced CPE during MERS-CoV infection of permissive Vero E6 cells and Calu-3 cells. Thus, mouse mAbs, such as Mersmab1, can be humanized for development as potent therapeutic and prophylactic agents against MERS-CoV infections.

In April 2014, three studies conducted by separate laboratories around the world reported the development of fully human neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV [54] [55] [56] . It is noteworthy that all these mAbs target the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 glycoprotein and that they were all identified from non-immune human antibody libraries. Specifically, among these antibodies, three highly potent mAbs (m336, m337, m338) were identified from a very large phage-displayed antibody Fab library that we recently generated by using B cells from the blood of 40 healthy donors [54] . This library was panned against recombinant MERS-CoV RBD to enrich for high affinity binders. The three identified mAbs, all derived from the VH gene 1-69, which has been the source of many other antiviral antibodies, exhibited exceptionally potent activity and neutralized pseudotyped MERS-CoV with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 Although all the above-mentioned human mAbs exhibited potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro, the evaluation of their efficacy in animal models of infection is still necessary before any of them can be further developed as therapeutic or prophylactic agents. However, unlike SARS-CoV, which can effectively infect and replicate in several cell types in human and animals, including mice and rhesus macaques, MERS-CoV cannot infect small laboratory animals, e.g., mice, hamsters or ferrets, while only causing mild to moderate symptoms in rhesus macaques, thus effectively stalling further research efforts [57] [58] [59] . Variations in DPP4 among animal species are considered to determine susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection [59] . Thus, Zhao et al. developed a mouse model for MERS by using an adenovirus expressing the human DPP4 to sensitize mice for infection [60] . With prior transduction of adenoviral human DPP4-expressing vectors, mice became more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. This method could be used for rapid evaluation of an anti-MERS vaccine and an antiviral therapy. However, whether the infected mice treated by this inhaled-adenovirus method underwent the same disease progression and immune response as typically observed in human remains unknown. A better model could be a transgenic mouse model with the human DPP4 gene integrated into the genome. Recently, Falzarano et al. found that MERS-CoV infection in marmosets closely mimics the severe pneumonia experienced by people infected with MERS-CoV [59] . Most of the animals infected with MERS-CoV developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident, and high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all marmosets. Marmoset DPP4 has an amino acid sequence identical to that of human DPP4 in the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein binding region, resulting in the observed susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. These results suggest that the marmoset model is an important advance in the ability to assess the efficacy of intervention strategies against MERS, in turn allowing the preclinical evaluation of neutralizing mAbs for treatment of MERS-CoV infection.

To realize the preventive or therapeutic potential of neutralizing mAbs in the clinical setting, it is also necessary to investigate the mechanisms by which the antibodies modulate the biological behaviors of MERS-CoV. In order to explore the mechanism of action of human mAbs m336, m337, and m338, we first defined the MERS-CoV epitopes recognized by these mAbs [54] . The binding of mAbs to fragments of the S glycoprotein was measured, and, as expected, the mAbs only bound to the S fragments containing the RBD, specifically residues 377 to 588. We further analyzed the mAbs binding to a series of alanine mutants of the RBD and found that the three mAbs had overlapping, but distinct, binding sites. For example, residues 510 and 553 were important for binding of all three mAbs. Residues 536 and 539, on the other hand, were uniquely bound by m336, which turned out to be the most potent neutralizer among the three mAbs, suggesting that these residues may be crucial for m336 interaction and, hence, important for vaccine development. We next found that the three mAbs competed with each other for binding the MERS-CoV RBD and also competed with RBD for binding to a soluble version of DPP4. Consistent with the neutralization results, m336 was slightly more potent than m337 and m338 in blocking the binding of RBD to DPP4. The IC 50s of m336, m337, and m338 were 0.034, 0.044, and 0.041 μg/ml, respectively, values which were in a range similar to the neutralizing activity of the mAbs against pseudotyped MERS-CoV in DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (0.005 to 0.017 μg/ml). These results support the idea that the mAbs have overlapping epitopes and neutralize MERS-CoV by competing with the receptor binding. Using the mutagenesis data and the MERS-CoV RBD crystal structure, we generated three-dimensional molecular docking models of the mAbs interacting with the RBD [54] . Good superimposition of DPP4 with the mAbs-RBD structures confirmed that the competition with MERS-CoV for receptor binding is an important mechanism of action of the mAbs in neutralizing MERS-CoV cell entry. The extensive overlapping between the mAb epitopes and the receptor binding sites on RBD explains the exceptional neutralizing potency of these mAbs. Similarly, Jiang et al. also found that the neutralizing mAbs MERS-4 and MERS-27 could inhibit the binding of soluble RBD to DPP4-expressing Huh7 cells [55] . From the binding competition assays, Tang et al. found that 2B11 and six other mAbs could recognize at least three different epitopes on MERS-CoV RBD and that the antibodies could block DPP4 binding to MERS-CoV RBD and inhibit the attachment of pseudovirus to DPP4-expressing cells [56] . DPP4 could also block the antibodies from RBD binding. Taken together, these results suggest that the neutralizing mechanism of all the above-mentioned human mAbs, despite recognizing different epitopes on RBD, occurred through the blocking of MERS-CoV binding to its cellular receptor DPP4. Interestingly, Jiang et al. also demonstrated that the combination of MERS-4 and MERS-27, which were found to recognize different epitopes on RBD, resulted in a synergistic neutralizing effect against pseudotyped MERS-CoV [55] .

Emerging viruses, e.g. SARS-like or MERS-like novel coronaviruses, are highly likely to continue posing a serious threat to human health in the near future. In this context, it is prudent to develop strategies to provide a quick response. Polyclonal human immunoglobulin has been used with various degrees of success for viral diseases for more than a century, and some are still in clinical use against, for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, rabies, measles and vaccinia [7] . However, a number of toxicity-related problems have arisen, including a risk for allergic reactions, pathogen transmission, and lotto-lot variation. In addition, only a very small portion of the total antibodies in a polyclonal preparation is typically neutralizing, while the remainder is not only ineffective, but could be immunogenic, or even toxic. These limitations could be overcome by the use of human mAbs. Nevertheless, a major obstacle comes from the difficulty of generating highly potent neutralizing mAbs in a relatively short amount of time. In this review, we summarized the recent developments in human neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV which have been identified by different laboratories around the globe at an unprecedented pace. Improvement in antibody identification techniques, combined with the recent advances in antibody production technologies, highlights the potential of human mAbs for application toward a strategy designed to combat future emerging viruses and diseases in an outbreak setting.

Apart from the above limitations, the use of antiviral mAbs may produce escape mutants. Although the mutation rates in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are only moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses, the frequency of the emergence of escape mutants should not be underestimated. A promising solution may lie in the use of ""mAb cocktails"" in which two or more mAbs targeting different epitopes are mixed. Such mAb cocktails would not only provide more potent antiviral activity than a single mAb by additive and/or synergistic effects [61] , but also prevent escape variants for many viruses, including SARS-CoV [13] . Interestingly, even though all recently developed human mAbs against MERS-CoV target the RBD of S glycoprotein [54] [55] [56] , most of them recognize distinct epitopes, as discussed above. Therefore, it might be expected that the emergence of resistant viruses to these RBDspecific mAbs, if any, would exert a toll on virus fitness because the escape mutants could have lower affinity for the cellular receptor DPP4. Furthermore, Jiang et al. have demonstrated that the combination of two human mAbs, MERS-4 and MERS-27, resulted in a synergistic neutralizing effect against pseudotyped MERS-CoV [55] . Thus, it would be interesting to test if other combinations of the available mAbs would give similar, or better, synergistic effects and if so, whether these mAb cocktails could neutralize mutant viruses emerging in the future.

High production cost is a substantial obstacle for the commercial development of antiviral human mAbs, especially mAbs against emerging viruses. One strategy to reduce the overall cost is to develop exceptionally potent neutralizing mAbs, resulting in a reduction in the dose required to achieve efficacy. This could be achieved by developing human mAbs with ultra high binding affinity and then rationally designing the products to target the critical neutralization site, e.g., RBD. For example, the exceptionally potent mAb m336 can bind to the MERS-CoV RBD with picomolar affinity, and the potency for virus neutralization (IC 50 ) is also in the picomolar range, suggesting that a low dose of mAbs could be clinically effective. Furthermore, recent progress in antibody engineering enables the generation of more effective antibody-based therapeutics, e.g., bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or antibodies with improved effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [5] . Notably, antibody fragments with a reduced size (12-50 kDa) could achieve enhanced tissue penetration, as well as a wider range of possible targets, and, importantly, require much lower production costs, providing the potential to overcome the fundamental limitations of full-size mAbs [62] . However, compared to mAbs, antibody fragments, such as VH or Fab, display greatly reduced half-lives, and as such, they have limited clinical potential. We recently generated some novel IgG1 Fc-based antibody fragments, which have small size (14-27 kDa), good stability and solubility, and relatively long in vivo half-life [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . When fused to VH, the resulting novel antibody constructs can still be solubly expressed in Escherichia coli with high yields [64] . Therefore, these small, long-acting antibodies have the potential to be developed as commercially attractive prophylactic and therapeutic antivirals for a wide array of indications.

The threat of emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS and MERS, emphasizes the need for a fast and versatile approach that allows us to rapidly identify effective antivirals to combat the viruses. We have reviewed here the recent success in identifying fully human neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV. The rapid identification of these antibodies suggests the possibility of using non-immune human antibody libraries and related methodologies for a quick response to these emerging viruses with pandemic potential. All the mAbs, despite being developed by different laboratories, target the RBD of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and may have a similar mechanism of action, i.e., blocking the binding of MERS-CoV to its cellular receptor DPP4. Notably, some human mAbs have exhibited exceptionally potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro, whereas the evaluation of their efficacy in an effective animal infection model, like the marmoset MERS-CoV infection model, is yet to be performed. Most mAbs recognize different epitopes on MERS-CoV RBD, suggesting that mAb cocktails may exhibit more potent anti-MERS activity based on additive and/or synergistic effects, also helping to prevent the occurrence of viral escape mutants. We expect that recent advances in antibody engineering will foster the development of more effective and affordable therapeutic or prophylactic agents by improving effector functions, making antibody-drug conjugates, or generating small-sized and long-acting novel antibody constructs based on these human neutralizing mAbs.

Peptide-Mediated Liposomal Drug Delivery System Targeting Tumor Blood Vessels in Anticancer Therapy,"Solid tumors are known to recruit new blood vessels to support their growth. Therefore, unique molecules expressed on tumor endothelial cells can function as targets for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer. Current efforts are focusing on developing therapeutic agents capable of specifically targeting cancer cells and tumor-associated microenvironments including tumor blood vessels. These therapies hold the promise of high efficacy and low toxicity. One recognized strategy for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutics is to encapsulate anticancer drugs into targeting liposomes that bind to the cell surface receptors expressed on tumor-associated endothelial cells. These anti-angiogenic drug delivery systems could be used to target both tumor blood vessels as well as the tumor cells, themselves. This article reviews the mechanisms and advantages of various present and potential methods using peptide-conjugated liposomes to specifically destroy tumor blood vessels in anticancer therapy.","One of the primary goals of a successful cancer treatment regimen is to deliver sufficient amounts of drug to tumors while minimizing damage to normal tissues. Most chemotherapeutic agents enter normal tissues in the body with indiscriminate cytotoxicity and do not preferentially accumulate at tumor sites. At times the dose reaching the tumor may be as little as 5% to 10% of the doses accumulating in normal organs [1, 2] . One reason for the inability for drugs to accumulate at target sites is that the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in solid tumors is higher than in normal tissues, that blocking transcapillary transport of chemotherapeutic drugs or antibodies [3] [4] [5] . In this way, the anticancer effect is decreased and toxic effect to normal cells is increased. Fear of severely harming the patients often limits the dose of anticancer drugs that can be given to a patient. These lower than optimal doses elicit incomplete tumor responses which leads to disease relapse and drug resistance. Therefore, most cancer drugs fail in clinical studies not because they are ineffective in killing cancer cells but because they cannot be administered in doses high enough to eradicate the tumor without severely harming the patient.

Several approaches have been developed to improve the ability of anticancer drug to more specifically target tumors and avoid normal organs. One of the most effective strategies is to encapsulate drugs in particles that deliver them preferentially to tumor sites. For example, liposome particles have been found able to deliver radionuclides, genes, and chemotherapeutic agents to tumor sites. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Another promising strategy is to encapsulate anticancer drugs in liposomes conjugated with moieties, such as antibodies and peptides, that target particular types of target tumor cells or tumor vasculatures [11] [12] [13] . Use of internalizing ligands for targeting liposomes conjugated with such moieties makes it possible to deliver the chemotherapeutic drugs encapsulated within them to the cytosol through the receptor-mediated endocytosis [14] [15] [16] [17] . This article reviews the current research in developing liposomal drug delivery systems that use peptide ligands to target blood vessels in solid tumors. We discuss the identification of peptides that can target tumor blood vessels and the use of targeting and nontargeting 12 GGT GGA GGT TCG-3 Figure 1 : Selection of peptides that target tumor blood vessels using in vivo phage display. Peptide or antibody libraries are expressed as fusion proteins with a coat protein (pIII) of a bacteriophage, and the fused proteins are displayed on the surface of the virion. A phagedisplayed peptide library was injected through the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice. Eight minutes after injection, the mice were perfused through the heart. Phage recovered from the tumor was amplified and reinjected in mice for another four rounds. Tumor-targeting phages were further identified by in vivo tumor-homing assay, synthetic peptide binding and competition assay, and immunohistochemical staining. The identified peptides can be used as ligands to recognize cell surface markers or tumor antigens to develop targeted therapy. SCID mice bearing human cancer xenografts were successfully treated with ligand-conjugated antiangiogenic targeting liposomes.

liposomes to encapsulate and deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor sites.

Virtually every conventional cytotoxic drug has been found to be antiangiogenic in in vitro and in vivo models [18] . One treatment approach known as metronomic therapy uses frequent administrations of low-dose antiangiogenic agents to destroy vessels in tumors while decreasing the toxicity to normal tissues [19] [20] [21] . For example, it has been found in mice that frequent administration of relatively low, noncytotoxic doses of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin can shrink various solid tumor xenografts [13, 16] . The antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin), a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used with some success to treat advanced colon cancer. One study compared the effect using three chemotherapeutic agents alone to treat advanced colon cancer with using the three agents combined with bevacizumab [22] . They found that the combined use of chemotherapeutic agents and bevacizumab extended overall survival by approximately 4.7 months compared to the use of chemotherapeutic agents alone [22] . Other angiogenesis inhibitors, including sunitinib and sorafenib, have also been found to improve clinical outcomes when used to treat various cancer types [23, 24] . The targeting of proliferating endothelial cells in the blood vessels of tumors has several advantages. First, endothelial cells in malignant tumors are genetically stable, nonmalignant, and rarely drug resistant, compared to the cancer cells [19, 21] . However, some recent studies show that tumor-associated endothelial cells can acquire cytogenetic abnormalities while they are in the tumor microenvironment [25, 26] . Second, the destruction of endothelial cells using this method amplifies the drugs antitumor effect. It has been reported that the elimination of one endothelial cell can inhibit the growth of as many as a hundred tumor cells [27, 28] . Third, antiangiogenic therapy decreases IFP within the tumor allowing better penetration by chemotherapeutic agents [29] [30] [31] [32] . For example, Jain found that bevacizumab could decrease IFP by normalizing tumor vasculature and decreasing vascular leakage [29, 33] . Fourth, antiangiogenic therapy is known to inhibit the growth of both primary and metastatic solid tumors. Finally, intravenously injected angiogenesis inhibitors can directly reach endothelial cells.

In addition, we can take advantage of the differences between endothelial cell plasma membrane proteins (i.e., vascular zip codes) to develop drug delivery systems capable of guiding therapeutic or imaging agents to a particular [13, 14, 50] . The reaction was completed and confirmed by quantifying the remaining amino groups using TNBS (Trinitrobenzenesulfonate) reagent [51] . Peptidyl-PEG-DSPE was transferred to preformed liposomes after coincubation at a temperature above the transition temperature of the lipid bilayer [52] . There were 500 peptide molecules per liposome [53] . The mean diameter of the targeting liposome is approximately 75 nm [2, 13] .

organ or tumor [34, 35] . Endothelial cells of blood vessels within solid tumors express certain molecular structures that are absent or minimally detectable in normal blood vessels [13, 36, 37] . These structures can be used as molecular targets for antitumor treatment.

The key to delivering drugs specifically to these targets is to identify and use ligands that specifically bind to and that can be internalized by endothelial cells in tumors. Combinatorial peptide libraries displayed on microorganisms have become a research tool for identifying cell surface-binding peptides that can become targets for antitumor treatment. Of the many molecular display techniques, phage display has been the most popular approach. Phage display is a selection technique in which a peptide or protein is fused with a coat protein of bacteriophage and displayed on the surface of the virion. Phage-displayed random peptide libraries have helped researchers map B-cell epitopes [38] [39] [40] , discover protein-protein contacts [41, 42] , and identify bioactive peptides bound to receptors [43, 44] or proteins [45, 46] . Peptide libraries can be used to find disease-specific antigens [47, 48] and cell- [2, 49] and organ-specific peptides [16, 35, 36] .

Recently, using affinity selection (biopanning) of phagedisplayed peptide libraries, researchers have discovered molecules that are expressed on tumor blood vessels exclusively [16, [34] [35] [36] . The strategy for identifying tumortargeting ligands and developing ligand-mediated targeted therapy is shown in Figure 1 . Researchers have used in vivo affinity selection of phage libraries to identify peptides that interact with the molecules found on endothelia in tumors [34, 36] . The NGR peptide motif targets angiogenic blood vessels [36] and the tumor-homing property of NGR motif relies on recognition of a CD13 isoform selectively expressed within tumor blood vessels [54] . Compared with the nontargeting liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx), NGR peptide-conjugated Caelyx significant improvements in survival was seen in clinically relevant animal models of neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung cancers [17] . Another peptide, SP5-52, has been found to recognize blood vessels created in tumors but not normal blood vessels in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing solid tumors. Several selected phage clones display Pro-Ser-Pro, a motif crucial to peptide binding to tumor neovasculature [13] . Several tumor homing peptides have been found to bind to blood vessels in surgical specimens of human cancer and they have also been found to home to tumor tissues of different human tumor xenografts as confirmed by in vivo homing assays [16] . These studies found a greater correlation between increased tumoral accumulation of the targeting liposomes and antitumor efficacy than the accumulation of free drugs or drugs formulated in the nontargeting liposomes [2, 13, 16 ].

Most of the drug delivery systems approved for marketing are liposomal-or lipid-based formulations or therapeutic molecules linked to polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6, 10, 55, 56] . One such product is PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, Figure 3 : Diagram of the molecular mechanism of peptide-conjugated liposomes on cancer therapy. These liposomes prolong circulation time in blood and improve pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of their encapsulated drugs. After intravenous administration, liposomes are large enough to be excluded from normal endothelium. In solid tumors, the angiogenic tumor vasculature becomes leakiness that particulate liposomes can extravasate and localize in the tissue interstitial space making it possible for more drug delivering liposomes to accumulate within the tumor by EPR effect. Coupling liposomes with peptides targeted to tumor cells or tumor vasculature further enhances the specificity and accumulation of liposomes in the tumor. On arrival in the tumor tissues, the liposomes are bound and internalized by tumor cells or tumor-associated endothelial cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, fused with the low pH compartments of the endosomes, and subsequently broken down the liposomes and to release encapsulated drugs into the intracellular space of the cells.

which is known as Doxil in the US and Caelyx in Europe [57] . It is currently approved for the treatment of AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma and recurrent ovarian cancer in North America, Europe, and other countries, and for metastatic breast cancer in Europe. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin has been found to significantly improve the therapeutic index of doxorubicin both in preclinical [58] [59] [60] and in clinical studies [61] [62] [63] [64] . An important advantage of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin is that the heart muscle uptakes much less of it than free doxorubicin [58, 65] .

One study found no cardiotoxicity in 40 patients receiving cumulative doses of 500-1500 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin [62] . Free doxorubicin, on the other hand, is limited to a maximum recommended cumulative dose of 450-550 mg/m 2 . Colbern et al. found that the activity of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin 1-2 mg/kg was almost equivalent to that of free doxorubicin 9 mg/kg in mouse Lewis lung carcinoma [59] .

One clinical study reported that most (>98%) of the drug circulating in the blood stream remains in encapsulated in liposomes [61] , suggesting that little of the liposomal drugs will be leaked to the circulation system during its journey to the tumor tissues. The hyperpermeability of tumor vasculature is a key factor for the success of liposome-delivered chemotherapy agents. The ""leakiness"" of the angiogenic tumor vasculature is estimated to have an average pore size of 100-600 nm [66] . These pores are significantly larger than the gap junction found in normal endothelium, which are typically <6 nm wide [67] . Liposomes with diameters of approximately 65-75 nm [13, 14, 50] are small enough to passively infiltrate tumor endothelium but large enough to be excluded from normal endothelium. Hence, they selectively extravasate into the tumor interstitial space. In the tissue of solid tumors, vasculature becomes so permeable that particulate liposomes can extravasate and localize in the tissue interstitial space [6, 10] . In addition, tumor tissues frequently lack effective lymphatic drainage [3] , which means that the liposomes can be retained longer. Together, these factors increase the Journal of Oncology 5 accumulation of the drug within the tumor, which has been referred to as the ""enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect"" by Maeda et al. [68, 69] . EPR-mediated passive tumor targeting by liposomes can increase the concentration of drugs in solid tumors by as much as ten times, compared to free drugs [70] .

Passively targeted liposomal drug delivery systems have some disadvantages. Normal organ uptake of liposomes leads to accumulation of the encapsulated drug in mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [63] , which may present hazards to these tissues. For example, with increased circulation time of these drugs may come increased toxicity inducing such problems as handfoot syndrome, mucositis, and hematological toxicities such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia [71] [72] [73] [74] . Therefore, ongoing research aims at enhancing the tumor site-specific action of the liposomes by attaching ligands to surface molecules of tumor cells and tumor vasculature, a process called active or ligand-mediated targeting liposomes [5, 6, 13, 75] .

The disadvantage of the passive PEGylated liposomes can be overcome by creating ligand-mediated targeting liposomes with more selective anticancer activity. The activity of anticancer drugs can be enhanced by coupling targeting moieties to the surface of liposomes to promote selective binding to tumor-associated antigens and facilitate the delivery of drug-containing liposomes to the intended cellular sites. This drug delivery system has a higher drug-to-carrier ratio than immunoconjugates and multivalent presentation of ligands, which increases their binding avidity [11] .

Antibodies that bind to tumor-specific antigens have so far yielded little success as a drug delivery system for solid tumors, which make up more than 90% of all cancers in humans. Although monoclonal antibodies have shown clinical potential as tumor targeting agents, they are limited by their large molecular size and poor tumor penetration [76] , by the immunogenicity associated with immunoliposomes, and by their toxicity to liver and bone marrow from nonspecific antibody uptake. These limitations can be overcome by using peptide ligands, which are smaller, less immunogenic molecules, and easier to produce and manipulate. Furthermore, peptide ligands have moderate affinity to antigens, which is beneficial because extremely high affinity of antibody-binding can impair tumor penetration [77] . Compared with antibody ligands, peptide ligands can improve tumor penetration and decrease MPS clearance of conjugated liposomes [50, 78] . The increasing use of peptides as targeting ligands has been aided by the use of phage display to identify novel ligands (Figure 1 ). Researchers have already produced liposomes conjugated with ligands that specifically target tumor cells or tumor vasculature [5, 16, 17] .

Peptide-conjugated liposomes have three main components: anticancer drug, a liposome carrier, and targeting peptide ( Figure 2 ). Remote loading methods such as the ammonium sulfate method [13, 79] and the pH gradient method [80] can encapsulate weak bases such as doxorubicin or vinorelbine into the liposomes with more than 95% efficiency. Schedule-dependent drugs such as vinca alkaloids, topotecan, and 5-fluorouracil are also potential candidates for liposomal delivery because they can extend the time when cancer cells are exposed to therapeutic levels of the drug.

The bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of liposomeencapsulated chemotherapeutic drugs must be considered in developing these delivery systems. To take advantage of the EPR effect, liposomes need to have long half-lives so that the drug stays within the carrier as long as possible in blood circulation until it accumulates in diseased tissues [81] . Once liposomes are localized to a solid tumor, the drug they contain must be released and become bioavailable at a rate remains therapeutically effective for a period of time. The rate of active drug's release into tumor cells, not the total drug concentration in the tumor tissues, is critical for measuring the actual bioavailability of the liposomal drug [16] . Some targeting liposomes have not been found to have greater therapeutic efficacy than passive liposomal drugs, possibly because the lack of internalizing ligands does not give the drug greater access inside tumor cells [82, 83] . Drug delivery can be further enhanced if the liposome-attached ligands bind selectively to internalizing antigens which would help increase the concentration of drugs inside tumor or tumor-associated endothelial cells resulting in higher drug concentration inside the cells [13, 15, 84, 85] . This binding to internalizing antigens by ligands can induce receptor-mediated endocytosis of liposomes into endosome compartments with low pH, where the liposomes break down and release the encapsulated drug into the intracellular space ( Figure 3 ). These steps lead to higher intracellular drug concentration and greater destruction or inhibition of tumor cells. Studies have confirmed greater cytotoxic effects produced by liposomes with peptides that target internalizing antigens through enhanced specificity and improved drug bioavailability [2, 16] .

The use of drug-encapsulated liposomes with ligands to target tumor blood vessels allows us to destroy both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells. In mice bearing human cancer xenograft, low dose of peptide-conjugated liposomal doxorubicin has been found to markedly inhibit vascularization and reduce total volume and weight of tumors [13, 16, 17] . The immunofluorescent analysis of the tumors in several studies has revealed an association between significant decreases in microvessel density and increases in the apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. The severe damage to tumor vasculature caused by peptide-conjugated liposomal doxorubicin throughout the tumors suggested an improvement in chemotherapeutic efficacy over nontargeting liposomes and conventional drugs [13, 16, 17] . This dual action may produce a greater, more durable anticancer effect than is found with the use of simple antiangiogenic therapy.

One peptide-conjugated liposome can deliver over ten thousand anticancer drug molecules directly into target tumor cells efficiently and effectively. The targeted and sustained release of the drug molecules can increase the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the cytotoxic drugs 6 Journal of Oncology and dramatically lower dose-limiting toxicities, and in turn prevent treatment delay or discontinuation. The affinity of targeting ligands may allow the liposomes to move past the high IFP barrier within tumors [4, 5, 13, 16] .

Advances in nanotechnology and molecular biology are moving us closer to developing an ideal ""multifunctional smart nanodrug delivery system"" using various types of ligands and drugs based on the kinds of diagnosis, imaging, or therapy needed. Such smart nanodrug delivery systems will allow accurate, specific, and noninvasive disease treatment, early diagnosis, and monitoring. In the future, combining ligands that specifically bind to cancer cells (including cancer stem cells) and tumor blood vessels with multifunctional liposomal drug delivery systems may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment and minimize the side effects traditionally associated with chemotherapy.

The development of highly selective anticancer drugs that can discriminate between tumor cells and normal cells is the most important goal of current oncology research. The potential use of ligand-conjugated liposome-encapsulated drugs to target tumor cells and vasculature is very promising. Peptides that specifically bind to tumor targets can be coupled to the PEG terminus of sterically stabilized liposomes and subsequently precisely deliver chemotherapeutic agents to tumor cells or blood vessels. Peptide-mediated liposomes that target vasculature are a new generation of chemotherapy delivery systems with superior pharmacokinetics, controlled biodistribution, efficacy, and safety profiles.

Oral Delivery of Probiotics Expressing Dendritic Cell-Targeting Peptide Fused with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus COE Antigen: A Promising Vaccine Strategy against PEDV,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteric coronavirus, is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) that damages intestinal epithelial cells and results in severe diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. The oral vaccine route is reported as a promising approach for inducing protective immunity against PEDV invasion. Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment. In this study, in order to explore an efficient oral vaccine against PEDV infection, a mucosal DC-targeting oral vaccine was developed using Lactobacillus casei to deliver the DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) fused with the PEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen. This probiotic vaccine could efficiently elicit secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses via oral vaccination in vivo. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the immune response levels were observed between probiotics expressing the COE-DCpep fusion protein and COE antigen alone, suggesting better immune efficiency of the probiotics vaccine expressing the DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen. This mucosal DC-targeting oral vaccine delivery effectively enhances vaccine antigen delivery efficiency, providing a useful strategy to induce efficient immune responses against PEDV infection.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, causing an acute and highly contagious enteric disease in nursing pigs with up to 100% mortality, mainly results in intestinal-epithelial-cell damage [1] . Currently, an RNA vaccine and an inactivated whole-virus vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea were developed at Harrisvaccines TM and Zoetis (Florham Park, NJ, USA), respectively, widely used and considered to be effective [2] . PEDV mainly gains entry to the host via the intestinemucosal surfaces of the piglets. Therefore, it is important to develop oral mucosa vaccines that can elicit effective mucosal immune responses against PEDV infection. Nevertheless, to reach the mucosal immunity-related sites in sufficient amounts, oral mucosal vaccines need to withstand harsh digestive environments, which are proving to be a big challenge for mucosal vaccine development [3] ; therefore, effective antigen delivery vehicles and the adjuvant limit the availability of oral mucosal vaccines for stimulation of immunity [4] .

Currently, there is increasing interest in the development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-based oral vaccines against enteric viruses; this approach is crucial for the effective induction of a mucosal immune response. Lactobacillus strains have many characteristics that make them promising candidates as delivery systems for presenting compounds with antigens of interest to the mucosa, in particular vaccines [5] ; for example, Lactobacilli can survive in (and colonize) the upper gastrointestinal tract and exert an intrinsic adjuvant activity [6, 7] . Moreover, recent reports have shown that Lactobacillus species can effectively elicit production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), induce anti-inflammatory responses, activate innate cells, and regulate the balance between T cell subset responses [8, 9] . On the other hand, in order to enhance the deliver efficiency of vaccine antigens to mucosal immune tissues via oral administration, a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting mucosal vaccine was suggested as a realistic approach for oral vaccination to induce high mucosal immune responses against infection [10] . DCs, widely distributed beneath the gastrointestinal epithelium, are professional antigen-presenting cells serving as a portal for virus invasion [11] ; therefore, DCs are an early target for virus attachment.

Intestinal DC subsets regulate of the intestinalimmune homeostasis through linking humoral and cellular immune responses [12] . It was confirmed that an intestinal DC-targeting oral vaccine could elicit highly efficient antigen-specific immune responses, protecting the mucosal membrane against pathogen infection [13] . Currently, the vaccine strategy of using Lactobacillus to express DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) conjugated with Bacillus anthracis PA antigen [14] and Newcastle disease virus HN antigen has been investigated to show improved immunogenicity.

Moreover, secretory IgA (SIgA) is the predominant antibody isotype on all mucosal surfaces and prevents bacteria and viruses from infecting the intestinal mucosal barrier [15] . SIgA establishes the first line of defense on the mucosal surface to block adhesion and invasion of infectious agents [16] . Because the mucosal surface is the initial infection site for PEDV, especially in the intestinal mucosa, it would be interesting to develop oral mucosal vaccines that elicit an effective mucosal immune response against PEDV infection. The Spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV that mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion [17] harbors several neutralizing epitopes [18] , particularly the core neutralizing epitope (COE), which can induce neutralizing antibodies against PEDV [19] . The COE has been successfully expressed for vaccine purposes in plants [20] and in lactic acid bacteria [21] .

In the present study, a recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing the DC-targeting peptide conjugated with PEDV COE antigen was developed, and its immunogenicity upon administration as an oral vaccine was evaluated.

Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei 393) was cultured in our laboratory in de Man, Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) broth at 37 • C without shaking. PEDV LJB/15 strain was isolated and identified from clinical samples by our laboratory and was propagated in Vero cells at 37 • C with 5% CO 2 . The constitutive expression plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT (Figure 1Aa ), was constructed in our laboratory. 

A schematic diagram for the construction of recombinant plasmids is shown in Figure 1A . In brief, following genomic RNA extraction from PEDV propagated in Vero cells, the gene encoding the COE antigen of PEDV was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the gene encoding DCpep was then fused to 3′ terminus of the COE gene by fusion PCR. DC-targeting peptides (DCpep) that specifically bound to human DCs after screening a 12-mer peptide phage display library [7] . In this study, primer pairs F1/P1 and F1/DCpep (Table 1) were used to amplify COE gene and COE-DCpep, respectively.The gene COE and the fusion gene COE-DCpep were then cloned into the expression plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT, giving rise to recombinant plasmids pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE ( Figure 1Ab ) and pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE-DCpep (Figure 1Ac ), respectively. Details of the primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 . The recombinant plasmids pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE and pPG-T7g10-PPT-COE-DCpep were then transformed into L. casei 393 competent cells by electroporation [22] , to generate recombinant strains pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, respectively.

The bacterial strains pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, pPG-COE/L393, pPG/L393 and L. casei 393 were cultured overnight in MRS broth and harvested by centrifugation at 9000× g for 10 min at 4 • C. After cell lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot assay. The proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA), and the immunoblot was then developed using a mouse anti-COE monoclonal antibody (dilution at 1:500) prepared in our laboratory as the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (dilution at 1:3000) (Sigma, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) as the secondary antibody. The results were then visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate reagent (Thermo Scientific, Durham, NC, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Moreover, in order to further analyze whether the protein of interest was displayed on the cell surface of the recombinant strains pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and pPG-COE/L393, an immunofluorescence assay was performed according to a previously described method [24] . Briefly, the recombinant strains pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and pPG-COE/L393 were cultured overnight in MRS at 37 • C. After centrifugation at 12,000× g for 5 min, the cell pellets were incubated with mouse anti-COE monoclonal antibody (dilution at 1:100) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (diluted at 1:4000). After washing three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the nuclei were counterstained with 4 ,6 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4 • C. The pellets were washed thrice, resuspended in 1 mL PBS and smeared on a microscope slide. Fluorescence images were acquired by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

All the experimental procedures and animal management procedures were approved by the Institutional Committee of the Northeast Agricultural University for the Animal Experiments (2016NEFU-315, 13 April 2017), Harbin, China. Six-week-old female specific pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c mice (n = 60) were obtained from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Benxi, China) and kept under SPF conditions for one week with free access to a standard chow diet and water in accordance with institutional guidelines.Prior to oral administration, the recombinant strains weregrown in MRS broth at 37 • C for 12 h, and the cells were then washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 10 10 CFU/mL. The mice were orally dosed with 100 µL of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and pPG-COE/L393groups (15 mice per group). The control groups of mice (15 mice per group) were orally administered with an equivalent dose of pPG/L393 and PBS. The immunization protocol was performed on three consecutive days (days 1, 2, and 3), and a booster immunization was given on days 15, 16, and 17 ( Figure 1B ). Specimen collection was then performed at different time points post immunization ( Figure 1B ). Serum samples were collected from immunized mice on days 0, 10, 17, 27, 34, and 41 after immunization and stored at −20 • C until used. Genital tract secretions were collected on days 0, 10, 17, 27, 34, and 41 after primary immunization and stored at −40 • C until analyzed by ELISA for SIgA levels. Fecal samples were used for detecting SIgA antibody were collected and treated according to methods described previously with slight modifications [25] . In brief, 0.1 g of fecal pellets were sampled and subsequently suspended in 400 µL of PBS containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then, after incubating at 4 • C for 16 h and centrifugation at 12,000× g for 5 min, the supernatants were stored at −20 • C until used. In addition, on days 0 and 40, the intestinal mucus samples was gently scraped from the excised intestinal tissue with HEPES buffer, and clarified by centrifugation as described previously [26] .

To evaluate the potential effect of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 on DCs, murine mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) cells were collected at 36 h after orally inoculated with pPG-COE/L393, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 according to methods described previously [27] . Briefly, MLN cells were prepared using a 70 mM pore filter (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) by gentle crushing of organs. Single MLN cell suspensions were incubated with CD16/CD32 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA) to block Fc receptors (FcR). After cell suspensions were washed and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640, the cells were analyzed for DC activation by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated surface molecule CD11c, CD80, CD86 and MHC II (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Samples were examined with a FACSCalibur cytometer.

The levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the sera and SIgA antibody in the feces, genital tract secretions, and intestinal mucus samples collected from immunized mice at the indicated time points were determined by ELISA. Briefly, a polystyrene microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4 • C with PEDV propagated in Vero cells. After washing thrice with PBS-0.1% Tween 20, the plate was blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 37 • C for 2 h. After washing, the collected immune samples were added into the plate in triplicate and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. After washing, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/IgA-specific antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the plate and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. Furthermore, the expression of DCpep was verified by ELISA with COE-DCpep antiserum, obtained from mice immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. Briefly, a polystyrene microtiter plate was coated with synthetic DCpep protein. After being washed and blocked, the two-fold serially dilutions of COE-DCpep antiserum were added into the plate in triplicate, and then HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG-specific antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the plate.The substrate o-phenylenediaminedihydrochloride (Sigma, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) was used for color development followed by determination of absorbance at 490 nm.

For determining the PEDV neutralizing activity of the serum antibodies obtained from the immunized mice, 50 µL of sera samples serially diluted two-fold, were each mixed with 50 µL of 200 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) PEDV propagated in Vero cells and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h; the mixture was then transferred to Vero cell monolayers in 96-wellplates. After incubation at 37 • C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 3 days, PEDV-specific cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. In this work, three technical replicates and eight biological replicates per sample were performed, and the positive serum control, negative serum control, virus control, and blank control were designed in parallel.

On day 40 after primary immunization, five mice from each group were sacrificed for preparing splenocytes under aseptic conditions to perform the lymphocyte proliferation assay, as previously described [28] . In brief, the splenocytes in quadruplicates at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells/mL were cultured in RPMI-1640 plus 20% fetal calf serum at 37 • C with 5% CO 2 in a 96-well plate. The cells were stimulated with 0.5 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL of purified PEDV COE protein (specific antigen stimulation) for 60 h at 37 • C. In parallel, stimulation with 5 µg/mL of concanavalin A (ConA) and culture medium was used as the positive control and negative control, respectively. With absorbance measured at 490 nm, lymphocyte proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)according to the manufacturer's instruction.The stimulation index was calculated as follows: the mean reading of triplicate antigen stimulation wells divided by the mean reading of triplicate negative control wells.

For detecting the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels in the culture supernatant of splenocytes, the culture supernatants were collected after antigen stimulation for 60 h, and used in OptEIA Set Mouse IFN-γ and IL-4 (Biosource InternationalInc., Camarillo, CA, USA) antigen-capture ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in quadruplicate. In the culture supernatants, the concentration of IFN-γ and IL-4was calculated using a linear-regression equation and the absorbance values of the standards [29] .

Data are shown as the means ± standard errors of three replicates per test in a single experiment repeated thrice. GraphPad Prism V5.0 (San Diego, CA, USA) was used to perform statistical analyses. Tukey's multiple comparison tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the significance of the difference between means. p-Values less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant and p-values less than 0.01 (p < 0.01) as highly significant.

Overnight cultures of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, pPG-COE/L393, pPG/L393, and L. casei 393 were centrifuged, lysed, and analyzed by western blot assay. As shown in Figure 2A , a specific immunoreactive band of the expected size was observed in the lysate of the recombinant strain pPG-COE/L393 (lane 1) and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 (lane 3), respectively, but not in pPG/L393 (lane 2) and L. casei 393 (lane 4), indicating that the protein of interest was efficiently expressed by the genetically engineered L. casei 393 strains. Moreover, an immunofluorescence assay was used to analyze the cell surface display of the protein of interest. Cells of overnight cultured L. casei 393, pPG/L393, pPG-COE/L393, and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 were incubated with mouse anti-COE monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and then observed by laser confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 3 , green fluorescence observed on the cell surface of pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, but not on pPG/L393 and L. casei 393. The results indicated that the protein of interest was expressed and displayed on the cell surface of pPG-COE/L393 andpPG-COE-DCpep/L393.

As shown in Figure 2B , DCpep protein can be detected with COE-DCpep antiserum which wasdiluted at 1:2-1:64. With the increase of dilution of COE-DCpep antiserum, the immunoreactive is weakened. Moreover, we showed that there is no cross-reactivity between the mouse anti-COE monoclonal antibody and synthetic DCpep protein. 

To evaluate the potential effect of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 on DCs, mice were orally immunized with pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. The costimulatory molecules of DC were analyzed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD80, CD86 and histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, as shown in Figure 2C . The results showed that compared to the pPG-COE/L393, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 induced a significantly increased in the surface expression of CD80 + , CD86 + and MHCII + on CD11c + cells at 36 h post-vaccination in mice (the ratio (%) of the DC marker CD11c + was >80%) which indicated that the oral vaccination of mice with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 effectively elicited the activation of DCs in the MLNs.

The level of anti-PEDV IgG antibodies in mice induced by pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 4A , from the tenth day after primary vaccination, a significant level of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody was induced in mice that were orally administered with pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 (p < 0.01) compared to the pPG/L393 and PBS groups. Moreover, after the booster immunization, a higher level of anti-PEDV IgG antibody was elicited in mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 (p < 0.01) compared to the pPG-COE/L393 group, which indicated that the DC-targeting peptide used as a vaccine adjuvant could enhance the immunogenicity of the antigen and promote the vaccine immune

However, there was no significant difference in the IgG antibody level of the control groups before and after immunization.

Moreover, the anti-PEDV neutralizing activity of the serum antibody obtained from immunized mice was determined ( Figure 4B ). Results showed that the antibody response in mice that received pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 possessed a stronger anti-PEDV neutralizing activity (1:24) than that in mice orally administered with pPG-COE/L393 (1:6), pPG/L393 (1:2) and PBS (1:2). As might be expected, the L. casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing the DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen could effectively elicit an anti-PEDV immune response in vivo.

The intestinal mucosa cell-mediated immune response was further evaluated by measuring the specific anti-PEDV SIgA antibody in the feces, genital tract, and intestinal mucus collected from immunized mice post-immunization via ELISA. The mucosal SIgA levels increased after oral immunization with pPG-COE/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 in the feces ( Figure 5A ), genital tract ( Figure 5B) , and the intestinal mucus ( Figure 5C ) (p < 0.01) compared to those in the control groups of mice orally immunized with pPG/L393 and PBS. Anti-PEDV SIgA in the feces could be detected as early as the sixth day post-immunization with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and the eighth day after primary vaccination with pPG-COE/L393, respectively; following a booster immunization, the SIgA

Anti-PEDV SIgA in the feces could be detected as early as the sixth day post-immunization with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and the eighth day after primary vaccination with pPG-COE/L393, respectively; following a booster immunization, the SIgA levels significantly increased. There was no significant difference in the SIgA level observed in the control groups of mice before and after immunization (p > 0.05). In contrast, the level of SIgA antibody induced by pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 via oral immunization was significantly higher than that induced by pPG-COE/L393. Viruses 2017, 9, 312 10 of 16 levels significantly increased. There was no significant difference in the SIgA level observed in the control groups of mice before and after immunization (p > 0.05).

Splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice and restimulated with the PEDV COE protein in vitro to test the lymphocyte proliferation response by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using Con A as the positive control and cell culture medium as negative control. As shown in Figure 6 , upon stimulation with the purified PEDV COE protein, the stimulation index markedly increased in the group immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 compared to that in the groups immunized with pPG-COE/L393 (p < 0.05), pPG/L393 (p < 0.01) and PBS (p < 0.01), and showed a dose-dependent response. intestinal mucus (C) by ELISA using PEDV as the coating antigen.

As shown in Figure 7 , in response to the PEDV COE antigen, splenocytes obtained from mice orally administered with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 produced significant higher levels of the Th1associated cytokine IFN-γ and the Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 than those in mice receiving pPG-COE/L393 (p < 0.01). 

Currently, porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by PEDV has become the one of the important swine diseases, resulting in huge economic loses for the pig industry. Since 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea has spread throughout the United States and has greatly damaged the American pork industry [30] . The vaccination failure and high death rate seen in the 2010 Chinese outbreak with the re-emergence of a more highly virulent PEDV may have been due to changes in the antigenicity of PEDV based on amino acid mutations [31] . The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV suggests that it is able to elude current vaccine strategies [32] . However, the neutralizing antigenic epitopes of S protein of PEDV have been showed high cross-protection against variant strains [33] . Therefore, the use of core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV isolates S protein to develop PED vaccines should be a useful approach for control of PED epidemics in the region. In this study, a PEDV isolate LJB/15 Figure 6 .

Currently, porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by PEDV has become the one of the important swine diseases, resulting in huge economic loses for the pig industry. Since 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea has spread throughout the United States and has greatly damaged the American pork industry [30] . The vaccination failure and high death rate seen in the 2010 Chinese outbreak with the re-emergence of a more highly virulent PEDV may have been due to changes in the antigenicity of PEDV based on amino acid mutations [31] . The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV suggests that it is able to elude current vaccine strategies [32] . However, the neutralizing antigenic epitopes of S protein of PEDV have been showed high cross-protection against variant strains [33] . Therefore, the use of core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV isolates S protein to develop PED vaccines should be a useful approach for control of PED epidemics in the region. In this study, a PEDV isolate LJB/15 

Currently, porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by PEDV has become the one of the important swine diseases, resulting in huge economic loses for the pig industry. Since 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea has spread throughout the United States and has greatly damaged the American pork industry [30] . The vaccination failure and high death rate seen in the 2010 Chinese outbreak with the re-emergence of a more highly virulent PEDV may have been due to changes in the antigenicity of PEDV based on amino acid mutations [31] . The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV suggests that it is able to elude current vaccine strategies [32] . However, the neutralizing antigenic epitopes of S protein of PEDV have been showed high cross-protection against variant strains [33] . Therefore, the use of core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV isolates S protein to develop PED vaccines should be a useful approach for control of PED epidemics in the region. In this study, a PEDV isolate LJB/15 was used and the nucleotide sequence encoding the COE of PEDV LJB/15 showed more than 98% identity with other PEDV strains isolated in China in recent years. The mucosal immune system, based mostly on SIgA, is the first and a major barrier against invading pathogens targeting the gastrointestinal tract [23] . Therefore, it is necessary to develop oral mucosal vaccines that can induce strong and protective immune responses in the mucosa (to prevent initial infection and pathogen replication), predominantly by means of SigA [34] . L. casei 393, as the antigen delivery carrier used in our study, can adhere to and colonize intestinal mucosa of murine and pigs and to tolerate bile, thus serving as a promising candidate for the delivery of antigenic material to the mucosa in some vaccines [35, 36] . In order to enhance the delivery efficiency of the antigen of interest and reduce the number of vaccinations and the quantity of lactic acid bacteria required for oral administration, intestinal DC-targeting mucosal vaccines were suggested as a promising approach of oral vaccination to induce high mucosal immune responses [10] .

In this study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing a DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen was developed. Expression of the fusion protein was identified by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. The immunogenicity of the orally administered pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was evaluated in mice, and the results showed that oral immunization with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can induce a significant level of anti-PEDV systemic IgG and mucosal SIgA antibody responses, indicating a potential vaccine strategy against PEDV infection.

The antigens of interest intracellularly biosynthesized by lactic acid bacteria could not effectively induce antigen-specific immune responses via oral administration, due mainly to the target antigens cannot effectively interact with intestinal mucosa tissues, in particular DC cells [37] . Thus, in this study, we used the pPG-T7g10-PPT expression vector that was a constitutive cell surface expression plasmid developed by our lab to construct recombinant lactic acid bacteria for the delivery of vaccine antigen. Remarkably, pPG-T7g10-PPT exhibiting a significant advantage as compared with inducible gene expression systems, which require the use of an inductive agent. Additionally, we used phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase (pgsA) from Bacillus subtilis subsp. chungkookjang as an anchor protein and fused the COE protein to its C terminus within pPG-T7g10-PPT expression vector so that it can anchor the protein to the bacterial surface without a sortase [38] , thereby enhancing the immunogenicity. Therefore, in this study, the constitutive cell surface expression system serves as a powerful tool for the construction of recombinant Lactobacillus oral live vaccines.

It is now clear that the intestinal mucosa is the primary site of PEDV infection and transmission. Thus, an effective mucosal immune response requires secretion of both serum IgG and mucosal SIgA. Our data showed that a strong and long-lasting anti-PEDV IgG response was detected in mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and that the anti-PEDV IgG response increased rapidly following a booster immunization. Although the SIgA antibody represents the major humoral mechanism of defense of mucosal surfaces, serum-derived IgG can also contribute significantly to immune defense, by reducing the ability of pathogens to cross the intestinal mucosa and the systemic spread of invasive pathogens, and thereby supplements the mucosal protection provided by SigA [7, 39] . Compared with systemic immunity, the distinctive hallmark of mucosal immunity is the local production of SIgA, which can prevent binding of pathogens to the intestinal epithelial cells and remove pathogens crossing the gastric mucosal barrier [40] . Significantly, the critical advantage of the lactic acid bacteria vaccine is the ability to induce antigen-specific IgA responses in the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we observed here that oral administration of strain pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 expressing a DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen induced substantially elevated levels of anti-PEDV specific SIgA response in the feces, genital tract secretions, and intestinal mucus samples.Ourresults showed that oral administration of strains pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 induced a higher response than did strains pPG-COE/L393 expressing COE antigen only. However, despite statistical significance, the difference is not very large compared to the difference between a positive response and negative controls. On one hand, it may be relevant in mice species, so it need to further studies to show relevance in other species. On the other hand, in this study, the efficient antigen-specific immune responses of PEDV only induced by COE antigen, the presence of DCpep further potentiated the effect of recombinant COE antigen.

Extracellular cytokine analysis is a key method for evaluating the ability of a vaccine to elicit Th1 or Th2 responses [23] . Cytokines produced by CD4 + T helper (Th) lymphocytes could regulate immune system functions, including antibody production and cellular immune responses. The Thl cell response is closely related to cellular immune responses, whereas the Th2 cell response is associated with humoral immunity. The IL-4/IFN-γ ratio is used to indicate the Th1 or Th2 bias of the generated immune response [41] . In this study, we determined the levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 in the immunized mice, and observed that oral immunization with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can significantly elicit IFN-γ and IL-4 production in a ratio of about 1:1, which indicates that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can induce the development of both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses in vivo, similar to the previous finding that use of the DCpep ligand supported both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses [23] . Recently, induction of SIgA against microbes and foreign immunogens was demonstrated to be a T cell-dependent immune response [42] . In this work, the fusion protein COE-DCpep delivered by L. casei canactivate DC, then elicit both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses, indicating that efficient T cell-mediated immunity was critical for SIgA induction. Moreover, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can also elicit a more efficient and robust lymphocyte proliferation response against PEDV COE antigen.

The translational value of studies in mice to the pig species is significant. Many vaccines regarding piglet diarrhea such as PEDV and TGEV were developed in the mice model [21, [43] [44] [45] . Jiang et al. showed that oral L.casei vaccine against TGEV in mice could increase the Treg population [22] . To further evaluate the immune effect of the vaccine in the target animal, Jiang et al, using piglets as models, suggested that the oral L. casei vaccine elicit effective mucosal and systemic immune responses against TGEV infection [46] . We believe that this translational value of the oral L. casei vaccine against TGEV from mice to pig has already provided promising results, especially for the congeneric PEDV which also causes pig diarrhea. Furthermore, DCpep recognizes human, avian, canine, equine, feline and mouse's DCs [10] . So we hypothesize DCpep also bound to pig DCs due to the similarity of the immune system between pig and human. Although mice are not susceptible to PEDV infection, good immune responses of the L.casei vaccine in mice were observed in this study. The results of our study at least demonstrate that L. casei surface-displayed PEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) fused with DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) could act as a novel mucosal vaccine formulation and provide a useful strategy to induce efficient immune responses against PEDV infection. Certainly, further investigations are indispensable to evaluate the immunogenicity and host immunity protection of this vaccine following its oral administration in piglets.

In conclusion, an intestinal DC-targeting oral vaccine strategy using Lactobacillus casei to deliver the core neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen of PEDV conjugated with a DC-targeting peptide as an immune adjuvant was explored to develop an anti-PEDV vaccine for oral administration in this study. We demonstrated that the genetically engineered pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can efficiently induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses against PEDV, suggesting a promising vaccine strategy.

Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity,"In the two decades since their initial discovery, DNA vaccines technologies have come a long way. Unfortunately, when applied to human subjects inadequate immunogenicity is still the biggest challenge for practical DNA vaccine use. Many different strategies have been tested in preclinical models to address this problem, including novel plasmid vectors and codon optimization to enhance antigen expression, new gene transfection systems or electroporation to increase delivery efficiency, protein or live virus vector boosting regimens to maximise immune stimulation, and formulation of DNA vaccines with traditional or molecular adjuvants. Better understanding of the mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines has also enabled better use of the intrinsic host response to DNA to improve vaccine immunogenicity. This review summarizes recent advances in DNA vaccine technologies and related intracellular events and how these might impact on future directions of DNA vaccine development.","Unlike conventional protein-based vaccines, DNA vaccines are based on bacterial plasmids that encode vaccine antigens driven by efficient eukaryotic promoters [1] . Like protein vaccines, DNA vaccines can be delivered through a variety of different routes, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, mucosal, or transdermal delivery. However, unlike protein antigens, the DNA vaccine to be effective must gain entry to the cytoplasm of cells at the injection site in order to induce antigen expression in vivo, thereby enabling antigen presentation on major histocompatability molecules (MHC) and T-cell recognition. DNA vaccines have proved successful in a variety of animal models in preventing or treating infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmunity or allergy [2] . DNA vaccines have many advantages over traditional vaccines with vaccine design being straightforward, generally only requiring one-step cloning into plasmid vector thereby reducing cost and production time. Furthermore, the in vivo expression of an antigen gene driven by a eukaryotic promoter and endogenous post-translational modification results in native protein structures ensuring appropriate processing and immune presentation. From a safety aspect, cloning or synthesis of nucleic acids rather than having to purify proteins from pathogens avoids the need for use of pathogenic microorganisms in vaccine manufacture. Recombinant DNA technology allows almost any kind of molecular manipulation on plasmid DNA, including in vitro mutation, enabling rapid redesign of antigens for pathogens such as influenza that exhibit constant antigenic drift. Plasmid DNA has a good safety record in humans, with the most common side effects being mild inflammation at the injection site. Plasmid DNA is stable at room temperature, avoiding the need for a cold chain during transportation. DNA vaccines enable expressed antigens to be presented by both MHC class I and class II complexes, thereby enabling stimulation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells [3] . Already, several veterinary DNA vaccines have been approved for use, including in fish (infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus), dogs (melanoma), swine (growth hormone releasing hormone) and horses (West Nile virus) [4] . Human applications of the technology have lagged, largely due to the sub-optimal immunogenicity when compared to traditional vaccine approaches. To address these obstacles, a large number of different strategies to enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity have been tested including vector design improvement, antigen codon optimization, use of traditional adjuvant and molecular adjuvants, electroporation, co-expression of molecular adjuvants and prime-boost strategies. In this review, we have specifically focused on promoter selection for DNA vaccine vectors, potential shortcomings of codon optimization, potential new insights from 'omics' studies and RNAi technologies, molecular adjuvants, targeting strategies and technologies for delivery of DNA vaccines. Although many of the described advances have so far only been tested in preclinical models, an increasing number have advanced to the stage of human clinical trial testing.

The first proof-of-concept DNA vaccine was tested in 1990 and involved injecting RNA or DNA vectors expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, and betagalactosidase into mouse skeletal muscle [5] . The expression of reporter genes in vivo was readily detectable and lasted for two months. Subsequent gene gun studies showed that DNA-coated gold micro-projectiles when propelled into mouse skin were highly efficient in inducing antibody responses to the expressed antigen [6] . Finally it was shown that injecting plasmid expressing influenza nucleoprotein into the quadriceps of BALB/c mice could induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes with the immunized mice being protected from challenge with heterologous influenza A virus strains [7] . Similar studies in chickens also demonstrated protection against H7N7 influenza virus challenge after two doses of H7-HA DNA vaccine [8] . Although, these early studies confirmed the potential of using nucleic acids as vaccines, many practical questions still needed to be addressed. The first was the safety of plasmid DNA and the risk that it would integrate into chromosomes and induce activation of oncogenes or mutation of tumour suppressor genes or increase chromosome instability. Subsequent studies confirmed that DNA vaccines have an extremely low probability of human genome integration, at a level lower even than that of spontaneous mutations [9] . Another important question was how DNA vaccines, given their extremely low level of expression, are able to induce immune responses. Compared to the short halflife of injected protein antigens, plasmid DNA can provide tissue expression of antigens over much longer periods of time, thereby potentially priming the immune system better. In regard to antigen presentation, three possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the plasmid DNA is internalised and expressed by somatic cells (e.g. myocytes) and presented by their MHC class I complexes to CD8 T cells; (2) professional antigen presenting cells (APC), e.g. dendritic cells, attracted to the injection site are transfected by the plasmid DNA and the expressed antigens are presented to T cells through MHC class I and II complexes;

(3) phagocytosis of plasmid-transfected somatic cells by professional APC resulting in cross-priming and presentation of antigen to both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Because muscle cells are not able to present antigen through MHC class II as needed to induce CD4 helper T cells, direct or indirect presentation by professional APC is the most likely route.

Intrinsic elements of plasmid DNA can also activate innate immune responses, thereby enhancing adaptive immune responses against the expressed antigens. The innate immune system uses pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) to sense invasion of pathogens and induce downstream production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In both mouse and human, toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) is a cytosolic PRR that binds DNA sequences containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs leading to activation of MyD88dependent signalling pathways [10] . CpG motifs are rare in mammalian genomes, in which they are generally methylated, whereas in bacteria unmethylated CpG motifs are common. Inclusion of built-in CpG motifs in DNA vaccine backbones acts to activate TLR9 after transfection. Ability of DNA vaccines to activate TLR9 has been suggested to be important in prime but not prime-boost contexts [11] . Although CpG motifs can play important roles in vaccine action, TLR9 knockout mice show that TLR9 is not essential for DNA vaccines to work [12, 13] , suggesting other cytosolic DNA sensors may also contribute to DNA vaccine immunogenicity. One such PRR is cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) which, after recognition of dsDNA, induces cGAMP to activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [14] [15] [16] . Another DNA PRR is DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1), which also activates STING and induces type I interferon expression [17] . TBK1, downstream of cGAS and DAI, is important to enhancement of DNA vaccine action [18] . Another important cytosolic DNA sensor is AIM2, which induces inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine production [19, 20] . A recent study showed that both the humoral and cellular antigenspecific adaptive responses to DNA vaccines were significantly reduced in AIM2-deficient mice [21] . The helicase proteins, DHX29 and RIG-I sense cytosolic nucleic acids and may contribute to DNA vaccine action [22] . Other potential DNA sensors include DDX41, IFI16, DNA-PK and MRE11 [23-28]. Hence, these PRR and downstream signalling pathways may provide valuable means to enhance DNA vaccine action (Figure 1 ).

As in traditional vaccine research, small rodent laboratory animals are principally used for DNA vaccine research. For example, the query for ""human"" as the host from DNAVaxDB [29], a database collecting verified DNA vaccine study data returns only 6 records, while a query for ""mouse"" returns 168. Currently, this database has a total of 421 records of verified DNA vaccine studies including other animal models and some that are not clearly labelled. Although most of the studies cited in this review have been undertaken in mouse models rather than humans, they have been of critical importance in understanding the mechanisms by which DNA vaccines work, have helped in improving vector design and delivery methods and been useful for testing of adjuvants and for valuation of safety issues. While vaccine success in small animal models does not guarantee translation to humans, such studies remain an important part of the vaccine development pipeline. An increasing number of these advances from preclinical models have advanced into human clinical trials. As shown in Figure 2 , we retrieved a total number of 162 records of DNA vaccines from a leading human clinical trial database (ClinicalTrials.gov) with more than half of the entries being from after 2011 with only 9% being from before 2005, indicating the relative infancy of human DNA vaccine research. Eighty-two percent of these registered DNA vaccine trials are listed as Phase 1, 13% as Phase 2 and only one trial is listed as Phase 3. Looking at the distribution of diseases DNA vaccines are currently being used to target, ∼ 60% are directed at viruses like HIV, influenza or hepatitis and with ∼ 27% targeting cancer. This is consistent with the need for new types of vaccines for viruses or diseases that are not well addressed using traditional vaccine approaches. Reassuringly, to date no major safety problems have emerged from human DNA vaccine trials.

Codon usage of pathogens is often different to mammalian species, hence codon optimization is generally required to achieve efficient mammalian expression of pathogen proteins. Early studies in mouse models showed successful codon optimization results in enhanced CD8 T cell responses [30] and neutralizing antibody titres [31] and this has been supported by more recent studies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Currently, different academic or commercial algorithms for codon optimization are available to assist DNA vaccine development [37, 38] . However, codon optimization does not always positively correlate with DNA vaccine efficacy. For example, a malaria DNA vaccine study in mice showed that native nucleic acid sequence provided more robust T-cell responses and protection against P. yoelii sporozoite challenge [39] . Another murine study using codon-optimized plasmids that expressed Schistosoma mansoni Sm14 protein showed no increase in immunity or protection against S. mansoni challenge [40] . These discrepancies suggest that assumptions about codon optimization may not always hold true. Many studies have shown that rare-codons may not always be a speed-limiting step and frequently used codons do not guarantee increased protein production. Furthermore, synonymous codons could potentially change protein conformation and function as recently reviewed by Mauro et al [41] . Furthermore, the original pathogen sequences may provide better adjuvant effects through PRR interaction than codon optimized sequences. Therefore, it is best that both original and codon-optimized sequences be always compared in the early phase of developing a new DNA vaccine.

DNA vaccine gene expression is normally driven by a polymerase II type promoter. The endogenous mammalian Pol II promoters are not as strong as virus-derived promoters, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or SV40 promoters (e.g. pcDNA3.1, pVAX1, pVIVO2, pCI, pCMV and pSV2). Early studies showed the CMV immediate early enhancer/promoter had the strongest activity in most cell types and it was thus widely used for DNA vaccine design [42, 43] . Studies using HIV-1 Env DNA vaccines have shown that stronger promoters induced higher protein expression and immune responses [44] . While some viral promoters can efficiently drive antigen expression, this has not always correlated with vaccine efficacy, an effect that may be explained by the viral promoters being sensitive to inhibition by inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα or IFN-γ. Non-viral promoters such as the MHC class II promoter have been shown in mice to overcome this issue [45] . Hence, while the CMV promoter, given its ability to drive a high level of protein expression, remains the first choice for most DNA vaccines, alternative promoters may result in better vaccine outcomes.

Plasmid vectors used for DNA vaccine contain bacterial elements, such as replication signal and selection markers for propagation of E. coli. These elements can pose safety issues and result in poor antigen expression. For example, autoimmunity issues occurred when the Ampicillin selection marker in expression vector pcDNA3.1 was replaced with a Kanamycin selection marker [46] . Removing redundant vector sequences also makes it possible to clone larger DNA vaccine fragments. By using sucrose selection systems, traditional selection marker can be replaced. A sucrose selection construct was designed with incorporation of 72 base pair SV40 enhancer at the 5′ of CMV promoter to increase the extra-chromosomal transgene expression of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) R region at the 3′ of a CMV promoter to increase translation efficiency. Using this system, increased neutralizing antibody titers to HIV-1 gp120 DNA vaccination was achieved in rabbits [47] .

To completely remove bacterial elements, a minicircle DNA (mcDNA) technology has been developed using site-specific recombination based on the ParA resolvase to generate mcDNA [48] or using inducible minicircle-assembly enzymes, PhiC31 integrase and I-SceI homing endonuclease [49] . mcDNA technology has been successfully used in gene therapy experiments in mouse models [50, 51] . A recent study has shown that minicircle dna is superior to plasmid DNA in eliciting antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses [52] . Another study showed a modified novel Mini-Intronic Plasmid (MIP) system was robustly expressed in vivo and in vitro [53] and may thereby serve as a better vaccine backbone. Another study combined electroporation delivery along with minicircle DNA technology resulting in enhanced immunogenicity of a HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine in mice [54] .

Vaccine adjuvants can be used to increase the immunogenicity of otherwise weakly immunogenic antigens. Vaccine adjuvants function through a series of mechanisms including activation of innate immune systems, formation of depot for efficient antigen delivery, induction of different chemokine expression, enhancing antigen uptake and presentation by professional APC and upregulation of co-stimulatory surface molecules [55] . Some such adjuvants have been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Alum has been widely used as a vaccine adjuvant since 1926 [55] , and is thought to work via induction of phagocytic cell death resulting in an immune danger signal [56] . Addition of alum adjuvant to a DNA vaccine encoding HBsAg increased antibody responses in mice, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates [57] . Similarly, formulation of a Toxoplasma gondii DNA vaccine with an alum adjuvant lead to increased survival in BALB/c mice [58] .

As an alternative to alum, a polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta-inulin particles when used in a DNA prime-protein boost vaccine strategy, significantly increased humoral and cellular responses anti-Env-responses in mice [59] . Other approaches to DNA vaccines have used liposomes, which are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayer including phospholipids and cholesterol. Liposomes entrap or bind plasmid DNA and facilitate DNA entry into cells by penetrating the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane [60] . Although use of liposomes for intramuscular antigen delivery needs further improvement to overcome injection-site reactogenicity, they remain promising candidates for mucosal vaccination. A recent study in C57BL/6 mice showed that oral vaccination with cationic liposomeencapsulated pcDNA3.1-based influenza A virus M1 gene induced both humoral and cellular immune responses and protected the mice against respiratory infection [61] . Liposomes have also shown to be effective with intranasal DNA vaccination [62] . However, on the whole, traditional adjuvants have at best only modest effects on DNA vaccine immunogenicity, leading to attempts to develop more potent molecular adjuvant approaches.

Many vaccine plasmid-encoded immune-stimulatory molecules including various cytokine genes or PRR ligands have been tested as 'genetic adjuvants'. These genetic or molecular adjuvants take advantage of recombinant DNA technology, allowing them to be encoded in the same plasmid as the vaccine or a co-administered plasmid.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of membrane-bound PRR that play key roles in the innate immune system. So far, 13 related human TLR genes (TLR1-TLR13) have been identified [63] . TLR3 and TLR9 recognize dsRNA and ssDNA, respectively, and their ligands have been shown to act as molecular adjuvants. Poly (I:C) is a classical TLR3 ligand. Poly (I:C) adjuvant enhanced inducing CTL immunity and decreased tumour burden in mice given a DNA cancer vaccine [64] . Poly (I:C) similarly enhanced responses to a HPV-16 E7 DNA vaccine [65] . A combined CpG/Poly (I:C) adjuvant enhanced the immunogenicity in mice of a DNA vaccine against eastern equine encephalitis virus [62] . Similarly, the TLR9 ligand, CpG, has been successfully used to enhance immunogenicity of DNA vaccines [62, [66] [67] [68] . RIG-I-like receptors are important intracellular proteins that sense double stranded RNA. The RIG-I ligand, eRNA41H, enhanced the humoral immune response to an influenza DNA vaccine [69] . Similarly, a Sendai virus-derived 546-nucleotide ligand of RIG-I enhanced immunogenicity of influenza DNA vaccine [70] . TLRs, RIG-I-like receptor (RLRs), inflammasome and STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensor ligands can all initiate Th2 cell differentiation [71] . Ligands of the cytosolic DNA sensor DAI have also been shown to be efficient molecular adjuvant for DNA cancer vaccines [72] .

Cytokines are naturally produced small proteins critical for immune cell signalling. Cytokine-encoding plasmids can be prepared along with the antigen-expressing plasmid and, local expression of cytokines at the injection site avoids the potential toxicity of systemically administered cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-2 induces the proliferation of T and NK cells, and has been extensively studied as a genetic adjuvant [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . A fusion construct of Mycoplasma pneumoniae p1 gene carboxy terminal region with IL-2 resulted in enhanced vaccine responses in mice [83] . A therapeutic vaccine for chronic myeloid leukemia expressing BCR/ABL-pIRES together with IL-2 also showed enhanced immune responses [84] .

IL-12 is another proinflammatory cytokine secreted by DCs and monocytes. IL12 expression plasmids have been shown to enhance Th1 immune responses [85] . A bicistronic plasmid expressing Yersinia pestis epitopes and IL-12 increased mucosal IgA and serum IgG and protected mice from challenge [86] . IL-12 expression plasmids have also been used for a clinical trial of a weakly immunogenic hepatitis B DNA vaccine [87] . A recent study showed that IL12 genetic adjuvant enhanced hepatitis C DNA vaccine immunogenicity through stimulation of IL-4 and IFN-γ production [88] . A study of a Toxoplasma gondii DNA vaccine showed that the immune responses and survival rate were increased by inclusion of an IL-12 genetic adjuvant compared [89] . An IL-12-adjuvanted HIV/SIV DNA vaccine was also successful in a DNA prime /protein boost study [90] . Evaluation of the PENNVAX-B HIV1 DNA vaccine that is a mixture of 3 expression plasmids encoding HIV-1 Clade B Env, Gag, and Pol, adjuvanted by the IL-12 DNA plasmid showed the vaccine to be safe. Administration of PENNVAX-B with IL-12 plus electroporation had a significant dose-sparing effect and provided superior CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immunogenicity [91] .

GM-CSF is known to recruit APC to immunization site and promote DC maturation. It has been successfully used in DNA vaccines, including with a Pseudorabies virus gB-encoding, SIV encoding and DENV serotype 2 prM/E encoding, vaccines [92] [93] [94] [95] . However, a recent study showed that co-administration of GM-CSF plasmid can have deleterious effects, causing suppression to a DNA vaccine against dengue virus type 1 and type 2 and failing to improve the response induced by HCV vaccine [96] . Furthermore, excessive GM-CSF can expand myeloid suppressor cells and suppress adaptive immune responses. Notably, in preclinical macaque studies GM-CSF expressed in recombinant SIV and MAV vaccines did not enhance protection [97] . Therefore, when used as a molecular adjuvant fine-tuning of GM-CSF expression levels must also be considered.

IL-15 is a cytokine that induces NK and T cell proliferation [98] . A synergistic effect of IL-15 and IL-21 was seen in a DNA vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii infection [99, 100] . Sequential administration of IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15 genes enhanced CD4+ T cell memory to a DNA vaccine against foot and mouth disease [101] . Hence combinations of multiple cytokines in a DNA vaccine formulation or sequential vaccination with cytokines may enhance vaccine efficacy.

Easy cloning of cytokine genes makes them promising candidates as DNA vaccine adjuvants. The moderate but more durable expression at the injection site of plasmidexpressed cytokines helps overcome the problem of the short half-life of many cytokines while minimizing the risk of a systemic cytokine ""storm"" by restricting cytokine expression to the injection site. Although human data on use of cytokine-encoding plasmids as vaccine adjuvants is limited, this appears a promising direction for fine-tuning immune responses to DNA vaccines.

In the past ten years, understanding of immune signalling pathways has greatly progressed, making it possible to test such signalling molecules as vaccine adjuvants. Signalling molecules, TRIF and HMGB1, have been successfully tested as genetic adjuvants for DNA vaccines [102] . Similarly, co-transfection with HSP70 enhanced better CTL responses to DNA vaccines [103] . PD-1 based plasmids were shown to enhance DNA-vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses against HIV [104] . MDA5, a RIG-I like dsRNA receptor, enhanced DNA vaccination against H5N1 influenza virus infection in chickens [105] . Recent studies showed that a plasmid expressing interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF), enhanced CTL and IFN-γ responses against an HIV-1 Tat vaccine [106] , whereas no effects were observed with IRF3 or IRF7 plasmids [106] . NF-κB is a master innate immune regulator. A recent study showed that co-administration of a plasmid expressing NF-κB subunit p65/ RelA enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity [107] . A T-cell transcription factor, Tbet was effective in driving a Th1 response against an Ag85B DNA-based tuberculosis vaccine [108, 109] . DNA, itself, through binding to cellular receptors can activate innate immune pathways. A recent study found that a short noncoding DNA fragment of ∼300bp improved electroporation-mediated gene transfer in vivo [110] , and the immune potency of a HBV vaccine [111] .

shRNA or siRNA as molecular adjuvants RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing process triggered by double-stranded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) structures. Since its discovery, RNAi has mainly been used as a research tool for loss of function studies of target genes [112] . RNAi can be used to down-regulate genes that suppress DNA vaccine action. For example, use of shRNA to knock down caspase 12, a cell death mediator that is upregulated after DNA vaccination, increased plasmid gene expression and T-cell and antibody responses [113] . Similarly, depletion by RNAi of Foxo3, a critical suppressive regulator of T cell proliferation, increased the efficacy of a HER-2/neu cancer vaccine [114] . Knockdown of the IL10 receptor was also shown to enhance vaccine potency [115] . Furthermore, blockade of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) by RNAi augmented DC-mediated T cell responses and antiviral immunity in HBV transgenic mice [116] . A recent cancer vaccine study that combined IL-10 siRNA and CpG showed increased protective immunity against B cell lymphoma [117] . Another cancer therapeutic vaccine showed that GM-CSF combined with shRNA knockdown of furin augmented vaccine efficacy [118] . Knockdown of APOBEC expression by RNAi also enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity [119] . Thus use of RNAi against target genes that limit plasmid expression might be a powerful new strategy for DNA vaccine enhancement, especially for tumour vaccines, but with the safety of this approach still needing to be fully evaluated in animal studies.

DNA vaccines mainly transfect muscle cells resulting in poor antigen presentation due to lack of co-stimulation. Instead gene expression can be targeted to professional APC to enhance vaccine action. One strategy is direct transfection of DC. A conventional approach is to use ex vivo-engineered DC vaccines, where enriched DC from blood are transfected with DNA before being given back to the patient. One recent mouse study showed that DC transfected with Spermine-dextran/CCR7 plasmid/gp100 plasmid migrated to lymph nodes when re-administered to mice [120] . Given the high cost of DC vaccines this approach is only likely to be used for therapeutic cancer vaccines [121] . More recent studies improved the efficacy of plasmid DNA by adding targeting protein, polymer or peptides. Liu et al. translated the ""albumin hitchhiking"" approach to DNA vaccines by using the lipophilic albumin-binding tail to target the cargo to DC [122] . Skin delivery of DNA loaded into polymer forming nanoparticles has been used to target Langerhans cells [123] . The barrier of direct targeting DNA to DC was overcome by incubating DNA vaccines with a small peptide derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein fused to protamine residues [124] . In addition to direct targeting of DNA to DC, another strategy is to co-express DC-targeting molecules in the DNA vaccine construct. Many such targeting approaches have been successful in mouse models, utilising a wide range of targeting molecules including FIRE (F4/80-like receptor), CIRE (C-type lectin receptor), Cle9A, Flt3, DEC205, xrc1 or synthetic MHC class IItargeting peptides [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] . Subcellular targeting is another strategy for enhancing plasmid-encoded antigen processing and/or presentation. Using E1A targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum or LAMP targeting to lysosome can greatly enhance DNA vaccine efficacy [133, 134] . Targeting of the autophagy pathway enhanced the efficacy of tuberculosis DNA vaccines [135] [136] [137] . Similarly, a short polypeptide from herpes simplex virus that induces antigen aggregation and autophagosomal degradation enhanced T-cell-responses when co-expressed with chicken ovalbumin [138] . The plasmid pATRex expressing the aggregation domain of TEM8 induces intracellular protein aggregation, autophagy and caspase activation and this translated to an increased IgG1 response by a DNA vaccine encoding Plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein 4/5 [139] . Fusion of the PADRE MHC class II epitope to a cancer DNA vaccine was also able to induce stronger antigen-specific responses [140] .

Targeting DNA vaccine to specific cells or subcellular compartments can greatly increase antigen processing and presentation and promote the desired immune responses, while minimizing systemic toxicity. It is thereby a very promising area of molecular adjuvant development. Among different ways of targeting DC, skin targeting methods (intradermal injection or micro-needles) may be superior to traditional intramuscular or subcutaneous injection routes [141] and this will be further discussed in the section on vaccine delivery devices.

Developments in next-generation sequencing, microarrays, and high throughput proteomics approaches now provide opportunity to identify additional potential molecular adjuvants for DNA vaccines. One recent proteomics study screened proteins for interaction with plasmid DNA and found that human serum amyloid P (SAP) inhibited plasmid transfection and enhanced clearance. SAP may contribute to the low efficacy of DNA vaccines in humans, with its suppressive effects being much weaker in other species [142] . Therefore, it might be possible to include shRNA against SAP as a molecular adjuvant for human DNA vaccines. Systems biology approaches have also been used to analyze the molecular signatures that correlate with a positive immunization response. For example, CaMKIV kinase expression levels at day 3 were negatively correlated with subsequent influenza antibody titers [143] . This provides an example of the application of systems biology to identify biomarkers that predict vaccine effectiveness [144] [145] [146] [147] with identified molecules serving as potential new candidate molecular adjuvants.

The immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is limited in humans. Prime-boost approaches like DNA prime/protein boost, DNA prime/viral vector boost (e.g. using adenovirus) and even protein prime/DNA boost provide opportunities to develop more effective human DNA vaccine regimens. Previous studies have used DNA/protein or DNA/Ad-vector approaches for HIV vaccination [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] . A recent study using a heterologous prime/boost approach showed enhanced immunogenicity of therapeutic vaccines for hepatitis C virus, with higher protection in a recombinant Listeria-NS3 1a -based surrogate challenge model [153] . Another study showed that a DNA prime/adenovirus boost malaria vaccine encoding P. falciparum CSP and AMA1 induced cell-mediated immunity and sterile protection [154] . Similar studies also showed greatly enhanced immunogenicity with a peptide prime/DNA boost or BCG prime/DNA boost, [155, 156] . The interval between prime and boost was also important for best vaccine efficacy [157, 158] . The underlying mechanisms of the effectiveness of prime-boost strategy still remain poorly understood, but we hypothesize that the lower antigen expression from DNA vaccines may preferentially prime T-helper cell responses with the humoral response being subsequently boosted by the protein or viralvector boost.

To overcome the main issue of low DNA vaccine immunogenicity, efficient delivery to plasmid to preferred tissues or cells is a critical research area. Just as in the case of conventional protein vaccines, DNA vaccines can be administrated by many different methods, including conventional syringe injection, gene gun, electroporation (EP) [159, 160] , Li nanoparticles [161] , microneedles [162] and liposomes [163] . Based on animal studies, EP combined with a prime-boost strategy may give the highest immunogenicity. However, even though clinical trials of EP have been successfully undertaken [164, 165] and shown dosesparing effects [166] , EP is not guaranteed to increase vaccine immunogenicity [165] , and may not be practicable for many human vaccines. Hence simpler but more efficient methods are still needed for DNA vaccine delivery. Potential candidates include needle-free skin delivery or pulmonary delivery. Needle-free skin gene delivery systems use high-pressure fine streams to target different skin depths. The delivered DNA is then able to transfect Langerhans cells in the skin. Commercial devices such as Biojector or Pharmajet have been shown to be able to deliver DNA vaccines in animal models and human trials. A recent study using a rabbit model showed that an influenza DNA vaccine delivered by needle-free IDAL vaccinator elicited a similar antibody response to intradermal electroporation [167] . Another clinical trial used Biojector to deliver an HIV-1 DNA vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP) with good tolerance and priming for CD8+ T cell IFN-γ production and antibody responses after rAd5 boosting [168] . Considering its safety, low-cost and ease of use and the ability to deliver dry-coated plasmids [169, 170] , needle-free injection devices show much promise for DNA vaccine delivery.

Intranasal or intrapulmonary delivery of DNA vaccines are additional alternatives although the number of human studies of such administration routes is very limited. In theory, pulmonary vaccination should expose the delivered DNA and expressed antigens to a large surface of epithelial and immune cells while avoiding the need for needle injection [171] [172] [173] [174] . A recent study showed that cation-complexed HIV-1 plasmid DNA vaccines applied topically to the murine pulmonary mucosa induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses models [175] . Furthermore, when complexed with PEI a pulmonary DNA vaccine induced significant influenza protection [175] . Another study showed that pulmonary DNA immunization mediated protective anti-viral immunity through enhancement of airway CD8+ T cell responses [176] . The biggest challenge for pulmonary delivery is the need for specialized delivery methods. Conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers fail to deliver large intact biomolecules like plasmid DNA to the lung because of the high shear and cavitational stresses present during nebulization. However, recent progress in the area of delivery methods may change this, with surface acoustic wave nebulization being shown to efficiently deliver an aerosolized plasmid DNA vaccine in rats or sheep with induction of systemic and mucosal antibody responses [177] .

Progress in overcoming the low immunogenicity problem of DNA vaccines has been steadily made. Recent advances are summarized in Table 1 . Along with better understanding of immune pathways and vaccine action, a large array of immune receptors, signalling molecules, cytokines and transcription factors are in the process of being tested as DNA vaccine adjuvants. It is likely that at least some of these will turn out to be potent adjuvants, although each will need to be carefully assessed for human safety and tolerability. The ability to present native conformational immunogens and be able to prime both humoral and cellular immune responses are the hallmarks of DNA vaccines. Considering the suitability Li in chicken embryo fibroblasts requires codon optimization for production of naked DNA and

• DNA vaccines have the benefits of being able to express antigens in their native conformation inside cells and thereby induce CD8+ T cell responses.

• Currently more than 150 human DNA vaccine trials are ongoing or completed.

• Animal and human trial data has showed good tolerance and safety of DNA vaccines.

• Codon optimization and strong viral promoters do not always enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity.

• Minicircle DNA or Mini-Intronic Plasmid systems are promising for bacterial element-free DNA vaccine production.

• Molecular adjuvants including plasmid-encoded cytokines and signalling molecules and RNA knockdown strategy can be used to enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity.

• Needle-free skin delivery or pulmonary delivery methods may be promising directions for future use.

Cholesteryl Pullulan Encapsulated TNF-Nanoparticles Are an Effective Mucosal Vaccine Adjuvant against Influenza Virus,"We encapsulated tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-), a major proinflammatory cytokine, into cholesteryl pullulan (CHP) to prepare TNF/CHP nanoparticles. In this report, we describe the immune-enhancing capability of the nanoparticles to act as a vaccine adjuvant. TNF/CHP nanoparticles showed excellent storage stability and enhanced host immune responses to external immunogens. The nanoparticles were effective via the nasal route of administration for inducing systemic IgG 1 as well as mucosal IgA. We applied the nanoparticles in a model experimental influenza virus infection to investigate their adjuvant ability. TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with a conventional split vaccine protected mice via nasal administration against a lethal challenge of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Mechanistic studies showed that the nanoparticles enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and moderately induced the expression of inflammation-related genes in nasopharynx lymphoid tissue (NALT), leading to the activation of both B and T cells. Preliminary safety study revealed no severe toxicity to TNF/CHP nanoparticles. Slight-tomoderate influences in nasal mucosa were observed only in the repeated administration and they seemed to be reversible. Our data show that TNF/CHP nanoparticles effectively enhance both humoral and cellular immunity and could be a potential adjuvant for vaccines against infectious diseases, especially in the mucosa.","In the last few decades, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] and avian/swine influenza [2] impacted humanity's disease control systems to reconsider and have raised demand for the development of next-generation vaccines.

Vaccines are the most effective interventions against infectious diseases. Many vaccines, however, are effective only in preventing onset and aggravation of symptoms and less effective in preventing infection, in particular, respiratory infections such as influenza. Some reasons for this are that the major administration routes of conventional vaccines, including subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramuscular (i.m.) one, only induce neutralizing IgG antibody in blood and not mucosal IgA antibody, which is effective in preventing infection. In addition, the efficacy of IgG antibody against mutated viruses is very limited because it has highly restricted cross-protective capabilities. Conversely, IgA antibody on mucosa shows wide cross-protection and can block infection [3, 4] . When immunizations are delivered at the mucosa, IgA antibody is induced on mucosal surfaces throughout the body. As mucosal vaccination induces immunity in both the systemic and mucosal compartments [5, 6] , enhanced antigen-specific mucosal immunity is a clear goal for nextgeneration vaccines. Mucosal and particularly nasal vaccines are promising because of their effectiveness in preventing infection via the respiratory tract. Nasal vaccines have the additional benefit of improved patient compliance and greater clinical convenience.

One significant drawback of mucosal vaccines is that they generally do not induce strong enough immune responses. The recent component-split vaccines, while avoiding many negative patient reactions, tend to be less immunogenic by themselves, even in the case of intravenous (i.v.) or i.m. administration. Generally, children and the elderly tend to respond less to vaccinations, which may lower the preventive power of the population [7] . Adjuvants must be administered simultaneously with the vaccine in order to enhance vaccinespecific immune responses. Among the adjuvants, Alum salts have been used the most, but they are neither suitable for all vaccines nor always capable of eliciting the desired immune responses. Other types of adjuvants have been under development, such as liposomes, emulsions, and their combinations [8, 9] . The development of safe, effective, and suitable adjuvants for various vaccines is expected to meet the new type vaccines.

Tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) is a major proinflammatory cytokine primarily produced by T cells and macrophages [10] . Originally, it was found as a potent antitumor factor and is now known to play an integral role in host defense, including innate and adaptive immune activation, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and subsequent T cell activation, as well as contributing to inflammatory responses [11, 12] . Interestingly, it was recently shown that TNFexerted adjuvant activities against pathogenic infections [13, 14] . Although the molecule has attracted the interest of many investigators and there were some attempts to develop TNF-as a vaccine adjuvant, successful results have not been reported, probably because TNF-causes unfavorable biological reactions when administered systemically and is rapidly degraded at mucosal surfaces when delivered mucosally. To overcome this, some investigators have attempted to generate protease-resistant mutant TNF-molecules [15, 16] .

In order to establish safer and more effective ways to administer bioactive substances, such as TNF-, drugdelivery systems (DDS), nanoparticles made of biocompatible polymers, have attracted growing interest recently. One such material, cholesteryl pullulan (CHP), is the polysaccharide pullulan chemically modified with cholesteryl groups [17, 18] . It forms self-assembly nanoparticles in aqueous solution and entraps various molecules in its internal space through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, it protects the entrapped molecule from mechanical/chemical or enzymatic attacks outside the particle and acts as a superior carrier for delivery, achieving slow release of the encapsulated materials [19] [20] [21] . It has been shown that CHP nanoparticles are efficiently transferred to antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and/or DC and that they elicit strong immune responses [22, 23] . CHP is under vigorous investigation for establishing novel vaccine therapies against several types of cancers [24] [25] [26] .

In this report, we encapsulated human TNF-into CHP resulting in TNF/CHP nanoparticles. Then, we examined the potential of the nanoparticles as a nasal vaccine adjuvant and protection against lethal influenza infection in a mouse model and conducted mechanistic analyses.

Pullulan (CHP), Influenza Virus, and Influenza Virus HA Vaccine (IVV). Human TNF-was prepared as previously described [27] . Briefly, TNF-protein was produced by a human B cell lymphoblastoid cell line, BALL-1, stimulated with hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) and highly purified through a series of chromatography columns, including a specific monoclonal antibody column. The endotoxin level of the purified TNF-was determined to be less than 300 pg/mg protein.

CHP is a partially (1-3% of glucose units) modified polysaccharide, pullulan, with cholesteryl residues (PURE-BRIGHT CP-100T). It was purchased from NOF Co. (Tokyo, Japan).

Influenza 

Two hundred fifty g/mL TNF-and 12 mg/mL CHP were mixed, sterilized by filtration, and incubated at 37 ∘ C for 5 d. During the incubation, CHP encapsulated TNF-molecules to form nanoparticles. Unencapsulated TNF-was removed by sizeexclusion chromatography with a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). The size of the particles was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). To estimate the amount of TNF-encapsulated, nanoparticles were treated with 100 mg/mL methyl--cyclodextrin (Me--CD, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO) at 37 ∘ C for 2 h to disrupt the particle structure and release TNF-, as described [21] . The amount was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system described below.

The amount of human TNF-was determined by an ELISA system established in-house in Hayashibara Co., Ltd. Briefly, an anti-human TNF--specific mouse antibody (MAb-TNF--5) was immobilized in 96-well plates (NUNC-IMMUNO PLATE U96, Nunc, Rochester, NY). After incubating with the samples, horse radish peroxidase-(HRPO-) labeled anti-human TNF--specific mouse antibody (MAb-TNF--1-HRPO) was added to the wells. Then, o-phenylenediamine, a substrate for HRPO, was added to detect the immune complex and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Purified human TNF-protein was used as the standard. This ELISA system recognized the active trimeric TNF-molecule only and the detection limit was 0.2 ng/mL.

Animals. BALB/c mice (8-week-old females) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc. (Yokohama, Japan) and used after a week of quarantine and acclimation. This study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Care Committee of Hayashibara Co., Ltd., and all animal experiments and procedures were in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Hayashibara Co., Ltd.

Mice were anesthetized with sevoflurane and the antigen and/or adjuvant preparations (15 L a nasal cavity, 30 L/mouse) were administered nasally at the indicated times.

2.6. Preparation of Blood, Nasal Wash, Nasopharynx-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT), and Nasal Passage Cells. Blood and nasal wash were obtained from mice. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with ether and blood was taken from the abdominal aorta with heparinized syringes. The jaw was incised bilaterally and the nasal cavity, in vicinity to root of the tongue, was exposed. The nasal cavity was washed with saline and the wash was recovered. The blood and the nasal wash were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 8 min and stored at −80 ∘ C until examination. Then, after thorough washing of the nasal cavity with saline, the upper palates were removed and the NALTs were isolated under the microscope. NALT cells were suspended with 100 m strainer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and recovered by centrifugation. The nasal passage cells were prepared as reported [28] . Briefly, the nasal passage cells were obtained by chipping off from the wall of the nasal cavity, minced, and dispersed with collagenase D (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The cells were suspended with strainers and separated by biphasic centrifugation with 40% and 75% Percoll (GE Healthcare) at 1,000 rpm for 25 min. The cells in the boundary phase were collected and washed with RPMI 1640 medium. 1 and IgA Responses. Antibody responses in the plasma and the nasal wash of the immunized animals were determined using ELISA. IVV was immobilized in microplates and the respective antibody in the plasma or the nasal wash was examined. As the indicators, HRPOlabeled rat anti-mouse IgG 1 (Life Technologies Co., Carlsbad, CA) for IgG 1 and HRPO-labeled goat anti-mouse IgA (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL) for IgA were used with o-phenylenediamine. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm.

Specificity of antibody response was examined by detection of neutralizing activity in plasma against HAs of influenza type A H1N1, type A H3N2, and type B. Plasma from mice immunized with IVV and TNF/CHP nanoparticles were subjected to hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay performed by FALCO biosystems Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). The results were expressed as geometric mean titer (GMT).

Sixty-eight hours after the 3rd nasal immunization, NALT cells were prepared from mice as described. After being blocked with FcR blocker (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-(FITC-) labeled anti-mouse CD11c antibody and FITC-labeled antimouse CD80 antibody, or FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD86 antibody (Milteny Biotec), and subjected to flow cytometry (FCM) analysis using a flow cytometer (GALLIOS, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).

Ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was labeled with Alexa 647 using the Alexa Fluor 647 labeling kit (Life Technologies Co., Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting Alexa-labeled OVA was used as an indicator antigen for nasal administration to mice with or without the TNF/CHP nanoparticles as an adjuvant. Six h after administration of 10 g labeled OVA, the NALT cells and the nasal passage cells were prepared from the mice as described above, blocked with FcR blocker (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), stained with phycoerythrin-(PE-) labeled anti-mouse CD11c antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and subjected to FCM analysis. The results were examined with a flow cytometry analysis software, Gatelogic (Inivai Technologies Pty Ltd., Mentone, Victoria, Australia). The antigen uptake was estimated by the florescence intensity of Alexa 647 against intensity of CD11c + cells, activated dendritic cells (DCs). (Table 1) were prepared (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Expression levels were normalized with the level of GAPDH and quantified by quantitative PCR with a Roche LyteCycler 480 (Roche).

The NALT cells pooled from 8 mice were cultured for 3 d in microplates with feeder splenocytes treated with 50 g/mL mitomycin for 30 min, in the presence of the IVV antigen. The cell proliferation was examined with alamarBlue (Life Technologies Co.) and represented the difference (Δ) of fluorescence intensity between cases with and without IVV. The culture supernatant was recovered at 16 h and the cytokineproducing cells were examined using the ELISpot PLUS mouse IL-4 and the ELISpot Plus mouse IFN-(Mabtech AB, Nacka Strand, Sweden) kits. The results represented the difference of the number (Δ) of cytokine-positive cells/10 6 cells between cases with and without IVV stimulation.

Mice were anesthetized with sevoflurane and were administered nasally the preparation (15 L per nasal cavity, 30 L/mouse) once a week for 3 weeks ( = 10). Samples were prepared by mixing 1 : 1 IVV and the nanoparticle preparation (5 g/mouse) or Cholera Toxin B-subunit (CTB) (0.8 g/mouse, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) before use. Seven d after the final immunization, the mice were challenged with influenza virus (Puerto Rico/8/34, 160 pfu/50 L) nasally. The dosage of virus corresponded to 10 LD 50 for the mice. The virus-challenged mice were monitored daily for body weight and signs of morbidity. Mice that were moribund or that had lost more than 20% of their body weight were considered to have reached an experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized by anesthetization with pentobarbital.

In reference to the OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals [29], preliminary safety study was performed. Mice (4 heads each sex, each group) were administered nasally the TNF/CHP nanoparticle preparation combined with the IVV once a week either once or four times for acute or repeated toxicity, respectively. In addition, some animals went through 4 weeks of repeated administrations followed by 2 weeks of cessation and were examined. The general symptoms were examined once a day and body weights and food consumption were recorded weekly. Body temperatures were recorded at 0 d before and 2 h after the administrations. The other items (ophthalmic examination, hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, blood antibody titer, autopsy findings, and histopathological analyses of major organs) were inspected at 3 d for acute toxicity, and 0, 24, and 37 d for repeated toxicity. Blood biochemistry analyses were performed by Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Furthermore, nasal mucosal tissue, the administration site, was examined histopathologically.

All values are expressed as mean values ± SD or SEM. The Student -test was used for comparison between 2 groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey test was used to determine the significance of differences for multiple comparisons. Differences with a probability value of < 0.05 were considered to be significant.

Nanoparticles. CHP encapsulated active trimer TNF-to form stable nanoparticles. Based on preliminary experiments, the optimal conditions for preparing the nanoparticles were incubating 250 g/mL TNF-with 12.1 mg/mL CHP at 37 ∘ C for 5 d. The encapsulating process was temperature-and time-dependent and it hardly occurred in the 4 ∘ C conditions. Under these conditions, typically more than 90% of the TNF-was encapsulated into CHP complexes, and the resulting nanoparticles were relatively uniform. The peak and average sizes of the 

Stability of the nanoparticles in Dulbecco's phosphate buffer (D-PBS) was evaluated at 25 ∘ C. To estimate the amount of encapsulated TNF-, Me--CD was used to disrupt the CHP complex to release the TNF-inside the particles. The results showed that the nanoparticle retained its integrity and kept TNFmolecules active inside the complex in aqueous solution at room temperature for at least 21 d ( Table 2 ). The integrity of the particles was also maintained more than 80% even after five cycles of freezing and thawing (data not shown). These results showed that the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were remarkably stable. However, upon contact with high concentrations of dissolved proteins, such as albumin in serum, the nanoparticles are prone to release the encapsulated TNFrapidly, probably being replaced with the proteins outside as reported [30] (data not shown).

Although TNF-is known to have immune-enhancing activity [13] , severe and unfavorable effects have hampered its practical use. We thought that delayed release of the TNF/CHP nanoparticle might promote the beneficial effects of TNF-, such as a vaccine adjuvant, while avoiding harmful events. We examined the adjuvant activity of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles, for example, enhanced induction of antigen-specific antibodies in mice, particularly in the case of nasal administration. The results show that the nasally administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with IVV induced significant levels of IgA in the nasal wash, as well as IgG 1 in blood plasma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). These results are comparable to those of the positive control CTB, a model adjuvant [31] . However, IVV with CHP alone (without TNF-) and with free TNF-failed to induce significant levels of antibodies compared with IVV alone. The TNF/CHP nanoparticles alone did not induce any measurable antibody response against IVV. Also, we examined antigen specificity further by hemagglutinin-(HA-) specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay because the IVV we used was consisting of different types of influenza virus. The TNF/CHP nanoparticles with IVV induced significant HI activity against all types of HA used (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) (Figure 2(c) ). The effects were comparable to those of CTB. Further, the antigen-specific T cell responses of the animals were examined using splenocytes. IVV-specific proliferation in the TNF/CHP nanoparticle group was comparable to that of CTB (Figure 3(a) ). Regarding cytokine production as measured by ELISpot, IVV alone increased the IFN--producing cells and either adjuvant alone (TNF/CHP nanoparticle or CTB) suppressed the IFN-production. Instead, IL-4-producing cells were increased by nasal administration of the vaccine and adjuvant combination (Figure 3(b) ). The TNF/CHP nanoparticles enhanced host immunity and the effect seemed stronger than that of CTB, a vaccine adjuvant positive control.

Challenge of Influenza Virus to Mice. To directly address the stimulatory effect of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles on protective immunity as a vaccine adjuvant, we carried out an experimental lethal influenza virus challenge of immunized mice. The mice were nasally immunized with the IVV (0.3 g/mouse) combined with or without TNF/CHP nanoparticles (corresponding to 5 g TNF-/mouse) once a week for 3 times. Mice were challenged with influenza virus A/PR8 strain (160 pfu/mouse, 10 LD 50 ) 7 d after the final immunization. The mice that received the IVV only all died by 8 d after the challenge, almost the same as Figure 3 : Proliferation and cytokine production by splenocytes from mice nasally administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles. Mice were nasally administered IVV and TNF/CHP nanoparticles or CTB as described. Splenocytes were prepared from the mice and IVV-specific proliferation and IL-4 and IFN--producing cells were examined with alamarBlue and ELISpot, respectively. The results represent the difference (Δ) between cases with and without IVV antigen stimulation. (a) Proliferation response, (b) cytokine-producing cells. Blue column, IL-4 production; red column, IFN-production (mean ± SEM, = 8). * < 0.05 versus saline/IVV. without the IVV immunization. The TNF/CHP nanoparticles without the IVV delayed the onset of death a little, but eventually all the animals died. On the contrary, combined administration of the IVV and the TNF/CHP nanoparticles showed a highly protective effect on the mice and 90% of the animals survived. The effect was comparable to that of CTB as an adjuvant. Free TNF also showed a somewhat protective effect. Interestingly, CHP only (without TNF-) provided a certain level of protection, as we observed up to 50% survival ( this memory was maintained for more than 91 d, and these mice responded to a boosting challenge of the IVV (data not shown). These data indicate that the nanoparticles induced systemic immunity and long-lived memory. Overall, our data demonstrate that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are effective as a vaccine adjuvant for nasally delivered IVV.

Being focused on the nasal route of vaccination, we examined immune cells in the nasal tissues after the immunization. Sixty-eight h after the nasal immunization 3 times, NALT cells were prepared from mice and expression of surface markers, a marker for DCs (CD11c) and activation markers for B cells (CD80 and CD86), was examined by flow cytometry. The ratio of CD11c + /CD80 + cell population was 0.20%, 0.30%, and 0.33% for saline, IVV, and IVV with TNF/CHP nanoparticles, respectively. The ratio of CD11c + /CD86 + population was 0.33%, 0.44%, and 0.50% for saline, IVV, and IVV with TNF/CHP nanoparticles, respectively ( Figure 5 ). Even though the degree was relatively small in extent, IVV vaccination with or without TNF/CHP nanoparticles activated DCs and B cells. But the effect of TNF/CHP nanoparticles was not so prominent.

To find out the mechanisms by which the nasally administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles exerted immune-enhancing activity, we next focused on early immune response of nasal mucosal tissues. In these experiments, we used Alexa 647-labeled ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen and assessed antigen uptake by DCs in the NALT and nasal passage cells after 6 h of immunization by flow cytometry. The results were analyzed with Gatelogic software and expressed as fluorescence values of Alexa 647 + /CD11c + cells. Immunization of mice with OVA combined with TNF/CHP nanoparticles activated antigen uptake by both NALT and nasal passage DCs, and the nasal passage DCs responded particularly well. TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed to stimulate DCs most in the nasal mucosal immune tissue ( Figure 6 ).

To understand the nasal tissue activation caused by the TNF/CHP nanoparticles soon after immunization, we conducted gene expression profiling in NALT cells 6 h after nasal immunization with the IVV antigen combined with or without the nanoparticles. By scattering analyses, the gene expression of inflammation-related molecules, for example, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, fibronectin-1, CD14, TLR 2, TLR3, IL-1 , IL-1 family 9, and IL-6, was found to be significantly upregulated (data not shown). For further analyses of the inflammatory signaling molecules induced by TNF/CHP nanoparticles, we focused on the molecules listed in Table 1 and performed quantitative PCR analyses on 2, 6, and 26 h activated NALT cells. Although CHP itself did not show significant immune-enhancing activity, the inflammatory markers were enhanced when the adjuvants were included (TNF/CHP nanoparticles, free TNF, and CTB). Among the molecules tested, significant increases in the expression of IFN-, IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-6, CXCL2, IL-12 , CD14, and LPS binding protein were found. The degree of enhancement varied from gene to gene. In particular, the expression of IL-6 and IL-12 was intensely enhanced. For these genes, free TNF resulted in strong and early increase in expression. The enhancement tended to be greater at 2 h than 6 or 26 h (Figure 7 ). Expression profiles with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were similar to those with free TNF, although the magnitudes were not as great. Although the expression of IL-12 was prominent when CTB was used as an adjuvant, the IL-12 response was much lower with TNF/CHP nanoparticles.

General safety was preliminarily examined. Mice (4 in each sex) nasally administered the TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with the IVV either once or four times were subjected to an acute and a repeated toxicity study, respectively. The general symptoms, ophthalmic examinations, body weight, body temperature, hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, autopsy findings, and histochemical analyses with hematoxylin-eosin staining were inspected.

Weight, and Body Temperature. No general symptoms and behavioral anomaly in either male or female animals were correlated with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and the IVV treatment during the study period. In ophthalmic examinations, there were no test material-related ocular findings observed. Body weights and body temperatures in the both sexes during the treatment were not statistically different among the treatment groups (data not shown).

Hematology evaluations were also performed during and at the end of study. There were no differences in any of the parameters (white blood cell, red blood cell, hematocrit, lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte) that were considered to be due to the administration of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and the IVV. For blood biochemistry, total protein, albumin, urea nitrogen, creatinine, Na + , K + , Cl − , Ca 2+ , inorganic phosphate, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), amylase (AMY), -glutamyl transpeptidase ( -GT), total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, total bilirubin, and glucose were examined. All differences found during the The vaccine (IVV 0.3 g/mouse) and adjuvant preparation (TNF/CHP nanoparticles 5 g/mouse as TNF-) were nasally administered to mice once a week up to 4 weeks. After that, 2 weeks of cessation period was set (4 + 2 weeks). Blood plasma was prepared and the anti-IVV IgG 1 antibody was titrated ( = 4). n.d., not detected. study fell within historical control value ranges and were not considered test material-related (data not shown).

Urobilinogen, bilirubin, ketone body, glucose, protein, pH, specific gravity, nitrite salt, and leucocyte were examined during the study period. There were no TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related changes observed (data not shown).

Titer. The anti-IVV IgG 1 in blood was examined after the administration of TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV. No detectable antibody was induced by the single administration. After the second administration, however, the antibody was induced by only the TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with the IVV and the titer was maintained even after 2 weeks of cessation period. The effectiveness of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvant was confirmed. In this experiment, females tended to respond to the immunization higher (Table 3) .

Gross pathology of all the animals was examined at the end of the study. There were few gross pathology finding and none of them were considered to be the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVVrelated. The major organs (brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, ovary, testis, spleen, adrenal, and thymus) were measured at the end of the study in all of the animals. No organ weight change was noted as test material-related (data not shown).

3.8.6. Histopathology. Histopathology of tissues from animals in each group was examined and there were few histopathological findings, and none of them were considered to be TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related. As the nasal administration, possible harmful effects on central nervous system were concerned. However, no abnormalities in the brain, especially olfactory bulb, were noted in any animals after histological examination. On the other hand, there were some influences observed in nasal mucosal tissue. First, single administration of any specimen showed no effects. In the case of repeated administration, IVV did not affect the mucosal tissues greatly except slight infusion probably caused by repeated stimulation. On the other hand, TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with IVV induced slight-to-moderate infusion and infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells). The findings, however, diminished in trace proportions after 2 weeks of cessation period. No excessive inflammatory symptoms, such as formation of edema or fibrosis, were noted ( Figure 8 ).

In summary, no significant change due to the administration of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV was observed in the acute toxicity study. In the repeated toxicity study, slight-to-moderate infusion and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed at the nasal mucosa, the administration site. This response, however, seemed reversible. Overall, no immunotoxicity was detected. Although further evaluation is required, our results demonstrated that the toxicity of TNF/CHP nanoparticles is relatively low.

In this study, we attempted to test a new adjuvant preparation with a potent immunoregulatory cytokine and a DDS material. Human TNF-was successfully incorporated into CHP complexes to form stable nanoparticles. The preparation process was efficient and the resulting nanoparticles were relatively uniform ( Figure 1 ) and robust. The nanoparticles had excellent storage stability for more than 3 weeks at room temperature ( Table 2 ). Many medical formulations, especially biological ones, require storage at low temperatures or freezing. On the contrary, the TNF/CHP nanoparticles could be stored in solution and without refrigeration. Our formulation offers improved convenience of handling and transportation.

Me--CD is known to interact with cholesteryl groups and disrupt CHP complexes to release the substance inside the particles [21] . In the case of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles, the amount of Me--CD required to disrupt the particle structure was approximately 100 mg/mL, much higher than 0.3 mg/mL reported in the case of IL-12/CHP nanoparticles [21] , suggesting that the affinity between TNF-and CHP was much stronger than that of IL-12 and CHP. It seems that TNF-trimers fit well in the inner space of the CHP complex. The molecular interactions of TNF-and CHP are a topic of further study for our group.

We examined the immune-enhancing activity of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles administered nasally. When administered the IVV, TNF/CHP nanoparticles induced high levels of IgA in the nasal wash, as well as IgG 1 in blood plasma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b) ). Furthermore, the antigen-specific antibody response was induced against influenza type B as well as type A/H1N1 and type A/H3N2, which consisted in the IVV used (Figure 2(c) ). It is suggested that nasal vaccination covers broad range of antigenicity as reported [3, 4] . The effects were comparable to those of CTB, which is recognized to be the most powerful vaccine adjuvant in experimental settings [31] . These data indicate that TNF/CHP nanoparticles administered nasally can induce not only mucosal but also systemic immunity significantly and efficiently. The stimulatory effects were seen with other antigens, such as Hepatitis virus type A vaccine and diphtheria toxoid (data not shown). These data suggest that TNF/CHP nanoparticles have the potential as a vaccine adjuvant with a broad range of applications.

TNF/CHP nanoparticles elicited immune activation comparable to that of CTB (Figure 3(a) ). ELISpot analysis indicated that the nanoparticles decreased IFN--producing cells and increased IL-4-producing cells (Figure 3(b) ). These data suggest that the nasally administered adjuvant shifted the Th1/Th2 balance to a Th2-dominant state and confirmed previous results with a mutant TNF- [15] . The effects of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed stronger than those of CTB.

To directly address the use of TNF/CHP nanoparticles as a vaccine adjuvant on protective immunity, we employed a lethal influenza challenge mouse model. The mice were immunized with influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008, followed by challenge with an antigenically distinct influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). The nasally administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles induced protective immunity in spite of the distinct antigenicities [32] , suggesting that they have a potential for inducing broad crossprotection ( Figure 4 ). Muraoka et al. proposed that CHPbased nanoparticles preferentially deliver the antigen to antigen-presenting cells in lymph nodes to potentiate effective immune responses [33] . This might be the reason why the TNF/CHP nanoparticles induced excellent protective immunity. They, however, reported that CHP itself did not show an adjuvant effect in the context of a tumor vaccine [25] . Interestingly, CHP only (without TNF-) showed a certain level of efficacy in our study. The reason for the discrepancy between their results and ours is not clear. It is unlikely that TNF-was replaced in vivo by IVV antigens to form IVV/CHP nanoparticles, which would then preferentially deliver vaccine antigens to the lymph node given the short time frame. Further, Oyewumi et al. reported that particle size was critical for adjuvant activity [34] . Because the DLS analyses showed no difference in particle size between the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and empty CHP particles (Figure 1 ), the size difference between them does not explain the discrepancy, either. Protection against external pathogens such as influenza virus and internal antigens such as tumor antigen might rely on different mechanisms. TNF/CHP nanoparticles enhanced an IgA response not only at the site of application (i.e., in the nasal wash) but also at distant mucosal sites, including vaginal and salivary glands (data not shown). IgA antibody elicited at the mucosa is of vital importance as the natural route of infection for influenza is via the respiratory mucosa. Hence, local mucosal protection against pharyngeal carriage is likely to be decisive for preventing disease [35] . Conventional parenteral vaccines are not able to stimulate mucosal immune responses, thus restricting their efficacy in infections of mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory tract [3] . Our nasal vaccine/adjuvant formulation consisting of the IVV and TNF/CHP nanoparticles effectively induced both systemic and mucosal protective immunity. Antibodies became detectable after the second or the third vaccination and reached plateau levels thereafter in mice vaccinated with TNF/CHP nanoparticles (data not shown). Also, the nanoparticles maintained immune responses for a long period of time, at least for 91 d (data not shown). These data indicate that nanoparticles induced long-lived immune memory, a critical feature for successful vaccine adjuvants.

The mucosal surfaces are known to have abundant B cells, T cells, and plasma (or DC) cells. After the repeated immunization of animals, activation of DC and B cells seemed enhanced in NALT tissue by TNF/CHP nanoparticles, despite being in small extents ( Figure 5 ). Uptake of antigen by the mucosal tissues is essential for the induction of immune responses [36] . Therefore, we examined antigen uptake by NALT-resident and nasal passage DCs, the inductive sites of common mucosal immune system (CMIS) [37] . TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed to stimulate NALT and the nasal passage DCs, in particular the latter more intensely ( Figure 6 ). Also, TNF/CHP nanoparticles enhanced expression of DC and B cell activation markers (CD40, CD80, and CD86) in bone marrow-derived immature DC preparation (data not shown). Considering a relatively large volume of the nasal administration (30 L/mouse) in this study, a possibility that TNF/CHP nanoparticles affect immune cells in the lower respiratory tract as well as nasal mucosa should be considered. We plan to explore the possibility in future studies.

Vaccine adjuvants trigger the innate immune system to enhance humoral and cellular responses to the coadministered vaccine antigens. To understand the mechanisms by which TNF/CHP nanoparticles activate innate immunity, we conducted gene expression profiling in NALT cells. The expression of genes related to inflammation and immunity was found to be upregulated (data not shown). Based on these results, we focused on the inflammatory signaling molecules and performed quantitative PCR analyses. Enhanced expression of IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-6, CXCL2, IL-12 , CD14, and LPS binding protein was found in TNF/CHP nanoparticleadministered mice. Free, exogenous TNF elicited strong and early increases in the expression of inflammatory signaling molecules. In comparison, the pattern was similar but the extent was less with TNF/CHP nanoparticles (Figure 7) . The nanoparticles might effect a slow release of TNF-, prolonging the immune-stimulatory effect. Taken together, TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed to protract activation of innate immunity. The nanoparticles might prolong the stimulatory effect of TNF-moderately and thereby provide the immune-enhancing adjuvant effect. Further, although expression of IL-12 was elicited in response to the CTB adjuvant, IL-12 was weakly elicited in the case of TNF/CHP nanoparticles. CHP seemed to minimize the unfavorable effects of TNF-while promoting its beneficial activities. One important issue related to the development of nasal vaccines is safety concerns about the potential dissemination of vaccine antigens to the central nervous system (CNS). Past reports suggested that nasal administration of CTB reached the CNS and accumulated in olfactory tissues. It caused Bell's Palsy in clinical studies, probably due to IL-12 production, and the use of CTB in humans was prohibited [38, 39] . In that context, lower expression level of IL-12 might be a beneficial safety feature of TNF/CHP nanoparticles.

Although CHP itself did not show immune-enhancing activity such as increasing IgG 1 and IgA or the expression of inflammation-related genes, it showed a certain level of protection in a lethal influenza virus challenge (Figure 4) . We cannot easily account for this observation. There are likely other pathways and mechanisms involved and waiting to be clarified.

Very recently, Onishi et al. reported that hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (HP--CD), another type of saccharidebased material that can form nanoparticles, exhibited adjuvant activity and elicited a strong protective effect against influenza virus in mice and cynomolgus macaques [40] . They suggested the involvement of Tfh cells via MyD88-and TBKdependent pathways. Their findings may shed some light on additional mechanisms at play with nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvants. However, they mentioned the cytotoxicity of HP--CD at more than 0.5% in vitro, probably because of -CD's ability to extract cholesterol out of cell membranes [41] . TNF/CHP nanoparticles might represent a preferable alternative.

Preliminary safety studies revealed no severe toxic findings resulting from the exposure to TNF/CHP nanoparticles. In the repeated toxicity study, slight-to-moderate infusion and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed at nasal mucosal tissue, the administration site. This response would likely be reversible over time. And enhancing effect of TNF/CHP nanoparticles in the case of repeated administration on induction of antigen-specific antibody in blood was confirmed again (Table 3) . Even through the careful histopathological examination, no abnormal finding in brain including olfactory bulb was noted, suggesting no obvious damage of the CNS. No obvious immunotoxicity was detected and the results suggested that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are relatively safe as a nasal vaccine adjuvant.

The results of this study demonstrate that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are effective as a vaccine adjuvant when administered via the nasal mucosal route. Moreover, the ability of TNF/CHP nanoparticles to stimulate comparatively balanced systemic as well as mucosal immune responses makes them a potentially promising vaccine adjuvant for inducing immunity against infectious pathogens. In the short term, TNF/CHP nanoparticles may provide a useful way for developing new nasal influenza vaccines. Further, we propose that combining TNF/CHP nanoparticles with nextgeneration vaccine platforms that do not rely on the cold chain will offer valuable alternatives for vaccination in a variety of settings.

viruses Antiviral Drug Discovery: Norovirus Proteases and Development of Inhibitors,"Proteases are a major enzyme group playing important roles in a wide variety of biological processes in life forms ranging from viruses to mammalians. The aberrant activity of proteases can lead to various diseases; consequently, host proteases have been the focus of intense investigation as potential therapeutic targets. A wide range of viruses encode proteases which play an essential role in viral replication and, therefore, constitute attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics. There are numerous examples of successful drug development targeting cellular and viral proteases, including antivirals against human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. Most FDA-approved antiviral agents are peptidomimetics and macrocyclic compounds that interact with the active site of a targeted protease. Norovirus proteases are cysteine proteases that contain a chymotrypsin-like fold in their 3D structures. This review focuses on our group's efforts related to the development of norovirus protease inhibitors as potential anti-norovirus therapeutics. These protease inhibitors are rationally designed transition-state inhibitors encompassing dipeptidyl, tripeptidyl and macrocyclic compounds. Highly effective inhibitors validated in X-ray co-crystallization, enzyme and cell-based assays, as well as an animal model, were generated by launching an optimization campaign utilizing the initial hit compounds. A prodrug approach was also explored to improve the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the identified inhibitors.","Proteases play an important role in the activation of precursor proteins to mature forms, the recycling of proteins, and other essential functions in the body (vide infra) [1] . They are classified into over 80 families based on evolutionary relationships [1] . The major protease classes based on catalytic types include serine, cysteine, aspartic, threonine, glutamic acid, and metalloproteases [1, 2] . Most proteases recognize specific sequences of amino acids in their substrates and cleave the peptide bond between the P 1 and P 1 ' residues ( Figure 1 ) [3] via nucleophilic attack of the side chain of a cysteine, serine or threonine residue, or a water molecule (aspartic, glutamic acid, and metalloproteases) on the amide carbon of the scissile bond [2] . Proteolysis of the scissile bond between P 1 and P 1 '. Standard nomenclature P 1 . . . P n and P 1 ' . . . P n ' for amino acid residues of the substrates. S 1 ... S n and S 1 ' . . . S n ' are the corresponding binding sites on the enzyme (per Berger and Schechter nomenclature (3)).

There are approximately 600 proteases (~2% of the genomes) encoded by the human genome. These are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes, including protein turnover, digestion, blood coagulation, wound healing, fertilization, cell differentiation and growth, cell signaling, the immune response, and apoptosis. However, uncontrolled, poorly regulated, or undesired proteolysis can lead to various diseases [4] . Examples of these include: (1) cancer (metastasis, angiogenesis): proteasome, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), caspases, and furin;

(2) neurological diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemia, central nerve system injury): a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), γ-secretase, β-secretase 1, and MMP-24; (3) inflammation (arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, diverticulitis, chronic liver disease): MMPs, cathepsins, neutrophil elastase, and ADAM17; (4) blood coagulation: thrombin, factor Xa; (5) diabetes: dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4); (6) cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, neovascularization and cardiac remodeling, cardiac fibrosis, aneurism, ischemia-reperfusion injury): angiotensin converting enzyme, renin, MMPs, chymase, neprilysin, calpain; (7) osteoporosis: cathepsin K; and (8) autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, lupus, Guillain-Barre syndrome, psoriasis): activated protein C, kallikreins; ageing (skin), MMPs, neutrophil elastase [1, 2] .

Since poorly-regulated proteases themselves can be detrimental, there are physiological protease inhibitors in the body which help to maintain a protease-protease inhibitor balance by controlling aberrant protease activity [5] [6] [7] . Well-known physiological protease inhibitors include the serpin superfamily, consisting of α-1-antitrypsin, α-1-antichymotrypsin, C1-inhibitor, antithrombin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and neuroserpin [6, 7] . Thus, natural or synthetic protease inhibitors have been studied and developed for various pathological conditions [4] and there are several FDA-approved drugs on the market. Currently, commercially available synthetic protease inhibitors targeting host proteases include (1) thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors for coagulation (such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban); (2) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension (such as lisinopril); (3) DPP-4 inhibitors for diabetes (such as sitagliptin); and (4) proteasome inhibitors for multiple myeloma (such as bortezomib) ( Figure 2 ). 

Certain viruses also encode viral proteases for successful infection of the hosts. The HIV aspartic and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3-4A serine protease are among the well-studied due to their significance in public health and successful antiviral drug development. Each HIV particle has two copies of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Upon infection of host cells, the HIV-1 genome is transcribed into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription, which is then integrated into the human genome. The HIV-1 virus utilizes the host cell machinery to replicate, producing virus particles. As viruses are released from host cells, they undergo maturation where viral structural polyproteins are cleaved by HIV-1 viral protease to produce infectious virus particles. The functional HIV protease is formed by two identical monomers of 99 amino acids. Each protease monomer contributes one catalytic aspartic acid (25 and 25' Asp) in the active site ( Figure 3A) , and the two conserved catalytic residues work together to process HIV-1 Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during viral maturation when new virus particles are released from cell membrane. The active site is covered by two flexible β-hairpin flaps ( Figure 3A ), which open to allow the substrates to enter the active site [8] . HIV-1 protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors at nine processing sites to produce mature proteins ( Figure 3B ) [8] . In general, a hydrophobic amino acid at P1 is required for efficient cleavage by HIV-1 protease, and the cleavage rates vary significantly based on the sequences in the P6 to P3' region [9, 10] .

Examples of commercially available protease inhibitors and their targets. Dabigatran and Rivaroxaban are anti-coagulants; Lisinopril is for hypertension; Sitagliptin is for diabetes; and Bortezomib is for multiple myeloma.

Since maturation of HIV-1 by viral protease is essential to produce infectious virus particles, HIV-1 protease has been the target of extensive drug discovery and development efforts. There are at least ten HIV protease inhibitors approved by the FDA, including saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and darunavir ( Figure 4 ) [11, 12] . These compounds are peptidomimetic inhibitors that target the active site, except for Tipranavir which binds to the flap region of the viral protease [11] . The strategies employed in targeting the viral protease active site utilize reduced small peptides (compounds with 3 to 5 peptidyl residues containing a hydrophobic residue at the P 1 position) with an isosteric replacement at the scissile bond which mimics the tetrahedral transition state of the proteolytic reaction [8] . Most commercially available drugs use a nonhydrolyzable hydroxyethylene or hydroxyethylamine moiety as the basic core [8] (Figure 4) . Other examples of noncleavable transition-state isosteres are statine, norstatine, phosphinate, reduced amide, dihydroxyethylene, α-keto amide and, more recently, silicon-based inhibitors [8] . The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of these commercially available inhibitors against HIV-1 in cell culture range from 1 to 100 nM ( Figure 4 ). To enhance the physicochemical and PK properties of protease inhibitors, a prodrug approach has also been utilized. For example, Fosamprenavir is the phosphate ester prodrug of amprenavir that contains a hydrolyzable ester bond. The phosphate prodrug displays improved cellular absorption and diminished side effects [13] . Additionally, protease inhibitors are used in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimes.

HCV is a single stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and its genome is approximately 9.6 kb, which is translated into a polyprotein of ~3000 amino acid residues.

HCV is a single stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and its genome is approximately 9.6 kb, which is translated into a polyprotein of~3000 amino acid residues. There are at least six distinct HCV genotypes (1 to 6) with genotype 1 accounting approximately 70 to 75% of all HCV infections in the US [14] . The polyprotein is processed by cellular and viral proteases to generate at least 10 mature structural and non-structural proteins. HCV encodes an NS2-3 autoprotease and a NS3-4A serine protease. NS2-3 protease autocleaves the NS2 and NS3 junction and NS3-4A serine protease is responsible for cleavage at four junctions on viral polyproteins (NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, and NS5A-NS5B junctions), as well as cellular proteins that are involved in innate immunity. NS3 is comprised of protease (N-terminal,~200 aa) and helicase domains (C-terminal), and forms a heterodimer with NS4A (54-residue protein) [15, 16] . NS4A binds to the N-terminal region of NS3 and acts as a cofactor of the protease to enhance cleavage [15, 16] . NS3 forms a trypsin-like fold with two β-barrels and contains the catalytic triad residues (His57, Asp81 and Ser139) in the active site ( Figure 5 ). The cleavage sites by NS3-4A protease on the polyprotein are listed in Figure 5 [17] . The P 1 residue is accommodated in the S 1 pocket in the NS3-4A protease, and other residues flanking the pocket are important determinants of substrate recognition. The S 1 pocket of NS3 protease prefers small, hydrophobic residues (such as cysteine) at the P 1 position of its substrates [17] . HCV NS3-4A is known to have a shallow binding pocket requiring an extended subtrate spanning 10 amino acid residues (P 6 to P 4 ') for efficient enzyme activity. The consensus sequence for P 6 to P 1 ' is (D/E)XXXX(C/T)(A/S) for all trans-cleavage sites, with X being any amino acid. Commercially available HCV protease inhibitors include Telaprevir (Incivek) [18] , Boceprevir (Victrelis) [19] , Simeprevir, Grazoprevir, Voxilaprevir, Paritaprevir, and Glecaprevir [20] (Figure 6 ). These inhibitors are often used as part of combination therapy with other inhibitors, such as polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. The macrocyclic compounds, shown in Figure 6 , display Commercially available HCV protease inhibitors include Telaprevir (Incivek) [18] , Boceprevir (Victrelis) [19] , Simeprevir, Grazoprevir, Voxilaprevir, Paritaprevir, and Glecaprevir [20] (Figure 6 ). These inhibitors are often used as part of combination therapy with other inhibitors, such as polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. The macrocyclic compounds, shown in Figure 6 , display significantly improved EC 50 values over Telaprevir and Boceprevir, the first-generation protease inhibitors [20] (Figure 6 ). Both Boceptrevir and Telatrevir contain an α-ketoamide warhead, a small residue at the P 1 position, and a Pro or Pro surrogate at the P 2 position [18, 19] (Figure 6 ). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies with HCV protease inhibitors have demonstrated a preference for residues with small hydrophobic side chains such as ethyl, propyl and trifluoroethyl at the P 1 position and bulky substituents at the P 2 position for increased efficency. SAR studies utilizing different warhead groups in protease inhibitors have shown that an α-ketoamide warhead is preferred, resulting in up to a 40-fold improvement in binding affinity over the aldehyde counterpart [21] . Other warheads, such as trifluoromethyl or chloromethyl ketones, were found to be less effective [20] . The EC 50 values of these protease inhibitors ranged from 100 to 300 nM for Telatrevir and Boceprevir, and from 0.2 to 15 nM for the macrocyclic compounds in HCV replicon harboring cells, dependent on the virus genotypes used ( Figure 6 ). 

Human noroviruses causing acute gastroenteritis belong to two major genogroups (GI and GII) comprised of at least 28 genotypes associated with human disease [22] . As a GI strain, Norwalk virus (NV) is the first known norovirus, and serves as a prototype strain [23] . Currently, the GII genogroup viruses are more prevalent, and GII.4 and newly emerging GII.17 strains are primarily responsible for most infections and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis [24, 25] . Outbreaks occur frequently in hospitals, nursing homes, navy and cruise ships, and schools, and they are difficult to control due to the highly contagious and genetically diverse nature of noroviruses, as well as their prolonged shedding and high stability in the environment [3, 26] . The most common routes of virus transmission are fecal-oral, food-or waterborne, aerosol and person-to-person [23, 27] . The vomiting and diarrhea associated with norovirus infection is incapacitating but self-limiting among healthy adults. However, morbidity is high in immunocompromised individuals, young children, and the elderly [28, 29] . The significant impact of noroviruses on public health and potential bioterrorism threat underscores the need for norovirus-specific small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics.

The genome of noroviruses contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that consists of three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode a 200 kDa polyprotein (ORF1), a major capsid protein VP1 (ORF2), and a small basic protein VP2 (ORF3) [23] . The polyprotein is processed by a virus-encoded 3C-like cysteine protease (3CL Pro ) to generate mature non-structural proteins. Norovirus 3CL Pro forms a typical chymotrypsin-like fold and contains the catalytic residues of Cys139, His30 and Glu54 in the active site ( Figure 7A ). Noroviruses are classified into seven genogroups (GI-GVII) [23, 25] . However, the active sites of norovirus 3CL Pro from diverse noroviruses and related caliciviruses, as well as coronaviruses (3C-like proteases) and picornaviruses (3C proteases), are well-conserved [30] . 

Human noroviruses causing acute gastroenteritis belong to two major genogroups (GI and GII) comprised of at least 28 genotypes associated with human disease [22] . As a GI strain, Norwalk virus (NV) is the first known norovirus, and serves as a prototype strain [23] . Currently, the GII genogroup viruses are more prevalent, and GII.4 and newly emerging GII.17 strains are primarily responsible for most infections and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis [24, 25] . Outbreaks occur frequently in hospitals, nursing homes, navy and cruise ships, and schools, and they are difficult to control due to the highly contagious and genetically diverse nature of noroviruses, as well as their prolonged shedding and high stability in the environment [3, 26] . The most common routes of virus transmission are fecal-oral, food-or waterborne, aerosol and person-to-person [23, 27] . The vomiting and diarrhea associated with norovirus infection is incapacitating but self-limiting among healthy adults. However, morbidity is high in immunocompromised individuals, young children, and the elderly [28, 29] . The significant impact of noroviruses on public health and potential bioterrorism threat underscores the need for norovirus-specific small molecule therapeutics and prophylactics. The genome of noroviruses contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that consists of three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode a 200 kDa polyprotein (ORF1), a major capsid protein VP1 (ORF2), and a small basic protein VP2 (ORF3) [23] . The polyprotein is processed by a virus-encoded 3C-like cysteine protease (3CL Pro ) to generate mature non-structural proteins. Norovirus 3CL Pro forms a typical chymotrypsin-like fold and contains the catalytic residues of Cys139, His30 and Glu54 in the active site ( Figure 7A ). Noroviruses are classified into seven genogroups (GI-GVII) [23, 25] . However, the active sites of norovirus 3CL Pro from diverse noroviruses and related caliciviruses, as well as coronaviruses (3C-like proteases) and picornaviruses (3C proteases), are well-conserved [30] . The mechanism of action of norovirus 3CL Pro is similar to that established for related cysteine proteases where Cys139 acts as a nucleophile, His30 functions as a general acid/base, and Glu54 facilitates the alignment of His30 and promotes deprotonation of Cys139. The oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by the presence of an oxyanion hole adjacent to the norovirus 3CL Pro active site. The substrate specificity of norovirus 3CL Pro shows a strong preference for a D/E-F-X-L-Q-G-P sequence (where X is H, Q or V), corresponding to the subsites S 5 -S 4 -S 3 -S 2 -S 1 -S 1 '-S 2 ' (Figure 7B ). 

The general strategy employed in the design of norovirus 3CL Pro inhibitors involved the construction of transition-state (TS) inhibitors or TS mimics (Figure 8 ). We have synthesized dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compounds containing a glutamine surrogate at the P1 position with numerous variations at the P2 and/or P3 positions. The efficacy of each inhibitor was evaluated using norovirus 3CL Pro from GI (Norwalk virus, NV), GII (MD145) and GV (murine norovirus-1, MNV-1), as well as cell-based assays with NV replicon harboring cells [31] and MNV-1 [32] . The antiviral effects of each inhibitor were also evaluated using feline calicivirus in cell culture to assess their ability to inhibit diverse noroviruses and caliciviruses [30] . The inclusion of a glutamine surrogate at the P1 position was found by us, and others, to be crucial for efficient inhibitory activity. An array of warheads (the reactive residue that interacts with the catalytic Cys139) was employed in the synthesis of inhibitors, including aldehyde, α-ketoamide, α-ketoester, nitrile, and α-ketoheterocycle moieties [33, 34] . Moreover, TS mimics such as α-hydroxyphosphonates and α-hydroxyesters, were also

Moreover, TS mimics such as α-hydroxyphosphonates and α-hydroxyesters, were also investigated [35] . The synthesized inhibitors were examined for inhibitory activity in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protease assay using norovirus 3CL Pro from GI and GII strains [36] , NV replicon harboring cells [31] , and against MNV-1 in RAW267.4 cells [32] . These studies showed that although most of these warheads were active against norovirus 3CL Pro , the aldehyde warhead displayed superior activity (>3-5 fold) compared to other warheads. The high chemical reactivity of aldehyde warheads employed in the design of TS inhibitors is occasionally associated with a lack of selectivity, as well as off-target effects. Therefore, a latent aldehyde warhead, such as an aldehyde bisulfite adduct, which reverts to the precursor aldehyde under physiological conditions was utilized [37] . The pharmacological activity of the bisulfite adducts of peptidyl aldehydes was shown to be comparable to those of the precursor aldehydes [37] .

revealed that a large conformational change occurs in a nearby active site loop to accommodate inhibitor binding [30] . These structures served as a guide for further development of potent dipeptidyl inhibitors. Using GC373 as a starting point [33] , optimization of R1 (accommodated in the S2 pocket) and R2 (accommodated in the S4 pocket) was conducted (Figure 8 ) [38] . The FRET assay using 3CL Pro of GI and GII noroviruses (IC50) and cell based assays (EC50) using NV replicon harboring cells revealed that replacing Leu at R2 with cyclohexylalanine (Cha) (GC543) increased potency significantly (IC50 600 nM to 300 nM and EC50 200 nM to 60 nM) (Figure 8 ) [38] , while the substitution of R2 with a m-Cl substituent further increased potency (IC50 100 nM and EC50 20 nM) (GC583) [38] . Co-crystal structures with each compound revealed the structural determinants that are responsible for the increase in potency (Figures 9): 1 ) a more extensive hydrogen bonding network is present relative to GC373; 2) the cyclohexyl ring is positioned tightly, optimally filling the hydrophobic S2 subsite of NV Pro; and 3) the m-chlorophenyl ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket near Ile109 and Val168 [38] . The EC50 values against MNV-1 were also found to be well correlated with the EC50 values in NV replicon harboring cells (HG23 cells): 3.5 µM, 0.6 µM, 0.08 µM for GC373, GC543 and GC583, respectively [38] . Additionally, SAR studies were performed to probe the hydrophobic S4 pocket of norovirus 3CL Pro and exploit favorable hydrophobic binding interactions [39] . Specifically, because the m-Cl benzyl moiety in GC583 projects toward the S4 subsite of the protease (Figure 9 ), its close proximity to a string of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala158, Ala160, Val168 and Ile109) was exploited through appropriate cap modifications, including the use of sulfonamide and lipid moieties [39] . The synthesized compounds displayed high potency in inhibiting norovirus replication in cells (EC50 up to 0.1 µM in replication in NV harboring cells or MNV-1) but did not increase the potency over GC583 [39] .

The prodrug approach has been highly successful in improving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)/PK characteristics of HIV and HCV protease inhibitors. Our group utilized aldehyde bisulfite adduct inhibitors to synthesize ester and carbamate prodrugs to improve their PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties [26] . The generated prodrugs were found to have comparable efficacy to their precursors, and exhibited lower or low cytotoxicity, increased stability in liver microsomes and reduced plasma protein binding, demonstrating the soundness of the prodrug approach in the development of NV 3CL Pro therapeutics, as well as its general applicability to other viral serine and cysteine proteases of medical relevance [26] . For the dipeptidyl inhibitors against norovirus 3CL pro , the hydroxyl group in bisulfite adducts provided a convenient site for further derivatization to yield ester and carbamate prodrugs [26] . Enzyme-mediated or nonenzymatic hydrolysis converts prodrugs into the aldehyde bisulfite adduct, which subsequently reverts to the precursor aldehyde [26] .

Macrocyclic compounds frequently display good pharmacological activity and selectivity, enhanced permeability, and improved metabolic stability; consequently, there has been an intense interest in macrocyclic inhibitors and their utilization in drug discovery and development. The design rationale of macrocyclic norovirus 3CL Pro inhibitors entailed the following considerations: firstly, proteases are known to recognize their ligands in the β-strand conformation [40] ; therefore, macrocyclization is an effective way of pre-organizing a peptidyl transition-state mimic in a β-strand conformation suitable for binding to the active site of a protease [41] . This invariably increases affinity by reducing the loss of entropy upon inhibitor binding. Secondly, macrocyclization increases cellular permeability, particularly when the design includes the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, as well as proteolytic stability [42] . Thus, macrocyclization generally enhances drug-like characteristics [43] . For norovirus 3CL Pro , the plasticity of the S 3 subsite allows the design of macrocyclic inhibitors by tethering the P 1 Gln side chain to the P 3 residue side chain. Based on these considerations, our group synthesized and evaluated for the first time a series of novel classes of macrocyclic compounds for their antiviral effects against noroviruses ( Figure 10 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . These include (1) triazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors [45] ; (2) oxadiazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors [47] ; and (3) macrocyclic inhibitors incorporating a methylene linker [46] (Figure 10 ). These non-optimized macrocyclic compounds were found to be cell permeable and displayed moderate inhibitory activity against NV 3CL Pro and viral replication in cells [44] [45] [46] [47] . Their EC 50 ranged between 2 to 100 µM in NV replicon harboring cells [44] [45] [46] [47] . X-ray co-crystallization with the macrocyclic compounds showed that, in some of the compounds, the number of hydrogen bonds between NV 3CL Pro and the inhibitors decreased in comparison with the non-macrocyclic dipeptidyl compounds arising from a major structural reorganization of the active site ( Figure 10 ). Pharmacological activity and cellular permeability were found to be dependent on the interplay of several factors, including the ring size, type of linker, and other structural determinants. considerations, our group synthesized and evaluated for the first time a series of novel classes of macrocyclic compounds for their antiviral effects against noroviruses ( Figure 10 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] .

Our group reported for the first time that Rupintrivir, an enterovirus 3C protease inhibitor, was also effective against norovirus replication [30] . Rupintrivir is a tripeptidyl compound possessing an α, β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor) as a warhead which inactivates norovirus 3CL Pro irreversibly, presumably through a Michael addition reaction with Cys139 [48] . Several tripeptidyl compounds were synthesized with a glutamine surrogate at the P1 position and their effects on norovirus in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and cell-based assays were examined

Rupintrivir is a tripeptidyl compound possessing an α, β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor) as a warhead which inactivates norovirus 3CL Pro irreversibly, presumably through a Michael addition reaction with Cys139 [48] . Several tripeptidyl compounds were synthesized with a glutamine surrogate at the P 1 position and their effects on norovirus in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and cell-based assays were examined [49] . SAR studies with the tripeptidyl series of compounds showed that, like dipeptidyl inhibitors, a cyclohexyl alanine at the P 2 position increased potency [49] . In addition, the cellular permeability of the tripeptidyl compounds was dependent on the nature of the residue at the P 3 position. Compounds with a hydrophobic residue at P 3 (such as naphthyl alanine and Phe) were highly effective in the FRET and cell-based assays (the best compound was NPI52 with an EC 50 of 0.04 µM in the replicon harboring cells). Detailed structures and the efficacy of the tripeptidyl compound series are reported in our prior report [49] . Similar tripeptidyl compounds with acyclic amides [50] or a 6-membered lactam ring [51] at the P 1 position were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-norovirus effects. However, their efficacy was lower than that of NPI52 in enzyme-or cell-based assays [49] [50] [51] .

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by a virulent feline coronavirus and is highly fatal (100% fatality). In cats with FIP, granulomatous vasculitis and granuloma lesions composed mainly of virus-infected macrophages are found in various organs, leading to clinical signs, which may include characteristic bodily effusions. The absolute lymphopenia, a prominent feature of both experimental and natural infection of FIP, is associated with the massive apoptosis of uninfected T-cells and its appearance precedes clinical signs typical of FIP. Due to the conservation of 3C proteases from picornaviruses, and 3CL pro from caliciviruses and picornaviruses, most dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compound series were also effective against multiple viruses in these families [30] . Since GC376 (bisulfite adduct of corresponding aldehyde GC373) potently inhibits feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cell culture (EC 50 0.04 µM with FIPV 1146 strain) [52] , we determined the efficacy of GC376 against FIP in cats as a proof-of-concept study using experimentally-infected pathogen-free (SPF) cats and client-owned cats with natural infection with FIPV [53, 54] . These studies have demonstrated that (1) GC376 was well tolerated in the animals with up to 4-week continual treatments and (2) for the first time, drug-like small-molecule inhibitors (GC376-like molecules) of coronaviruses and noroviruses can serve as potential antiviral therapeutics.

Proteases are proven therapeutic targets for antivirals. Our group has been working on the development of protease inhibitors against noroviruses for the past several years. These are rationally designed transition-state inhibitors consisting of dipeptidyl, tripeptidyl and macrocyclic compounds. These highly effective inhibitors, validated by X-ray co-crystallization, enzyme and cell-based assays, as well as an animal model, were generated by an optimization campaign utilizing the initial hit compounds. These findings warrant further development of the cited series of compounds beyond preclinical testing.

Antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections,"Antibodies are an important component in host immune responses to viral pathogens. Because of their unique maturation process, antibodies can evolve to be highly specific to viral antigens. Physicians and researchers have been relying on such high specificity in their quest to understand host-viral interaction and viral pathogenesis mechanisms and to find potential cures for viral infection and disease. With more than 60 recombinant monoclonal antibodies developed for human use in the last 20 years, monoclonal antibodies are now considered a viable therapeutic modality for infectious disease targets, including newly emerging viral pathogens such as Ebola representing heightened public health concerns, as well as pathogens that have long been known, such as human cytomegalovirus. Here, we summarize some recent advances in identification and characterization of monoclonal antibodies suitable as drug candidates for clinical evaluation, and review some promising candidates in the development pipeline.","The earliest application of antibodies as a treatment for viral infections can be traced back to the early 20th century, use of sera from infected humans who had recovered from the same infection. 1, 2 This crude treatment regimen, serum therapy, was gradually replaced by antibodies purified from pooled sera, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). 3 Despite the success of both serum therapy and IVIG, no significant progress was made in the generation of antibodies as therapies until the hybridoma method was developed, enabling isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from immunized mice in 1975. 4 Since the mid-1980s, several methods have been developed for the efficient isolation of mAbs against viruses from human and animal sources. One method involves using an antigen to pan antibody libraries constructed from immunoglobulin V H and V L variable regions genes of non-immune, vaccinated, or naturally infected individuals. In this method, antibody libraries are presented to antigens by display, for instance on phage, 5, 6 bacteria, 7 yeast, 8 or mammalian cells. 9 In other methods, antibodies are cloned from single-memory B cells [10] [11] [12] [13] or plasma B cells [14] [15] [16] isolated from vaccinated or naturally infected animals and human donors. mAbs have also been generated from immune sera using an approach that combines proteomics and reverse genetics. 17, 18 More recently, heavy and light chain paired mAbs have been generated by deep sequencing of the B-cell IgG repertoire. 19, 20 This review focuses on approaches to generate therapeutic mAbs to fight viral infection, examples of mAb therapies for viral infections, and the challenges of developing such therapies.

Phage displayed antibody libraries. mAbs can be isolated from immunized or infected humans or animals using a library of displayed antibodies (Fig. 1) . Genes encoding the antibody heavy and light chains from B cells of immunized or infected humans or animals are cloned as Fab or scFv fragments and displayed, for instance on filamentous phage. Virus-specific antibodies are isolated by panning the libraries against antigens. This approach has been used to isolate potent neutralizing antibodies from the B cells of rhesus macaques immunized with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus 6 and from human IgM + memory B cells of recent seasonal influenza vaccines. 5 In addition to panning libraries constructed from antibody repertoires following infection, panning of native antibody libraries has yielded potent neutralizing antibodies against viral infections. For example, a broadly neutralizing HIV antibody (D5) was isolated from panning a native antibody library. 21 It might be difficult to identify highly neutralizing antibodies when panning against native phage libraries, because of the lack of antibody somatic hypermutation process. This disadvantage may be overcome by an in vitro affinity maturation step or by panning of libraries constructed from immunized or infected human or animal donors in which antibody somatic hypermutations took place against a given virus. While phage display is an efficient way to generate viral neutralizing antibodies from immunized, or infected, or non-immune humans or animals, the resulting antibodies do not necessarily represent the natural antibody repertoire, since the antibody fragments are generated from the random paring of IgG heavy and light variable regions. 22 Further, since a predefined and well-characterized antigen is required to pan the library, the approach is not suitable to identify new neutralizing epitopes of viral pathogens. 22 Single-memory B cells. The ability to clone antibody encoding genes from single B cells of naturally infected or immunized individuals is a significant advance in isolating anti-viral mAbs. Three different approaches have been developed for the isolation of mAbs from single-memory B cells (Fig. 2) . One approach involves isolating memory B cells specific for viral antigens by flow cytometry, followed by direct cloning of the antibody-encoding genes without culturing of the B cells. This approach has been applied to isolate neutralizing antibodies from naturally infected and immunized human donors for Zika, 23 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 24 HIV, 12 and HPV. 25 Antibodies were also isolated through this method from antigen-specific individual memory B cells of rhesus macaques immunized with gp140-F trimers based on the HIV-1 YU2 isolate. 26 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of generation of mAbs using phage display. This method has the advantage of being relatively easy with the potential to generate VH and VL combinations not found in nature. The diagram was generated based on a combination of publications 6, 21 Fig. 2 Schematic of isolation of mAbs from memory B cells. When these cells producing antibodies with desired characteristics can be found, a supply of these antibodies can be maintained by culture and cloning, immortalization, or direct cloning. The diagram was generated by summarizing multiple published papers. The diagram was generated based on a combination of publications [10] [11] [12] [13] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Since predefined antigens are required to identify the memory B cells then isolated by flow cytometry sorting, the abovementioned approach is not suitable for identification of novel neutralizing targets. To identify novel target epitopes, first, a large number of memory B cells are cultured, and then, the culture supernatant is screened against various antigens. This approach has been used for the discovery of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV and the discovery of a new HIV-1 vaccine target. 11 In this work, 11 surface IgG-expressing memory B cells were enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a HIV-1 infected donor by negative depletion with antibodies to CD3, CD14, CD16, IgM, IgA, IgD on magnetic beads. Individual memory B cells were then seeded in microtiterplates in the presence of feeder cells and conditioned media generated from mitogen-stimulated human T cells from healthy donors. The supernatants were collected 8 days later and screened for antigenbinding reactivity. In another protocol, the addition of cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-21, and irradiated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells can successfully stimulate memory B cells to produce high concentrations of IgG in the supernatant in 2 weeks. 10 In a third approach, B cells are immortalized by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in the presence of a toll-like receptor. This approach has been applied to the isolation of neutralizing antibodies against rabies, SARS-CoV, and other viruses. 13, 22, 27 Single-antibody-secreting plasma B cells. It has been reported that antigen-specific plasma cells account for up to 40-90% of total IgG-secreting cells in peripheral blood one week after boost immunization. 28 Methods for cloning IgG from human antibodysecreting cells have been developed (Fig. 3) . 15, [29] [30] [31] [32] This approach has been applied for isolating neutralizing antibodies from naturally infected and immunized human donors for dengue 33 and H1N1 influenza. 15, 34 Protocols for cloning mAbs from nonhuman primate plasma and memory B cells have also been reported. 16, 35, 36 In one report, a large panel of dengue targeting mAbs were cloned from single-antibody-secreting B cells of a rhesus macaque immunized with an experimental vaccine. 16 Single-antibody-secreting B cells were identified and isolated by flow cytometry, using a panel of phenotype markers. 16 To interrogate a large number of plasma B cells, a method was developed using microwell array chips. This method enables the analysis of live cells on a single-cell basis and offers rapid, efficient, and high-throughput (up to 234,000 individual cells) identification of antibody-secreting plasma cells. 37 In addition to direct cloning of antibody encoding genes from plasma B cells, single plasma cells can also be cultured on a monolayer of immortalized stromal cells or with IL-6 stimulation; the cultured cells would be able to produce enough antibody for screening assays of parallel viral binding and neutralization for identifying rare antibodies. 29 Proteomics-directed cloning of mAbs from serum. Antibodies cloned from single memory or plasma B cells represent the genetic antibody repertoire of an individual at a given time in response to a specific viral infection. However, this repertoire does not necessarily correspond to that of the antibodies present in circulation. Protocols have been developed to identify antigenspecific antibody sequences directly from circulating polyclonal antibodies in the sera of immunized or naturally infected animals or humans (Fig. 4) . These protocols combine the power of proteomics and next-generation sequencing (NGS). 17, 18, 38, 39 The approach involves affinity purification of antibodies with antigen specificity followed by analysis of proteolytically digested antibody fractions by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Peptide spectral matches of antibody variable regions are obtained by searching a reference database created by NGS of the B-cell immunoglobulin repertoire of the immunized animal or human. Finally, heavy and light chain sequences are paired and expressed as recombinant mAbs. 17, 18, 38 Using this approach, mAbs targeting HBV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were cloned from human donors. 38 This approach provides an alternative method to isolate potent viral neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic purposes. Further, it promotes a deeper understanding of the humoral response.

Deep sequencing of paired antibodies encoding genes from B cells. While cloning mAbs from individual memory or plasma B cells is a robust and efficient approach to isolate viral-specific antibodies, the approach provides only a snapshot and sample of the antibody genetic repertoire of an individual at a given time against a particular virus. Various deep-sequencing approaches can provide an unbiased picture of the B-cell repertoire based on either its heavy chain or light chain information, but the endogenous pairing of heavy and light chain is lost after bulk lysis of B-cell populations. 40 Phylogenetic matching of heavy and light chains from antibody deep-sequencing data can provide an approximation of natural heavy and light chain pairing. 41 Highthroughput sequencing of paired heavy and light chain variable Fig. 3 Overview of isolation, culture, and antibody gene cloning from plasma B cells. This method can be an efficient way of generating antibodies with desired specificity given the right antigen bait and timing. The diagram was generated based on a combination of publications 15, 16, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] regions at the single-cell level has proven technically challenging. A method that allows the determination of a paired heavy and light chain variable region repertoire from millions of cells with high precision was recently reported. 19, 20, 42 Briefly, flow-focusing is used to encapsulate single cells in emulsions containing magnetic beads for messenger RNA (mRNA) capture. The mRNA transcripts are then reverse-transcribed, physically linked to their partners by overlap extension PCR, and interrogated by highthroughput paired-end sequencing. 19 Once adapted widely by the research community, this method will provide powerful information on antibody response to infection and vaccination, vaccine efficacy, and the cloning of potent viral neutralizing antibodies. 42 mAbs targeting viral infections Table 1 shows mAbs in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of infectious viral diseases. These mAbs have been isolated from a variety of non-immune and immune sources, human and animal donors, using the range of strategies for generation of therapeutic antibodies introduced above.

Human cytomegalovirus. HCMV is a member of the herpes family. Like other members of this family, HCMV can establish lifelong latent infection in its host, with occasional reactivation. 43 Infection is in general asymptomatic, but can cause serious disease in people whose immune systems are compromised, such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients with HIV infection. Furthermore, children infected with HCMV in utero are at risk for serious birth defects. They may even experience delayed hearing loss and deafness despite being asymptomatic at birth. 43 After several decades of effort, an effective vaccine against HCMV infection remains elusive. 44 Typical adult therapy for HCMV infection is with antivirals such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. 45 For children who are suspected to have been infected in utero, treatment with Ganciclovir may prevent developmental problems and loss of hearing. 46 Women with primary infection during pregnancy, a risk factor for congenital HCMV infection and disease (cHCMV), may be treated with HCMV immunoglobulin as a way to reduce the cHCMV risk. 47 Polyclonal preparations of antibodies (IVIGs) are an alternative for antiviral medications that have serious limitations. For example, IVIGs are difficult to standardize and less effective. In contrast, mAbs specifically targeting key epitopes should provide an advantage in efficacy. Multiple HCMV targeting mAbs being developed are in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials. 48, 49 HCMV is a complex virus with multiple antigens, including glycoprotein B (gB) and the gHp entameric complex. 43, 50 The vast majority of antibodies generated against HCMV target its gB antigen. The gB targeting antibodies alone may not have strong neutralizing ability to control HCMV infection and reactivation. 51 Recent studies have demonstrated that the pentameric gH complex is the primary target for neutralizing antiviral antibodies, 50 and as result most recently developed mAbs target the virus' pentameric complex. 51 The use of a combination of mAbs has several advantages, including enhanced efficacy and decreased development of viral resistance. At least two of the HCMV targeting antibodies in clinical trials are combinations of two mAbs. 48, 49 CSJ148: CSJ148 is a combination of two anti-HCMV human mAbs -LJP538, which binds to the viral gB protein and LJP539, which binds to the viral gH pentameric complex. 48 LJP538, also known as 7H3, and LJP539, as 4I22, were isolated from EBV immortalized B cells from HCMV-immune human donors as described. 52, 53 Results from clinical trials show CSJ148 and its component mAbs were safe and well tolerated, with pharmacokinetics as expected for human immunoglobulin. 48 Phase 2 clinical trials of CSJ148 in stem cell transplant patients are ongoing. 54 RG7667: RG7667 is a combination of two mAbs, MCMV5322A and MCMV3068A. 49 MCMV5322A is an affinity-matured version of MSL-109 that binds a neutralizing epitope on HCMVgH/gL. 55 MSL-109 is a human mAb isolated from spleen cells of a HCMV seropositive individual. In the late 1990s, MSL-109, known by several other names including Protovir, SDZ 89-109, SDZ MSL-109, and Sevirumab, was developed by Sandoz in several clinical trials as a therapy for HCMV infection. 56 Development was discontinued after MSL-109 failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in the treatment of HCMV retinitis in AIDS patients and prevention of HCMV infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 56 In addition to the activities in developing MSL-109 as a therapy, the antibody was a subject for a series of mechanistic studies, Fig. 4 Representation of the combination of proteomics and high-throughput sequencing approaches to isolation of relevant mAbs from human donors. Analysis of nucleic acids from B cells combined with proteomic analysis of antibodies in serum provides a deeper understanding of the humoral response to viral infection and vaccinations. The diagram was generated based on a combination of publications 17, 18, 38, 39 including some that defined the mechanism by which HCMV escapes neutralization by MSL-109 57 . The other component of RG7667, MCMV3068A, binds the pentameric gH complex. MCMV3068A was isolated from a mouse hybridoma and subsequently humanized. 49 RG7667 is developed by Genentech as a treatment to prevent HCMV infection in utero and in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Phase 1 studies of RG7667 showed to be safe and well-tolerated and had a favorable pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profile. The study supports further development of RG7667 as a therapy for the prevention and treatment of HCMV infection in susceptible populations. 49 In a Phase 2 trial in high-risk kidney transplant recipients, RG7667 was well tolerated, numerically reduced the incidence of HCMV infection within 12 and 24 weeks post-transplantation; it was statistically significant for delaying time to HCMV viremia, and was associated with few cases of HCMV disease compared to placebo. 58 Influenza. Influenza virus infections are common and usually cause only mild illness. Typical therapy involves respiratory precautions and medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), that inhibit the influenza protein neuraminidase involved in release of virus particles. However, development of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors is a problem. 59 Influenza viruses have a unique flexibility which tolerates small errors, resulting in a change of viral structure known as ""antigenic drift"" that allows escape of the immune response. 60 The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be most common during the upcoming season. However, the vaccine is not always effective, due to mismatch of the predicted strains with the actual circulating flu strains. A universal flu vaccine with long-term effectiveness remains elusive. 61 Occasionally influenza virus makes a major change that preserves its virulence, as in the case of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. 34 The large antigenic drift renders the seasonal flu vaccine of little efficacy. As a result of the rapid development of antibody isolation and engineering technologies, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies is becoming an increasingly viable approach to address the immediate health threat of an influenza pandemic while vaccines are being developed. MHAA4549A: MAb MHAA4549A, also known as 39.29, was cloned from a single-human plasmablast cell isolated from an influenza vaccinated donor. MHAA4549A binds a highly conserved epitope on the stalk of influenza A HA and blocks the HAmediated membrane fusion in the endosome, and is capable of neutralizing all known human influenza A strains. 62 In two Phase 1 clinical trials, MHAA4549A was safe and well tolerated up to a single intravenous dose of 10,800 mg. The mAb demonstrates linear serum pharmacokinetics consistent with those of a human IgG1 antibody lacking known endogenous targets in humans. 63 MHAA4549A is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza A infection. 64, 65 VIS410: VIS410 is an engineered human IgG1mAb, which targets the stem (or stalk) region of influenza A HA and has demonstrated binding to both group 1 and group 2 HAs of influenza A viruses. 66 Prophylactic administration of VIS410 resulted in the complete protection of mice from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome against lethal influenza A (H7N9) virus challenge. 67 In a Phase 1 clinical trial, VIS410 was safe and well tolerated and had good relative exposure in both serum and upper respiratory tract. These results support its use as either a single-dose therapeutic or prophylactic for influenza A. 68 VIS410 is currently in a Phase 2a study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the antibody in subjects with uncomplicated influenza. 69 CR6261: Isolated from combinatorial display libraries that were constructed from human IgM( + ) memory B cells of seasonal influenza vaccinees, antibody CR6261 neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The antibody is protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge. 5 CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membraneproximal stem of HA1 and HA2. The antibody neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. 70 CR6261 is currently in Phase 2 clinical testing. 71 CR8020: The human mAb CR8020 has broad neutralizing activity against most group 2 viruses, including H3N2 and H7N7, which cause severe human infection. CR8020 was isolated from a B cell of a donor vaccinated against influenza. 72 The crystal structure of Fab CR8020 with the 1968 pandemic H3 HA reveals a highly conserved epitope in the HA stalk distinct from the epitope recognized by the V(H)1-69 group 1 antibodies. 72 CR8020 has been tested in Phase 1/2trials. 73 Structural and computational analyses indicate that CR8020 targets HA residues that are prone to antigenic drift and host selection pressure. Critically, CR8020 escape mutation was seen in certain H7N9 viruses from recent outbreaks. 74 TCN-032: Antibody TCN-032 was isolated from ab IgG( + ) memory B cell of a healthy human subject. The antibody recognizes a previously unknown conformational epitope within the ectodomain of the influenza matrix 2 protein, M2e. 75 This antibody-binding region is highly conserved in influenza A viruses. The region is present in nearly all strains detected to date, including highly pathogenic viruses that infect primarily birds and swine and the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 pandemic strain (S-OIV). In addition, TCN-032 protected mice from lethal challenges with either H5N1 or H1N1 influenza viruses. 75 A Phase 1 clinical study showed that TCN-032 was safe, with no evidence of immune exacerbation based on serum cytokine expression. The trial also showed that the antibody may provide immediate immunity and therapeutic benefit in influenza A infection, with no apparent emergence of resistant virus. 76 Human immunodeficiency virus. Despite decades of intensive effort, an effective HIV vaccine remains a challenge. With recent advances in the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies from single memory B cells of infected individuals, anti-HIV antibodies are becoming a viable approach for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. 77 A number of broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies are currently in clinical development to assess their therapeutic benefit in passive immunization. Most of the HIV mAbs in clinical testing, for instance VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074, and 4E10, are broadly neutralizing on the basis of targeting conserved viral epitopes. 78 PRO 140 is an antibody used to treat HIV targeting host CCR5, which often acts with CD4 as a co-receptor for the virus. 79 Many excellent reviews provide more detail on broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. 77, [80] [81] [82] Here we highlight some examples of HIV targeting antibodies in clinical development. VRC01: VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 mAb isolated from the B cells of an HIV-infected patient. 40, 83 It is directed against the HIV-1 CD4-binding site and is capable of potently neutralizing diverse HIV-1 strains. 84 A Phase 1 study showed that the antibody was safe and demonstrated expected half-life and pharmacokinetics for a human IgG. 85 In two open-label trials of the safety, side-effect profile, pharmacokinetic properties, the antiviral activity of VRC01 was tested in persons with HIV infection who were undergoing ART (antiretroviral therapy) interruption. The antibody slightly delayed plasma viral rebound in the trial participants as compared with historical controls, but did not maintain viral suppression through week 8 86 VRC01 is being tested in multiple Phase 2 trials. [87] [88] [89] 3BNC117: Human antibody 3BNC117was isolated from single B cells of a patient with high titers of broadly neutralizing Antibody therapies for viral infections G Salazar et al. antibodies. This antibody binds to an HIV gp120 core glycoprotein stabilized in the CD4-bound conformation and lacking the variable (V) loops 1 to 3. 90 Antibody 3BNC117 blocked infection and suppressed viremia in macaques infected with the R5 tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8, which emulates many of the pathogenic and immunogenic properties of HIV-1 during infections of rhesus macaques. 91 In Phase 1 trial, 3BNC117 is safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viremia. 92 In a Phase 2a trial, 3BNC117 suppresses viral rebound in humans during treatment interruption. The antibody exerts strong selective pressure on HIV-1 emerging from latent reservoirs during analytical treatment interruption in humans. 93 In addition to suppressing viremia in HIV-1-infected individuals, 3BNC117 can enhance host humoral immunity to HIV-1 94 . Antibody 3BNC117 is also being tested in combination with a functionally similar broadly neutralizing antibody, 10-1074, in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 91, 95, 96 4E10, 2F5, and 2G12: Antibodies that recognize the highly conserved membrane proximal external region in the gp41 ectodomain stem of HIV such as 4E10, 2F5, and 2G12 have been tested in Phase 1/2 trials in well-suppressed HAART-treated individuals treated during acute and early HIV-1 infection. 97 Pro 140, Ibalizumab, and bispecific antibodies: In addition to antibodies directly targeting viral antigens to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection, antibodies targeting host receptors such as CCR5 and CD4 receptor are also being developed for HIV infection. For example, the CCR5 targeting humanized IgG4 mAb Pro 140 has been tested in clinical trials and the antibody exhibited potent, long-lived antiviral activity and was generally well tolerated. 79, 98, 99 Ibalizumab (iMab), a humanized mAb that binds to a conformational epitope on CD4 and blocks entry of HIV-1, is also being tested in clinical trials. 100 In another approach, bispecific Abs that combine the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of ibalizumab with that of anti-gp120 bNAbs were constructed for passive immunization to prevent HIV-1 infection. 101, 102 Respiratory syncytial virus Palivizumab, motavizumab, and motavizumab-YTE: In 1998, the FDA approved palivizumab, which binds to the F glycoprotein of the RSV for prophylaxis in children susceptible to severe disease. 103, 104 Motavizumab is an affinity matured derivative of palivizumab, tenfold more potent than palivizumab in F glycoprotein binding. 103, 105 In Phase 3 clinical trials, motavizumab recipients had a 26% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization compared with palivizumab recipients, and motavizumab was superior to palivizumab for reduction of RSV-specific outpatient lower respiratory tract infections (MALRIs, 50% relative reduction). 106 A half-life extended derivative of the antibody, known as motavizumab-YTE (motavizumab with amino-acid substitutions M252Y/S254T/T256E [YTE]), an Fc-modified anti-RSV mAb was also tested in Phase 1 trials. 107 Clearance of motavizumab-YTE was significantly lower (71 to 86%) and the half-life was two to fourfold longer than that of motavizumab in healthy participants. 107 The sustained serum concentrations of motavizumab-YTE were fully functional, as shown by RSV neutralizing activity that persisted for 240 days with motavizumab-YTE versus 90 days postdose for motavizumab. 107 Despite the improvements of motavizumab and motavizumab-YTE over palivizumab, the clinical benefits were considered incremental and they have not been approved for clinical use. MEDI8897, REGN2222, and ALX-0171: MEDI8897, which is 100fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro, is derived from D25 108 a mAb isolated from a B cell of a human donor targeting the 110 Not an IgG1 antibody, ALX-0171 is a single-domain camelid-derived antibody, or nanobody, targeting the RSV-F protein. Due to small size of the nanobody, ALX-0171 is being tested as a therapeutic by inhalation in Phase 2 in infants (aged 1-24 months) who were hospitalized with an RSV infection. 111 Ebola, Zika, rabies, and HBV. An outbreak of Ebola in West Africa between 2014 and 2015 affected 28,652 people and led to more than 11,325 deaths. 112 The lessons learned from the handling of that high mortality rate epidemic contribute to the call for taking innovative counter measures against emerging infectious diseases, including the use of mAbs. For example, an experimental mAb cocktail ZMapp was given special approval for compassionate use during the fast-moving epidemic. ZMapp is a combination of three mAbs (c13C6, c2G4, c4G7) optimized from two previous antibody cocktails (ZMab and MB-0033). 113 ZMapp showed protective efficacy in a rhesus macaques challenge model. 113 However, a randomized, controlled human trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care did not meet the statistical threshold set for improved efficacy as compared with the current standard of care alone (NCT02363322) [114] [115] [116] . Efforts to isolate potent neutralizing antibodies against Ebola are ongoing. For example, potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (EBOV GP) were isolated through sequential immunization of rhesus macaques and antigenspecific single B-cell sorting. 117 Similarly, potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the Ebola EBOV GP were isolated from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor who survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire outbreak. 118 These highly potent neutralizing mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola. The outbreak of Zika in 2015-2016 and its association with congenital abnormalities also increased awareness of the urgent need to take measures against emerging infectious diseases. 119 Similar to combating Ebola and other viral infections, development of vaccines is the top priority to protect the population from Zika infection. 120 Antibody-based therapeutics are also proposed as an option for the treatment of Zika infection. 23 For example, two antibodies with potent ZIKV-specific neutralization, isolated from a single patient, provided postexposure protection to mice in vivo. 23 Structural studies revealed that Z23 and Z3L1 bound to tertiary epitopes in envelope protein domain I, II, or III, indicating potential targets for ZIKV-specific therapy. 23 Rabies occurs worldwide and it is almost invariably fatal once clinical symptoms develop. 121, 122 Rabies is mostly preventable if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered before clinical symptoms develop. PEP consists of thorough wound cleansing followed by immediate administration of rabies immune globulin (RIG), together with a full course of rabies vaccination. 123 However, due to the lack of education and availability of RIGs and vaccines, it was estimated that global canine rabies causes about 59,000 deaths mostly in Asia and Africa. 121 As the supply of human RIG (HRIG) and equine RIG (ERIG) is often limited, it is desirable to develop potent neutralizing human mAbs to replace RIGs. 123 CL184 is mixture of two human mAbs:CR57 and CR4098. Mab CR57, which binds to an epitope of the rabies glycoprotein, was isolated from a EBV-transformed memory B cell from a human subject vaccinated with inactivated rabies virus. 27, 124, 125 MAbCR4098, which recognizes a non-overlapping epitope of mAbCR57, was isolated from phage-displayed antibody libraries constructed from PBMCs of rabies virus vaccinated human subjects. 126 CL184 has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1/2 clinical studies to be safe and efficacious. 123, [127] [128] [129] HuMab 17C7, also known as RAB1 which was generated from transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin, is another potent rabies virus neutralizing mAb that has been tested in multiple clinical trials in India (CTRI/2009/091/000465 and CTRI/2012/05/002709). 130, 131 There are continuing efforts to identify more potent and broadly neutralizing mAbs against rabies. For example, two antibodies with potency and broad-spectrum reactivity, RVC20 and RVC58, were identified from immortalized B cells of vaccinated donors. 132 RVC20 and RVC58 were able to neutralize all 35 strains of rabies virus in vitro. Furthermore, they showed higher potency and breadth compared to antibodies under clinical development, including CR57, CR4098, and RAB1. 132 Hepatitis B can establish both acute and chronic infections that lead to serious liver disease. Maternal to fetal transmission is one important route keeping prevalence high in regions where the hepatitis B is endemic. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin antibody preparations are one form of countermeasure under investigation. 133 mAbs are also under development to supplement the suite of tools available to control the spread of HBV and associated disease. 134, 135 Dengue. Dengue is the world's most prevalent mosquito-borne disease, with an estimated 390 million people each year becoming infected. 136 Severe dengue, associated with infection with different strains of the virus, is characterized by vascular permeability, bleeding from mucosa and intestinal tract, dengue shock syndrome, and acute renal failure. 137 In contrast with HCMV where severe symptoms are accompanied by a detectable active phase, 138 dengue symptoms often appear after the peak of viremia; 139 therefore, an antibody applied for passive immunotherapy would have to be used before the onset of symptoms to be early enough to avoid viremia. Another difference between HCMV and dengue is that for HCMV, developing fetuses or infants and people with compromised immune systems are clearly at risk for the development of severe disease. 43 In contrast, there are no clear prognostic indicators for susceptibility to severe dengue virus disease. Such prognostic indicators are necessary due to practical limitations on the number of people who can receive passive immunotherapy. Further, dengue antibodies at subneutralizing concentrations may enhance uptake of dengue virus in a way that dramatically aggravates symptoms (antibodydependent enhancement, ADE). 136 Therefore, the development of vaccines has been the focus for dengue control. So far one vaccine has been approved, but the vaccine (CYD-TDV, Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur) is less than ideal and better dengue vaccines are urgently needed. 140 mAbs against dengue have been generated so their interaction with dengue could be analyzed to identify the virus' best target epitopes, a key first step in vaccine design. A summary of these epitopes and their associated antibodies is presented in several excellent reviews. 136, 141 The epitopes targeted by antibodies most effective at neutralizing dengue virus were grouped into broad classifications based on whether these epitopes were present in a single virion (epitopes on a monomer) or were composed of features on more than one virion (quaternary epitopes). Epitopes on a monomer were further grouped according by region of the dengue virion bound: prM protein, FLE (amino acids [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] , BC loop E protein domain II (amino acids 73,78, and 79), or EDIII. Quaternary epitopes were also sub-divided into EDE epitopes (EDI, EDII, and EDIII); E protein epitopes (monomer EDI, EDI-EDII hinge, and EDIII; intact virion only); and E protein herring-bone epitope (EDI, EDI-EDII hinge, and EDIII). Although no dengue antibody therapeutics have reached the stage of clinical trials, some of Antibody therapies for viral infections G Salazar et al.

broadly neutralizing antibodies have the potential to be developed into therapeutics against dengue infections. [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] Dengue targeting antibodies at high concentration may enhance infection. Therefore, therapeutic antibodies need to be engineered to abolish the interaction of antibodies to the FcγRs on macrophages, thus preventing ADE. 149 For example, a N297A mutation in the Fc region of D23-1G7C2 IgG1 was engineered to reduce the affinity of the IgG1 Fc region for FcγRs, resulting in a marked reduction in ADE activity in in vitro cell studies. 150 In another study, dengue neutralizing mAbs targeting distinct epitopes on the four DENV serotypes were engineered to prevent FcγR binding by introducing LALA (L234A-L235A) mutations in the IgG1 Fc region. The LALA variant did not enhance infection and neutralized DENV in vitro and in vivo as postexposure therapy in a mouse model of lethal DENV infection. 151 Perspective Only one mAb, specific to RSV, has been approved for prophylaxis use of viral infections. Several challenges impede the progress of the many antiviral mAbs in the pipeline. One key challenge is the relatively small market for antibody treatments of viral diseases, and potentially higher cost associated with production of recombinant antibodies, as compared to small molecule antivirals.

Another key challenge is the competition of other forms of treatment and prevention. Vaccines are often still the best approach to control viral infections, often with benefits of lifelong immunity. Even after effective mAb therapies are developed, their widespread application may be impractical due to the high costs of conventional production compared to other countermeasures against disease from viral infections. One way to address the problem of the high cost of mAb therapies is to reduce the cost of production. For instance, production of mAbs in scFv or Fab form or as camelid nanobodies enables relatively inexpensive expression in prokaryotic systems. 152 Another way to address the problem of high costs is financing through partnerships with traditional donors and newer funding sources such as the Gates Foundation. For example, development impact bonds have been tested as a way to eliminate rabies infection in dogs, in turn reducing demand for expensive treatments for humans. 153 A third key challenge is the complexity of pathology, epidemiology, and immunology that can be associated with infection. The way kinetics of infection informs therapeutic strategy, for instance, explains why no dengue mAbs are in clinical trials and why vaccination is the preferred method to control influenza. For dengue and influenza A, symptoms often appear after the peak of viremia; 139, 154 an antibody applied for passive immunotherapy would have to be used before the onset of symptoms to be early enough to avoid viremia. One potential solution is matching a therapeutic antibody with a rapid, point of care diagnostic test. The diagnostic could be used to identify patients with infection and susceptibility to severe disease who would benefit from passive immunotherapy with the therapeutic antibody. Finally, viruses can have complexity that prevents development of a single lasting treatment, for instance multiple strains, rapid evolution, and obscure mechanisms of infection and neutralization escape.

As discussed above, Fc region engineering has been shown effective for increasing the half-life of therapeutic antibodies, for instance the RSV mAb motavizumab YTE, and for preventing ADE through reduced FcR binding, as for dengue antibodies. The interactions of the Fc domain with diverse other receptors provides additional opportunities for engineering to optimize therapeutic efficacy of antibodies. The advantages and disadvantages of engineering approaches was recently reviewed by Bournazos and Ravetch. 155 Passive transfer of antibodies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections is easy to manage, but the high cost associated with antibody therapies is prohibitive in prophylactic use of antibodies for intractable viruses such as HIV and influenza A virus for a large population, particularly in low-resource areas. 156 One alternative to passive administration of antibody therapies involves the delivery of transgenes encoding well characterized neutralizing antibodies by a vector. The transgenes direct the expression of antibodies in non-hematopoietic cells, which then secrete mAbs into circulation. It has been demonstrated that intramuscular delivery by electroporation of synthetic DNA plasmids engineered to express modified human mAbs against multiple DENV serotypes confers protection against DENV disease and prevents ADE of disease in mice. 157 More work is needed before clinical applications, but vector delivery of prophylactic or therapeutic antibodies against viral infections is a promising alternative to the current practice of passive transfer.

"Avian IgY antibodies and their recombinant equivalents in research, diagnostics and therapy","The generation and use of avian antibodies is of increasing interest in a wide variety of applications within the life sciences. Due to their phylogenetic distance, mechanisms of immune diversification and the way in which they deposit IgY immunoglobulin in the egg yolk, chickens provide a number of advantages compared to mammals as hosts for immunization. These advantages include: the one-step purification of antibodies from egg yolk in large amounts facilitates having a virtually continuous supply; the epitope spectrum of avian antibodies potentially grants access to novel specificities; the broad absence of cross-reactivity with mammalian epitopes avoids assay interference and improves the performance of immunological techniques. The polyclonal nature of IgY antibodies has limited their use since avian hybridoma techniques are not well established. Recombinant IgY, however, can be generated from mammalian monoclonal antibodies which makes it possible to further exploit the advantageous properties of the IgY scaffold. Moreover, cloning and selecting the immune repertoire from avian organisms is highly efficient, yielding antigen-specific antibody fragments. The recombinant approach is well suited to circumvent any limitations of polyclonal antibodies. This review presents comprehensive information on the generation, purification, modification and applications of polyclonal and monoclonal IgY antibodies.","Antibodies are likely to remain the affinity molecules of choice in a wide variety of analytical, biochemical, and medical approaches. This is primarily because they have familiar properties and their use is well-established in many applications. Moreover, their specificities and biological effects can now be readily manipulated using standard molecular biological techniques. In most cases mammalian antibodies are perfectly adequate. Unfortunately, their involvement in the immune response and immunemediated pathologies along with a high degree of conservation among mammals can, however, make them susceptible to unwanted interactions with conserved proteins, which can in turn hamper their use in certain approaches.

The immunization of chickens provides an attractive alternative [1e3] to using mammals as hosts for antibody production. IgY is the major low molecular weight immunoglobulin in oviparous animals. This type of antibody has distinctive properties which can be exploited in various ways in research, diagnostics and therapy. One important advantage arises from the phylogenetic distance and genetic background that distinguishes birds from mammals. This improves the likelihood that an immune response will be elicited against antigens or epitopes that may be non-immunogenic in mammals. The deposition of IgY into the egg yolks of the immunized bird then provides an elegant source of polyclonal immunoglobulins. Since polyclonal IgY can be recovered from the eggs of laying hens for prolonged periods, this approach provides a longterm supply of substantial amounts of antibodies. In addition, such antibodies exhibit biochemical and structural features, which can render them superior in virtually all types of immunoassays, especially those designed to detect molecules in specimens like mammalian blood or serum [4, 5] .

Due to the technical difficulties of avian hybridoma techniques, and the problem that existing immortalized B cell lines (such as the ALV-induced bursa-derived lymphoma line DT40) undergo Ig gene conversion during in vitro culture [6] , the production of chicken antibodies languished somewhat until it became possible to generate monoclonal IgY through the in vitro selection from combinatorial antibody libraries by phage display [7] . In the chicken, only a single functional V and J segment is present in the light and heavy chain gene loci. As a result, diversification of the avian immune repertoire is introduced into the rearranged V(D)J segments by gene conversion using pseudo V genes as donors. As will be seen, this greatly simplifies the construction of combinatorial recombinant antibody libraries while the selective power of phage display provides a way of accessing unique binders.

This review focuses on the immunological background and novel approaches that have been made possible as a result of avian antibody technologies. It suggests that the chicken can be more widely used for generating both native, and recombinant IgY.

IgY is the predominant low molecular weight serum immunoglobulin isotype in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. This designation derives from its occurrence in egg yolk, and, as demonstrated in 1893, it transfers immunity from the hen to the developing embryo [8] .

Among the three avian isotypes (IgY, IgM and IgA), IgY is the most abundant in serum, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 mg/ml in laying hens [9, 10] compared to the lower concentrations of IgM (1e3 mg/ml) and IgA (0.3e0.5 mg/ml). In anseriform birds like ducks there exists in addition to IgY, an alternatively spliced version of IgY, the IgY DFc. This variant lacks the Fc region and therefore does not have the Fc-mediated secondary effector functions. It is also found in relatively substantial amounts (1e3 mg/ml) [11] .

The organs in the chicken responsible for antibody production differ significantly from those in mammals. The central (primary) lymphoid organs are represented by the thymus and bursa of Fabricius (BF), while peripheral (secondary) lymphoid organs include the spleen, Harderian glands, bone marrow, conjunctivalassociated lymphoid tissue (CALT), bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Chickens do not have lymph nodes as such, but instead have lymphoid nodules associated with the lymphatics [12] .

The BF is located above the cloaca in the caudal body cavity and plays a cardinal role in avian B cell development and antibody diversification [13] . Following colonization by a small number of B cell precursors, cells expressing surface immunoglobulin undergo rapid proliferation such that at about two months of age there are approximately 10 4 follicles in the BF [14] . A few weeks after hatching, about 5% of the bursal cells migrate each day into the blood and then into the spleen, thymus, and caecal tonsils, where they subsequently produce immunoglobulins. The spleen is the largest secondary lymphoid organ and is important for antigen processing and in the production of antibodies after hatching [15] .

Although IgY is essentially an immunoglobulin with characteristics and functions similar to IgG, it possesses a slightly different structure which provides its distinct properties and biochemical behaviour. IgY has a slightly higher molecular mass (approximately 167 kDa) than its mammalian counterpart [16] due to the presence of four constant-and one variable Ig heavy chain domains. The nucleotide sequence of the chicken upsilon (y) heavy chain [17] reveals that as with the more ancient amphibian IgY [18, 19] , the avian molecule contains a domain (Cy2) which is conserved in mammalian IgE, but was condensed to form the flexible ""hinge"" region in mammalian IgG [17] . An orthologous domain must therefore have existed in the IgY-like ancestor prior to duplication and subsequent divergence from the mammalian lineage.

In mammals, IgG forms immune complexes and facilitates opsonisation, activates the complement system and provides protection for the foetus upon transport across the placenta. IgE can sensitize effector cells and mediates anaphylactic reactions [20] . IgY appears to combine mammalian IgG-and IgE-like functions since it not only provides defence against infections [21] , but may also mediate anaphylaxis [22] . In contrast to mammals, basophils are much more numerous in birds than mast cells [23] and antibodydependent hypersensitivity and fatal systemic anaphylaxis [22, 24, 25] are mainly mediated by these cells [26] . This constitutes indirect evidence for the presence of IgY receptors on effector cells. IgY binds to monocytes with IgG-like kinetics [27] , despite its putative IgE like structure as predicted from the chicken y heavy chain primary sequence [17] . Recently, the chicken leucocyte receptor complex (LRC) was analysed and four major types of chicken Ig-like receptors (CHIR) were identified: CHIR-A, activating receptors displaying two extracellular C2-type Ig-domains, CHIR-B, inhibitory receptors also displaying two C2-like Ig-domains, and two types of CHIR-AB with one or two C2-like Ig-domains, which are reported to have bifunctional potential, since they display features of both inhibitory and activating receptors [28, 29] . So far, CHIR-AB1 and its recently identified homologues are the only receptors in the LRC of known specificity [30] . It functions as a classical Fc receptor expressed on chicken B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells [31] . In contrast to IgG and IgE receptors, CHIR-AB1 binds in a similar way as FcaRI or FcRn with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Its affinity is comparable with the values reported for IgA binding to its receptor [32] . In contrast to mammalian IgG or IgE the CHIR-AB1 binding site was mapped to the upsilon heavy chain domains 3 and 4 (Cy3/Cy4) interface, a finding that together with the phylogenetic relationship of the antibodies and their receptors indicates a substantial shift in the nature of Fc receptor binding during evolution [33, 34] . A specific interaction between CHIR-AB1, which provides an inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic tail and the Fc portion of IgY was shown to enhance calcium release in a chicken B cell line expressing CHIR-AB1 and the common activating g-chain [31] . The activation required aggregation of IgY suggesting that immune complexes are required to trigger a response [31] . By comparing CHIR-AB1-like sequences in databases, 18 homologues of CHIR-AB1 have been identified and cloned. These comprised non-IgY-binding and IgY-binding isoforms displaying different affinities [30] .

An additional FcR-related gene designated Gallus gallus FcR (ggFcR) was recently identified [35] . The receptor which selectively binds IgY consists of four extracellular C2-set Ig domains. Surprisingly, ggFcR is closely related to chicken LCR encoded genes, but is located on chromosome 20 distinct from the LCR and FcR gene clusters. Recently a chicken yolk sac IgY receptor (FcRY) responsible for IgY transport from yolk to the embryonic circulation was characterized as a homologue of the mammalian phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a member of the mannose receptor family [36] . Deposition in the yolk however is mediated by another receptor not yet cloned [10] the specificity of which has been addressed by different approaches. One factor restricting the deposition of IgM and IgA in the yolk appears to be their polymeric nature [37] . The Fc region structure may also be important since anseriform species like ducks preferentially incorporate full-length IgY into the egg yolk over the truncated isoform IgY DFc [38] . Site-specific mutagenesis experiments using mammalian IgG sequences and extrapolation of this information to the upsilon heavy chain suggested the Cy2/Cy3 interface, especially residues 362e365, and positions 550e553 within Cy4 as essential for the interaction with the receptor [39] . Besides its function and interaction with Fc receptors, IgY differs from IgG in a variety of aspects which are more directly attributable to the molecule itself. As mentioned earlier, the phylogenetic distance between the avian immune system and mammalian proteins most likely increases the immune response towards the respective antigens. This means that IgY can often be raised against epitopes on highly conserved proteins when other mammals fail to provide an immunological response [40, 41] . The extent to which the overall antibody affinities of mammalian IgG and IgY relate to each other is still under investigation but monoclonal IgY antibody fragments generally exhibit reactivities at least comparable to those of IgG (unpublished observations).

Compared to mammalian IgG IgY is lacking the flexible hinge region and, thus, thought to be a more rigid immunoglobulin. This hinge-less structure is also found in mammalian IgE. IgY therefore exhibits structural features of both mammalian IgE and IgG, a finding also supported by a structural analysis of the IgY Fc portion [42] . Potentially reduced molecular flexibility might be associated with decreased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation or fragmentation. Nevertheless, IgY can be fragmented by papain or trypsin [43] . IgY, like mammalian IgG, is reasonably stable and can be stored for several months under standard conditions [44] . A serious limitation of IgY for therapeutic applications, however, is its reduced stability at low pH [44, 45] . In contrast to IgG the antigen binding activity of IgY decreases significantly under acidic conditions. As demonstrated by circular dichroism analyses, loss of activity of chicken IgY is accompanied by significant conformational changes, a fact attributed to fewer intramolecular disulphide linkages than, for example, rabbit IgG [46] .

Today, production of polyclonal IgY by immunization of chickens is offered on a routine basis by several commercial companies. In general, this approach is subject to the same constraints as the conventional immunization of mammals. Nevertheless, the advantages of chickens being a non-mammalian species [47] and the bloodless isolation of immunoglobulins have perhaps not yet been fully appreciated and exploited.

Egg yolk collected after immunization can provide concentrations of IgY in the range of 10 mg/ml as starting source for the recovery of the immunoglobulin. Relatively simple methods may be used to extract the antigen-specific immunoglobulin from egg yolk with several commercial kits being available. The decision to use a particular protocol is usually brought about by the intended downstream applications as well as the expertise and equipment available [48] . One of the most frequently used procedures involves protein precipitation with ammonium sulphate, dextran sulphate or polyethylene glycol (PEG). A particularly efficient method comprises two successive precipitations by using 3.5% PEG to remove any lipids, followed by 12% PEG to precipitate the IgY. A variant protocol includes an emulsification step, adding one volume of chloroform to one volume of egg yolk rather than using fractional precipitation [49, 50] .

IgY can also be purified by conventional ion exchange chromatography [51] . Another strategy, useful as an additional ""polishing"" step, relies on thiophilic adsorption chromatography (TAC) in which the target protein adsorbs to a sulphone thioether ligand in an interaction mediated predominantly by aromatic residues [52e54]. The elution conditions are very mild compared with conventional methods used to purify antibodies, such as protein A, G, or L, none of which bind to IgY. Nevertheless, purification strategies or polishing steps based on affinity ligands might be helpful, in particular when high purity is desired. Anti-IgY antibodies and synthetic ligands [55, 56] are available, but this spectrum of reagents could be broadened by using soluble IgY receptor constructs or other affinity molecules as affinity medium. For instance, SSL7, the superantigen-like protein 7 from Staphylococcus aureus can be used for affinity purification of IgY (unpublished data). Additionally, recombinant expression of CHIR in mammalian cells and in Escherichia coli is highly efficient and can potentially provide a highly homogeneous protein fraction (unpublished data).

Polyclonal preparations of IgY are suitable for many routine applications. In some diagnostic approaches, however, the use of monoclonal reagents is imperative for accuracy, reproducibility and standardisation. Even though hybridoma technology has been applied to avian species, there are technical obstacles, which together with low secretion rates of fusion lines limit its efficacy [57, 58] . These obstacles can, however, be circumvented by using recombinant antibody technologies to address the need for monoclonal IgY.

An antibody essentially represents the sum of its antigenbinding moieties and the Fc portion which is essential for dimerization, effector functions and facilitates detection using conventional secondary reagents. When deciding on a reagent for a particular application, it is important to consider whether an authentic fully avian antibody is required or whether parts may in fact be derived from other species. Both avian IgY and chimeric IgY with avian constant domains and murine binding moieties have recently been produced [59, 60] . In these studies, despite their heterologous origins, transfected mammalian cells were able to stably express different IgY-based constructs.

The successful secretion of immunoglobulins from mammalian cells requires that chaperones interact with nascent immunoglobulin chains and guide their folding and assembly. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) binds transiently to most domains of the Ig heavy chain (CH) and some variable regions of the light and heavy chain (VH and VL) [61, 62] . CH1 provides a site for covalent attachment of CL and interacts stably with BiP in the absence of light chains [63] . Pronounced differences in the amino acids sequences within the antibody constant domains of antibodies from birds and mammals and the potential loss of specific interaction sites for chaperones with the nascent immunoglobulin chains might conceivably affect the efficiencies with which mammalian cells can secrete avian antibodies. For instance, IgY was found to be more efficiently secreted than IgG1, possibly as a result of less stringent control by the ER secretion machinery [60] . Since having efficient and economic ways of producing antibodies is always desirable, yields might in some cases be improved by using the binding moieties from pre-existing murine hybridomas to generate chimeric IgY. Moreover, the enormous diversity of the synthetic antibody libraries available today means that immune animals are not necessarily needed to derive suitable binders. Indeed, frameworks of synthetic human [64] and avian [65] variable regions have been successfully converted to their IgY derivatives and produced in eukaryotic hosts.

The primary sequence of the IgY heavy chain provides two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, both of which are located in the Fc region, namely Asn308 and Asn407 [17] . Carbohydrate analysis of native IgY revealed mono-glucosylated oligomannose type oligosaccharides, oligomannose type oligosaccharides and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides [66] . The first two of these have been reported as being the major glycoforms in IgY from different species [66e68] and are attributed to the Cy3 glycosylation site [69] . Additionally, a terminal sialic acid was identified in native IgY. No significant differences between the overall glycosylation pattern of native and recombinant IgY produced in mammalian cells could be detected using common lectins, thereby confirming that recombinant IgY from this source closely resembles the native immunoglobulin [60] . However, recombinant production of IgY in different hosts is likely to result in variable glycosylation patterns. As a result, the biochemical properties of recombinant and native IgY are likely to differ. Since glycosylation of immunoglobulins is not only implicated in a variety of physiological mechanisms but also influences their physicochemical behaviour, recombinant IgY may not always be suitable for all the potential applications envisaged for it.

To summarise, authentic polyclonal IgY is relatively easy to generate while recombinant antibody technology provides access to avian monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, pre-existing antibodies can now be converted to IgY when necessary for specific individual applications.

Eggs constitute a very common component of our diet and are therefore tolerated by the human immune system. Topical administration of IgY may therefore represent an attractive approach to immunotherapy with a reduced risk of toxic side effects. While it is now widely accepted that IgY applied to human mucosal surfaces does not exhibit any immunogenicity, potentially detrimental effects might be anticipated in patients that are sensitized against egg proteins (including IgY), but this aspect is discussed later in the context of assay performance (see Section 6). Although immunogenic when applied systemically, the oral uptake of IgY antibodies opens up new possibilities for therapeutic interventions with respect to a variety of pathologies including, but not limited to, pulmonary or gastrointestinal infections (for overview see Table 1 ) [70] . Such approaches have been effective in reducing bacterial and viral loads in animal studies as well as in clinical trials in human cohorts [71e73] .

Besides being suitable in approaches that target infective processes, IgY has been suggested for blocking, inhibition and delivery in those pathological conditions which demand specific reagents in substantial amounts. Chicken antibodies are well established as anti-toxins and/or for passive vaccination. For instance, specific anti-venom IgY can neutralize bacterial toxins [117] and be used to treat snake bites [118e125]. Indeed, antivenom IgY can provide a higher bioactivity than antidotes raised in horses [126] . In such applications, egg yolks can provide a continuous supply of potentially superior reagents.

Today's consumers have become increasingly interested in foods that supposedly promote health and reduce the risk of disease. Incorporating egg yolks of immunized chickens into certain foodstuffs, for example drinking yoghurt or mouthwash can provide the consumer with a functional food that can potentially protect against pathogens (so-called ""edible vaccines"") without him or her having to consume synthetic pharmaceuticals [107,127e130] . A potential drawback of IgY in some therapeutic or prophylactic approaches is its reduced stability under harsh conditions such as an acidic environment. This is especially true for gastrointestinal applications. Different strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy have therefore been evolved including a variety of techniques for stabilizing or controlling the release of IgY [86,131e133] .

So far, the therapeutic interventions mentioned above are all confined to polyclonal native IgY obtained from egg yolk after immunization of hens. In contrast, the therapeutic potential of recombinant monoclonal IgY molecules remains to be explored, but it is perhaps here where the greatest potential of IgY paratopes fused to human Fc regions lies.

Applying combinatorial approaches in biology and chemistry demands high efficiency and where possible, simple and straightforward techniques. Chicken therefore provide an ideal basis for generating large immune antibody fragment libraries as compared to most mammalian species [134] . The inherent complexity of mammalian diversification mechanisms can make it difficult to recover antibody sequences. This is especially true in humans and mice. The genetic organization of these mammals is based on the modular use and recombination of a broad panel of V, D, and J segments which are further diversified by several different mechanisms. Therefore, accessing and amplifying mouse and human repertoires requires a large set of different oligonucleotides to cover the entire set of V segments which is prone to preferential amplification of high abundance transcripts and the potential loss of particular V segments during PCR. In chickens, genetic diversification is achieved differently. Both the heavy and light chain loci consist of single functional V and J genes, (and D segments for the heavy chain) that are rearranged using conventional V(D)J recombination mechanisms. In order to generate a large, diverse antibody repertoire and to allow affinity maturation upon antigen priming avian species utilize a unique mode of DNA recombination, termed gene conversion (reviewed in [135] ). In this process, short DNA segments from non-functional V pseudogenes located upstream are inserted into the rearranged gene. These modulate the primary structure and, hence the binding characteristics of the resulting immunoglobulin. However, the 5 0 -and 3 0 -ends of the rearranged gene remain unaltered thus allowing the diversity of the chicken humoural immune system to be recovered by the use of only two pairs of primers.

The first avian repertoires were cloned more than a decade ago [134, 136] . Somewhat surprisingly, at first little attention was paid to those libraries, a fact that might be attributed to a lack of familiarity with chicken immunization and the need for established recombinant antibody technologies. Over the past few years, chicken libraries have attracted wider interest and accordingly, reports on the isolation of chicken-derived antibody fragments have steadily increased (for an overview see Table 2 ).

The targets for these antibodies have included difficult antigenic structures such as haptens, highly conserved proteins and complex crude extracts. Interestingly, the avian VH/VL scaffold has been employed not only for the generation of immune but also naïve as well as semi-synthetic single chain antibody (scFv) libraries [143] . This approach allows entirely avian recombinant antibody formats aimed especially at diagnostics.

The exclusive use of single variable region genes makes the humanization of avian antibody fragments more practical than the humanization of rodent antibodies with their plethora of variable region genes. This could be shown for the engineering of an antiprion and an anti-IL12 antibody [153, 154] . Human frameworks and CDR grafting followed by further optimization were used to provide the proof of principle for this approach.

In summary, the generation and use of avian immune repertoire libraries represent a powerful approach with the potential to both complement established methods and to provide novel and original approaches. In addition, the different spectrum of epitopes recognized by the avian immune system could facilitate the development of novel therapeutics, particularly if the technology of chimeric chicken/mammalian fusions can be fully exploited.

Generally, one of the most intriguing and extraordinary characteristics of IgY is the lack of most, if not any, interactions with mammalian immune components. This makes IgY especially suited to applications in which the use of its mammalian counterparts is prone to unwanted cross-reactivities. For instance, in proteomics, pretreating of serum samples with IgY to specifically neutralize highly abundant serum components was found to improve downstream analyses [155] . In another study the identification of underrepresented serum proteins and disease marker candidate discovery was simplified when specific IgY was used as a blocking reagent [156, 157] . This approach was facilitated by the general characteristics of IgY such as the ease of production and the low incidence of cross-reactivity.

In the case of immunoassays, homologous mammalian immunoglobulins may have deleterious effects on the performance of many different types of immunoassays. In particular, approaches using immunoglobulins as bioactive molecules to capture or detect the analyte are often affected by heterophilic antibodies and/or high levels of non-specific binding. In addition, antigenindependent specific binding via immunoglobulin Fc receptors or lectins and non-immunoglobulin-based interactions, e.g. those mediated by complement factors [158] , can result in false-positive and false-negative results [159, 160] . As recently summarized [159] , Table 1 Overview of therapeutic approaches in humans and animals [71,72, Passive protection in rainbow trouts Lee et al. [116] estimates of the prevalence of assay interference by heterophilic antibodies range from 1 to 80% [161e166]. A more thorough analysis of over 11,000 sera in an anti-CEA assay format revealed that about 4% of the results were potentially false [167] . Approaches to eliminate heterophilic antibody interference include the removal or inactivation of interfering immunoglobulins, e.g. by precipitation with PEG [168] , the use of various buffer additives [167] , or the modification of assay antibodies by proteolytically removing of Fc fragments [167, 169] . It is unlikely, however, that a single method can resolve these problems [170] . Alternatively, recombinant modifications like the humanization of animal derived antibodies [171] and the use of single-chain fragments [172] can be useful. Other possibilities include shifting to non-immunoglobulin affinity systems [173] such as affibodies or aptamers. Each of these approaches is of course likely to suffer from the particular drawbacks inherent in these molecules. Taking the foregoing into account, chicken-derived antibodies, either as polyclonal or monoclonal preparations, offer several obvious advantages over their mammalian homologues in certain applications since they do not interact with rheumatoid factor (RF), human anti-mouse IgG antibodies (HAMA), complement components or mammalian Fc receptors [174] .

Recombinant avian library-derived antibody fragments, such as scFvs have low functional affinities since they are monovalent. The first group to express IgY in mammalian cells was able to produce heterotetrameric IgY antibodies in CHO cells by recloning IgY heavy and light chains from a chicken hybridoma cell line [59] . Additionally, Greunke et al. could demonstrate that mammalian cells can express a variety of artificial IgY constructs including chimeric IgY antibodies and homodimeric scFv-constructs with the latter showing increased secretion efficiencies [60] .

Antibody constructs larger than individual scFvs may be more effective in some immunoassay systems. Chicken scFvs from a large semi-synthetic phage displayed library that recognised the 65 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP65) of Mycobacterium bovis were converted into larger bivalent constructs which more closely resemble IgY molecules. These ""gallibodies"" could be used for immunocapture in ELISA and could be readily conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles [66] .

Although most currently used immunotests are based on murine monoclonal antibodies, we have recently provided further evidence for the potential of the use of monoclonal IgY [60, 175] as a way of avoiding interference by RF and heterophilic antibodies in human serum samples [175] . Work in our laboratory has shown that monoclonal and polyclonal IgY antibodies bind neither to mammalian Fcg receptors CD64 and CD16A [175] nor to the human high affinity IgE receptor, despite similarities in the amino acid sequences of human IgE and avian IgY. The low degree of relationship between mammalian and avian Fc receptors [27, 31, 176, 177] explains these findings.

For some diagnostic applications, the advantages of IgY may be undermined by the prevalence of anti-chicken antibodies in certain individuals. Although various hen-egg proteins were implicated in allergies by both in vivo and in vitro investigations as early as 1912 [178] , reports on the occurrence of human IgY-specific antibodies are scarce and are focussed on IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. One study [179] demonstrated that 15 in 28 egg-allergic patients exhibited specific IgE binding against one or more egg yolk-derived antiviral chicken immunoglobulins. In contrast, according to another study the overall allergenic potential of IgY in animal models appears to be low [180] . To what extent IgY-specific antibodies of IgG, the isotype that is most relevant in immunological analyses, occur in individuals sensitized to egg yolk remains to be established.

Yet another potential source of unwanted interference in immunoassays might result from the interaction of carbohydrate binding serum proteins such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) with N-linked glycostructures in the IgY Fc region [17, 181] . However, such problems largely depend on the particular expression host needed to produce the IgY and could conceivably be counteracted by deleting the particular asparagine residues responsible for the interaction. Both N-glycosylation sites can be eliminated in recombinant IgY without severely affecting binding behaviour and production efficiency (unpublished observation).

Although it may well be worthwhile to convert many of the existing hybridoma-derived antibodies used in problematic immunoassays into recombinant IgY, the biochemical characteristics of such murine/avian chimeras might differ from those of the authentic avian antibody. Interference may still arise from proteins that interact specifically with rodent immunoglobulin variable regions such as HAMA, a potential consequence of therapeutic interventions using chimeric therapeutic antibodies. Today, however, since humanized antibodies are becoming more readily available for clinical applications, a decrease in the prevalence of HAMA can be expected.

Another approach to improving the reliability of immunoassays based on IgY and one of its receptors was developed very recently. In immunoassays aimed at detecting circulating Ig species specific for pathogens or other antigens, pools of human sera represent the immunologist's first choice as controls. These are sometimes not readily available, are usually expensive and vary in quality. Instead, artificial substitutes for human reference sera specific for virtually any protein of interest could easily be established (unpublished results) by using avian polyclonal or (under certain circumstances) monoclonal IgY complexed with the IgY-specific CHIR-AB1 ectodomain which has been genetically fused to human Ig Fc domains, as the binding moiety.

In summary, the ready availability of polyclonal egg-yolk immunoglobulins and the rise of recombinant technologies that can generate monoclonal IgY have focussed attention on the useful characteristics of avian antibodies. Moreover, the fact that monoclonal IgY and IgY-like constructs can now be obtained from combinatorial libraries, sometimes without immunisation, is likely to make IgY in all its manifestations much more widely used in research, diagnostics and therapeutics.

Antiviral therapeutic approaches for human rhinovirus infections,"Human rhinoviruses are the primary etiological agent of the common cold. This infection can be mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts, but can be associated with bronchiolitis in infants, pneumonia in the immunosuppressed and exacerbations of pre-existing pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many of these conditions can place significant economic costs upon healthcare infrastructure. There is currently no licensed vaccine for rhinovirus, as the large variety of rhinovirus serotypes has posed significant challenges for research. In this review, we discuss current knowledge around antiviral drugs and small molecule inhibitors of rhinovirus infection, as well as antiviral host defense peptides as exciting prospects to approach the development of novel therapeutics which target human rhinovirus.","addition, the significant morbidities and associated economic costs attributed to RV infections would lend weight to a global effort into the full characterization of different RV strains. Thus, the development of effective antivirals against the widest possible number of RV serotypes is urgently required.

The number of established chemotherapeutic options for viral infections is still relatively low, and studies have been undertaken with a view to characterizing the anti-RV activity of drugs already licensed for use against other infections. There have been in excess of 90 antiviral drugs used for the medical treatment of viral infections, and these have been categorized into 13 functional groups (reviewed in [20] ). The viral infections with antiviral treatment options include HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, herpesvirus, influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human papillomavirus. While none of these drugs have been licensed for use in RV infection, a number of existing therapeutics have been demonstrated to have antiviral activity against a number of RV serotypes and thus are exciting prospects for therapeutic use in this infection.

Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that can interfere with the synthesis of viral mRNA. It is frequently used as an effective therapeutic in combination with pegylated IFNα-2a for the treatment of hepatitis C infection and has also been used individually by clinicians in the treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV [21, 22] . Other infections caused by respiratory pathogens such as adenovirus have also been treated by ribavirin, normally in patients that are immunocompromised or those who have received bone marrow or stem cell transplants [23] . Coronaviruses associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome have also been studied in the context of ribivirin therapy, although the outcomes have been mixed, and conjunctive therapy with pegylated IFNα-2a has again been suggested [24, 25] . In addition, ribavirin has also been utilized in the treatment of several viral hemorrhagic fevers, caused by pathogens such as hantavirus and Lassa virus, but also in the treatment of nairovirus, the cause of the tick-borne disease Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [26, 27, 28] . However, the drug is not reported to be active against Marburg virus, Ebola virus and dengue virus, and only appears to have limited activity against HSV, but not HIV [29, 30, 31] . In the context of RV infection, ribavirin and a number of modified analogs have been shown to have moderate antiviral activity against RV-13 [32] . RV-87 was also reported to be moderately susceptible to treatment, although other in vitro studies using alternative serotypes of RV, such as RV-14, have suggested that ribavirin is relatively ineffective [33, 34] . However, clinical reports of ribavirin therapy twinned with the use of IFNα-2a have indicated that combinatorial therapy could be of value with patients reportedly exhibiting enhanced clearance of RV infections following treatment with these two compounds [35] .

A number of studies have focused upon the effectiveness of the compound pleconaril against human RV. Pleconaril (3-(3,5-dimethyl-4-((3-(3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl)propyl)phenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole) is known to display broad spectrum antiviral activity against a range of viral pathogens. It is known to bind to hydrophobic pockets within viral capsids, altering binding of the viral pathogen to host cell receptors and blocking uncoating [36] . In RV and others, this is believed to take place in the VP1 protein, the largest and most exposed surface protein of the capsid [37] . One comprehensive study examined the effectiveness of pleconaril against a selection of five RV serotypes (RV-2, RV-14, RV-16, RV-39 and RV-Hanks [later serotyped as A21]) and 46 clinical isolates using in vitro cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays [38] . The study demonstrated that the compound had effective antiviral activity against the five serotypes (median EC50 of 0.02 μg/ml) and against the majority of the untyped clinical isolates. Two separate studies also demonstrated findings in accord with this, showing antiviral activity of pleconaril against RV-14 and RV-87 [33, 34] . Interestingly, analysis of several RV serotypes has also assessed structural features of amino acids that make up the VP1 protein, and has identified several common sequences and mutations that confer natural resistance to capsid binding compounds such as pleconaril, as well as those that could arise as a result of antiviral drug treatment [39, 40] . A number of human experimental pleconaril administration studies have found that pleconaril could offer a tangible treatment option for RV infection as volunteers treated with this drug appeared to show less clinical symptomology and lower recovery of picornaviruses than controls [41, 42] . However, varying virus serotype susceptibility to pleconaril did appear to play a significant role in the efficacy of the treatment and clinical outcome [43] . However, studies into pleconaril analogs with enhanced activity against RV are still ongoing [44] .

A number of other novel capsid binding compounds have shown effective antiviral activity against rhinovirus, and another capsid binding protein that has generated intense interest is pirodavir. A study of this compound showed showed antiviral activity against RV-14 and against RV-87 [33, 34] . A comprehensive assessment was undertaken by Brown et al. (2005) , who established that pirodavir had substantial antiviral activity against a range of 15 different serotypes of RV [45] . Interestingly, RV-45 appeared to be completely resistant to this compound. However, in the same study, a series of pyridazinylpiperidinyl-based compounds were synthesized and one derivative was also found to be particularly effective against a number of the RV serotypes [45] . In a similar context, an analog of pirodavir, termed BTA798 has also shown effective activity against several RV serotypes and has been assessed in Phase II clinical trials [34, 46] . Another capsid binding drug, vapendavir, which has been shown to inhibit enterovirus-71, has very recently also been utilized in Phase II clinical trials, but at the time of writing, the efficacy of this treatment is as yet unclear.

The compound rupintrivir, also known as AG7088, is an inhibitor of viral 3C protease, an enzyme that is virally encoded and essential for RV replication. Studies of rupintrivir in the context of RV infection has revealed that it exhibits moderate antiviral activity in vitro against a range of RV serotypes, enterovirus-71 and coxsackievirus [34, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] . Additionally, it demonstrated efficacy in a Phase II clinical trial of experimental RV infection and was well tolerated by human subjects in multiple human exposures [52, 53] . Interestingly, a recent study has also revealed that analogs of rupintrivir based on proline and azetidine modifications to this compound have also revealed broad spectrum activity against a range of RV serotypes [54] . Of further interest was the observation that rupintrivir also exhibited in vitro activity against newly discovered human RV C strains [55] . Assessment of the potential for RV to evolve resistance to rupintrivir has also been conducted, with selection of novel RV variants in increasing concentrations of the drug displaying minimal to moderate susceptibility reductions [56] . Collectively, it is clear that this compound, and novel analogs, have potential for the development of novel therapeutics for RV, but that further in vivo trials are required.

In our literature review, we have also identified a number of other small compounds that have been investigated as novel inhibitors of RV over the past four decades. These include the compound 2-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)-5nitrobenzonitrile (MDL-860) which showed antiviral activity against RV and other viral pathogens [57, 58] . Other studies have identified novel ((biphenyloxy)propyl) isoxazole derivatives as having activity against RV-2 [59] . A very recent report describes a series of benzothiophene derivatives [60] that inhibited the replication of a number of RV serotypes and was proposed to act through viral capsid binding in a similar way to pleconaril. Recently, three novel epidithiodiketopiperazines (KCN-2,2'-epi-19, KCN-19 and KCN-21) were synthesized that displayed activity against RV-87 [33] . Interestingly, the antifungal compound itraconozole has recently been found to have in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity in RV infection [61] . This was potentially due to inhibition of cellular cholesterol trafficking, a process the authors suggest, in accord with another study [62] , is essential for RV replication. This activity was retained when assessing the antiviral activity of itraconozole-loaded microemulsion droplets as carriers for the drug [63] , Indeed, antiviral nanoparticles have been proposed to be excellent candidates for the development of antiviral therapeutics as their activity can extend across a broad range of pathogens [64] , although further investigation on the in vivo effects of different nanoparticle formulations is required, as we have recently shown carbon nanoparticles to be capable of inhibiting the antiviral effects of the human cathelicidin, LL-37, toward RV in vitro [65] .

At last, in vitro studies and clinical trials have suggested that the red seaweed polysaccharide, carrageenan, has antiviral activity against RV both in vitro and in vivo. Iota-carrageenan, a sulphated variety, was demonstrated to prevent the replication of RV-1A, 2, 8, 14, 16, 83 and 84 in nasal epithelium [66] . A clinical trial examining the effect of iota-carrageenan containing nasal spray found that patients found to be positive for RV infection and treated with nasal spray demonstrated a significant reduction in the duration of symptoms and enhanced resolution of the infection when compared with placebo control [67] .

Host defense peptides (HDPs; also known as antimicrobial peptides) are key effector molecules of the innate immune response [68] . These peptides are found in many vertebrate and invertebrate organisms and display broad antimicrobial potential, acting directly on viruses and bacteria. In humans and other mammals, there are two primary families of HDPs that have been well characterized in terms of antimicrobial activity; cathelicidins and defensins.

HDPs can be expressed by leukocytes and epithelial cells, while being relatively unaffected by modern drug resistance mechanisms [69] . In addition to their powerful direct antiviral and antibacterial activity, it has also been demonstrated that these peptides possess immunomodulatory and inflammomodulatory activity and they can future science group www.futuremedicine.com alter host cellular responses to viral infection [70] . As such, HDPs represent an exciting opportunity for naturally occurring or synthetic peptide derivatives to be used as novel therapeutic approaches for viral infection [71] . Cathelicidins are a well characterized family of HDPs with some of the most powerful antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. Cathelicidins are a highly conserved family of peptides found in a number of species, and represent one of the primary effector defense molecules against invading microorganisms. The sole human cathelicidin, human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide of 18 kDA (hCAP18), from which the active form, LL-37, is proteolytically cleaved, is primarily stored in the specific granules of neutrophils and cleaved into the active form by proteinase-3. LL-37 can also be produced and secreted by macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells [72] .

Studies have shown that deficiency in LL-37 in humans leads to an increased susceptibility to infection [73] , and mice deficient in the murine cathelicidin (mCRAMP) also display an increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral infections of the airway tract, skin, urinary tract and gut [74, 75, 76] . On the contrary, exogenous delivery of LL-37 in murine models offered enhanced clearance and reduced mortality in lethal influenza infection [77] .

The antimicrobial properties of cathelicidins have been attributed to their highly cationic charge, which allows for the interaction with negatively charged bacterial and viral membranes leading to the formation of pores, and their hydrophobicity which helps the integration of the peptides into the microbial membranes. Cathelicidins have shown potent antiviral activity against a number of viruses (reviewed in [70] ) but the exact mechanism of action is still not fully elucidated. It is clear that the underlying antiviral mechanism of cathelicidins appears to be partly due to direct effects on the virus envelope, and this has been extensively shown in in vitro studies. Both LL-37, and the murine cathelicidin mCRAMP, have shown the ability to damage the viral envelope of vaccinia virus, influenza A virus (IAV) and HSV [77, 78, 79, 80] . LL-37 has also been shown to target viral envelope proteins inhibiting dengue virus entry into host cells [81] .

However, studies have also revealed that cathelicidins have the ability to inactivate nonenveloped viruses, such as adenovirus and RV [70, 80, 82] . In the context of RV, it was found that optimal inhibition of virus replication was reached when the virus was directly exposed to the peptide prior to infection of cells. However, studies with other viral pathogens have shown that host cell pretreatment or delayed treatment with exogenous LL-37 also inhibited RSV and IAV replication to an extent [83, 84, 85] . In vivo studies have also demonstrated the ability of LL-37 to modulate inflammatory responses to viral infections by inhibiting excessive inflammation in IAV-infected mice [77] . This indicates that the mechanisms underpinning cathelicidins antiviral activity are complex and that direct interaction with virus particles allows peptide-mediated damage of, or binding to, the viral envelope may be a key requirement for this activity. However, interactions with host cells and modulation of the inflammatory and innate antiviral response could also be of critical importance in the activities of these peptides.

We and others have shown that exogenous LL-37, or vitamin D-mediated cathelicidin production, has potent direct antiviral activity against RV [82, 86, 87] , including cathelicidins from other mammalian species, such as the porcine cathelicidin, protegrin-1, and the ovine cathelicidin SMAP-29 [82] . This indicates that the antiviral activity of cathelicidins is not species-specific against human RV. To further investigate the mechanism underpinning LL-37 activity, we assessed the ability of LL-37 to induce cell death in RV-infected airway epithelial cells as previously we had reported that LL-37 induced apoptotic cell death of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected lung epithelial cells [88] . In contrast to these observations, LL-37 did not induce apoptosis or necrosis in RV-infected airway epithelial cells [82] . In addition to its direct antiviral activity, LL-37 has also shown the ability to modulate inflammation [89] , which may prove to be a key property in the development of therapeutics that modulate the inflammatory response to viral infections.

Vitamin D is known for its positive effects on bone mineralization and calcium metabolism, and severe deficiency has classically been linked to rickets. Mounting evidence now points to a key immunomodulatory role for vitamin D and to a link between vitamin D deficiency and increased susceptibility to acute viral infections [90] . Furthermore, despite conflicting reports and heterogeneity within studies, a recent systematic review encompassing 10933 participants in 25 randomized controlled trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infection, with stronger protective effects in patients with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/l [91] .

Humans primarily obtain vitamin D from solar exposure and from the diet. Solar ultraviolet B radiation converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, which is rapidly converted to vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 from the skin or the diet is further converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin-D which circulates in serum and is used to determine the vitamin D status. Lung epithelial cells and immune cells can convert the circulating, inactive, 25-hydroxyvitamin-D to its active form, 1,25(OH) 2 D or calcitriol, which can engage the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) and mediate its myriad of actions [92, 93, 94] , revealing an important health problem and the underscoring the possibility of intervention by vitamin D supplementation. The immediate consequence of nuclear VDR ligation is the heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor and the binding to vitamin D responsive elements in promoter regions of responsive genes. These genes include CAMP and DEFB4, which correspond to human cationic antimicrobial peptide of 18 KDa (hCAP-18/LL-37) and β-Defensin-2 (HBD2) of which both are HDPs [95] . Induction of LL-37 by vitamin D has been reported in several cell types, including lung epithelial cells, and of relevance, calcitriol (1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 ) delivery to human primary bronchial epithelial cells (HPBEC) 24 h prior to RV-16 infection proved sufficient to reduce viral replication by 2.8-fold in comparison to untreated cells [86] . This effect was also observed in cells from cystic fibrosis patients with a twofold reduction in virus. Importantly, CAMP but not DEFB4 mRNA expression was increased by vitamin D, and exogenous delivery of 20 μg/ml of recombinant LL-37 recapitulated the antiviral effects observed with vitamin D delivery. A subsequent study validated the antiviral effect of calcitriol pretreatment on the RV1B serotype, reducing both viral RNA and virion release from HPBEC [87] . These two studies show that calcitriol induces LL-37 and that > 20 μg/ml of exogenous LL-37 have a direct antiviral effect on RV, an activity that is conserved to other mammal cathelicidins [82] . future science group www.futuremedicine.com

When a complex and physiological model of fully differentiated HPBEC in an air-liquid interface was used to address the effects of calcitriol on RV16 replication, no reduction in viral load was observed [96] . However, clear effects on cell morphology and replication were noted. While the doses of calcitriol used in this study were lower (10 nM) than above mentioned studies, these differences underscore the importance of the cell and delivery system used to study vitamin D effects. In this regard, daily delivery of 2 μg of calcitriol in tablet form for 1 week failed to significantly increase nasal LL-37 concentrations in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving healthy or asthmatic subjects [97] . Interestingly, the same group reported that exposing fully differentiated HPBEC to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, prior to vitamin D treatment, lessened the induction of LL-37. This reduced the overall antimicrobial effects of vitamin D due to an alteration in the metabolic pathway [98] . These observations indicate that further work in this area is required, particularly in the context of chronic inflammatory lung diseases, as this finding could limit the benefits of vitamin D supplementation strategies.

Upregulation of endogenous HDP production or the delivery of exogenous cathelicidins or synthetic analogs represents novel and exciting therapeutic strategies for protecting and treating human RV infections. There is therefore a need to further investigate the mechanisms behind their ability to inhibit viral infections, and to further establish the antiRV activity of other families of peptides, including defensins. Understanding how these small peptides operate could support the development of novel therapeutic strategies for RV and possibly other viral infections.

Modulation or targeting of host molecules responsible for facilitating infection and viral replication may also provide a valuable therapeutic avenue for the therapeutic treatment of RV. One area of interest has focused upon the innate antiviral response, which results in broad range protection from infection, and was attributed to interferons [99] . Purification and further study of interferons found that they were devoid of inherent antiviral activity, but stimulated the production of other antiviral molecules [100, 101] , which led coining of the phrase 'antiviral state'. Upon recognition of pathogens by cellular sensors including TLRs and RLRs, the type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) are some of the earliest immune mediators to be produced (reviewed in [102] ). Their subsequent binding to the interferon receptor induces expression of several interferon-stimulated genes, resulting in powerful antiviral and immunomodulatory effects to limit infection [103] . Features of this induced antiviral state include resistance to viral replication, induction of apoptotic cell death and increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I in infected cells. Interferons also have an impact on immune cells, activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and stimulating NK cells to enhance their cytolytic activity [104] . This multifaceted, broad-spectrum protection is key to successful antiviral responses.

Recent studies have shown that RV is detected by different sensors on or within the host cell; components of the capsid are detected by TLR2; ssRNA genome is detected by TLR7/8 and dsRNA generated during viral replication is detected by TLR3 in endosomes or RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol [105, 106] . TLR3 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells, whereas RIG-I and MDA5 are upregulated in response to infection [107, 108] . Importantly, gene silencing any of the dsRNA sensors using siRNA reduces the cytokine response and increases RV replication, suggesting a coordinated role for multiple sensors in antiviral responses to RV [109] . In this context, mice lacking TLR3 exhibit higher loads of RNA viruses and decreased production of type I IFN compared with wild-type mice [110, 111] . Significantly, a case study reported that a child harboring a homozygous missense mutation in the gene IFIH1, which encodes for MDA5, was highly susceptible to recurrent and life-threatening RV infections [112] . This gene mutation resulted in failure to recognize MDA5-ligands associated with RV infection, leading to reduced IFN production and therefore increased susceptibility to RV.

In vitro studies have shown that exogenous delivery of 0.1-10 ng/ml interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ1 or IFN-λ2) reduced RV1A viral copies in HPBECs [113] . Interestingly, the exogenous addition of IFN-β also suppressed RV16 and RV1B replication in HPBECs isolated from healthy and asthmatic individuals [114, 115, 116, 117] . However, exogenous IFN delivery can also potentially impact the already elevated cytokine levels found during RV infection [113] , thus caution must be exercised with this therapeutic strategy.

Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, commonly referred to as Poly I:C, is a dsRNA structure that mimics intermediates generated during viral replication. When sensed by TLR-3 or cytoplasmic RLR sensors (MAD5 and RIG-I), Poly I:C induces a strong interferon response, and prophylactic administration of Poly I:C in vitro or in vivo can enhance protection against a number of viral infections, including several strains of RV [118, 119, 120, 121] .

In addition to regulating the interferon response, Poly I:C is a powerful inducer of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and has been linked to maturation of DCs, NK cell cytotoxicity and virus-specific T-cell responses [122, 123] . This amplification of innate and adaptive immunity provides protection against a range of viruses, including influenza, Rift Valley fever virus, rabies virus, SARS-Co-BV and RSV [124, 125, 126, 127, 128] . Data from our own laboratory has shown that pretreatment of bronchial epithelial cells with 10 μg/ml of Poly I:C substantially affects RV RV1B replication (Figure 1) .

Drugs based on Poly I:C or derivatives are being developed as broad-spectrum antivirals and potential adjuvants for DC-targeted vaccines. Poly I:C stabilized with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose, known as poly-ICLC, has shown efficacy against viruses such as influenza [129] and is also being tested in an HIV vaccine trial (Oncovir, Inc. and Dalton Pharma Services, ON, Canada). PIKA (NewBiomed PIKA Pte Ltd, Singapore), a chemically stabilized analog of Poly I:C also reduced influenza virus load in the lungs of infected mice [130] . While its antiviral effects hold promise for treatment of RV infection, delivery of Poly I:C can, in some instances, lead to increased bacterial replication (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) and impaired clearance from the lungs due to prolonged interferon signaling [131, 132] . Given that RV is frequently associated with increased secondary bacterial infections, especially in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other underlying morbidities, further work is required to determine whether Poly I:C or stabilized analogs are safe as antiviral therapeutics for RV infection.

A further therapeutic strategy may be targeting of host factors that have been identified as important in the context of RV replication. For example, both oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III β (PI4KB), have been identified as host proteins involved in picornavirus replication [133, 134, 135] , and studies focusing upon chemical inhibition of PI4KB with a panel of aminothiazoles have demonstrated potent inhibition of RV [136] . Equally, novel enviroxime-like compounds as well as other compounds such as itraconozole (mentioned above) which can target OSBP have also shown promise in inhibiting viral replication [61, 62, 134, 137] . Furthermore, as both PI4KB and OSBP can act as substrates for protein kinase D (PKD), recent studies have identified PKD as a key molecule in RV replication and have demonstrated that PKD inhibition can profoundly affect RV replication at an early stage [138] . Interestingly, the lipid-modifying enzyme PLA2G16 has recently been described as playing a role in picornavirus replication through enhanced viral protein synthesis [139] . Of note, a very recent study reported that a novel compound, termed IMP-1088, showed potent inhibitory activity towards multiple strains of RV at nanomolar concentrations. This particular compound blocked viral replication by targeting the host cell N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2, which are required for the assembly of the viral capsid [140] . Thus, therapeutic options targeting inhibition or functional modulation of these enzymes, or others involved in viral protein synthesis, may be of value.

Neutralizing antibodies RV ssRNA genome is contained within an icosahedral protein capsid comprised of four structural proteins; three are surface exposed (VP1, VP2 and VP3), and VP4 is buried [141] . RV-specific neutralizing antibodies have been developed against epitopes found on VP proteins that aim to block virus-receptor interaction, stabilize the capsid preventing viral uncoating, or cause conformational changes in the capsid inducing premature genome release [142, 143, 144] . Other studies have shown that antibodies raised against VP4, specifically the N terminus, had RV neutralizing activity and, indeed, may be a promising target for therapeutic development [145, 146] . Another approach has been to develop antibodies that bind to the host cell receptors, thereby blocking entry of RV. Targeting ICAM-1 in transgenic mice engineered to overexpress extracellular domains 1 and 2 of human ICAM-1 has been shown to prevent the entry of two major groups of RV, RV16 and RV14. Reduced cellular inflammation, proinflammatory cytokine production and virus load was also observed in this model [147] . However, targeting and blockage of other receptors used by minor group RV, such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, has proved elusive. This is also the case in the context of the development of a universal 'anti-RV' antibody, which is problematic due to the antigenic diversity of circulating RV. Thus, there remain significant challenges associated with the identification of new antigenic variants and the fact that around 90% of RV serotypes cannot bind to the murine ICAM-1 receptor.

Development of antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of other viral infections has been recently reviewed with several antibodies undergoing preclinical development or in clinical trials for newly emerging viral pathogens such as Ebola as well as long standing pathogens such as influenza [148] . At present there are no licensed antibodies for clinical use in RV infection, underscoring the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. future science group www.futuremedicine.com

An effective licensed therapeutic treatment for RV remains elusive, despite several decades of intensive work that has aimed to characterize the activity of a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic compounds against this infection. The answer to this problem may lie in manipulation of the host cell response with a view to inhibiting RV replication and spread. For example, one recent study that screened 50,000 potential antiviral structures, and subsequently identified and analyzed the compound FA-613 found that it interferes with intracellular pyrimidine synthesis pathways [149] . Furthermore, the addition of FA-613 to virus-infected cells induced the elevated expression of antiviral genes, leading to inhibition of RV, influenza, RSV and coronavirus replication. This is an example of a host-cell focused strategy that could yield promising results in the future. Another way forward could be the use of peptides that are able to act by blocking receptors, such as ICAM-1 and LDL, essential for RV binding and entry. Cathelicidins can inactivate nonenveloped viruses, such as adenovirus, and optimal inhibition of RV replication occurs when the virus is directly exposed to the peptide, suggesting that peptide binding to a component of the capsid is occurring [70, 82] . At present, virtually nothing is known about the determinants for cathelicidin binding to the viral capsid and a full understanding of this will require fine mapping of cathelicidin binding sites and identification of the active peptide region.

Many of the therapeutics described herein have been under investigation for decades, but the challenges posed by this particular pathogen have, thus far, been insurmountable. Encouragingly, a new wave of antiviral peptides and compounds has been characterized over the past 2-3 years, and thus the potential for developing novel and effective treatments for targeting RV infection may be closer than ever before ( Figure 2 ).

Human rhinoviruses • Human rhinoviruses (RVs) are the primary etiological agents of the common cold, but can cause serious illness and increased hospital admissions in immunocompromised individuals or those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

• Cathelicidins from a number of mammalian species possess antiviral activity toward RV.

• Vitamin D metabolites can upregulate host defense molecules and in vitro supplementation in models of RV infection has been reported to reduce viral replication.

• Identification of host molecules required for viral replication can provide novel targets for antiviral therapy and compounds that can target these host factors have been shown to affect RV replication. Future perspective • Investigation of novel capsid binding compounds or peptides will likely be a key determinant in finding an effective therapeutic for RV.

Recombinant Infectious Bronchitis Viruses Expressing Chimeric Spike Glycoproteins Induce Partial Protective Immunity against Homologous Challenge despite Limited Replication In Vivo VACCINES AND ANTIVIRAL AGENTS crossm,"Vaccination regimes against Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which are based on a single virus serotype, often induce insufficient levels of cross-protection against serotypes and two or more antigenically diverse vaccines are used in attempt to provide broader protection. Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, are associated with poor cross-protection. Here, homologous vaccination trials with recombinant IBVs (rIBVs), based on the apathogenic strain, BeauR, were conducted to elucidate the role of S1 in protection. A single vaccination of specific-pathogen-free chickens with rIBV expressing S1 of virulent strains M41 or QX, BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1), gave incomplete protection against homologous challenge, based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. There could be conformational issues with the spike if heterologous S1 and S2 are linked, suggesting a homologous S2 might be essential. To address this, a homologous vaccinationchallenge trial incorporating rIBVs expressing full spike from M41, BeauR-M41(S), and S2 subunit from M41, BeauR-M41(S2) was conducted. All chimeric viruses grew to similar titers in vitro, induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, evident by cellular infiltrations, reductions in viral RNA load in the trachea and conjunctiva and higher serum anti-IBV titers. Collectively, these findings show that vaccination with rIBVs primed the birds for challenge but the viruses were cleared rapidly from the mucosal tissues in the head. Chimeric S1 and S2 viruses did not protect as effectively as BeauR-M41(S) based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, responsible for significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Amino acid differences in the surface protein, spike (S), in particular the S1 subunit, have been associated with poor cross-protection. Available vaccines give poor cross-protection and rationally designed live attenuated vaccines, based on apathogenic BeauR, could address these. Here, to determine the role of S1 in protection, a series of homologous vaccination trials with rIBVs were conducted. Single vaccinations with chimeric rIBVs induced virus-specific partial protective immunity, characterized by reduction in viral load and serum antibody titers. However, BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccination to improve the level of protection against clinical signs and the loss of tracheal ciliary activity. Growth characteristics show that all of the rIBVs replicated in vitro to similar levels. Booster vaccinations and an rIBV with improved in vivo replication may improve the levels of protection.","I nfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is classified as a Gammacoronavirus, subfamily Coronavirinae, order Nidovirales (1) . IBV is responsible for major economic losses to poultry industries worldwide as a result of poor weight gain, decreased egg production, and impaired egg quality. The effect of IBV on the ciliary activity in the trachea and the immune system may predispose infected chickens to secondary infections with opportunistic bacteria, which often increases the mortality rate associated with IBV (2) (3) (4) .

IBV is an enveloped virus, with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (ϳ28 kb) and encodes four structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein envelope (E), and integral membrane protein (M) (5, 6) . The major surface protein of IBV, S, is a type 1 glycoprotein which oligomerizes to form trimers (7) and is thought to be the main inducer of protective immunity (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The S protein is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, the N-terminal subunit S1 (approximately 500 to 550 amino acids, 90 kDa) and the C-terminal subunit, S2 (630 amino acids, 84 kDa), which contains the transmembrane domain. The S1 subunit plays a critical role in binding to cellular receptors since it contains the receptor binding domain (13, 14) , determines the virus serotype, and is responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (14) (15) (16) . Multiple studies have shown that recombinant S1 expressed in adenovirus and Newcastle disease virus vectors can induce a certain level of protection in specified-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens against challenge with wildtype virus (11, 17, 18) .

Vaccine programs against IBV often include a combination of live or inactivated vaccines which are based on several dominant field serotypes of the virus. The current vaccines often induce insufficient cross-protection, and combinations of antigenically different vaccines are used in an effort to improve levels of protection (19) . Alongside this, with the continual emergence of new field strains the control of IBV is persistently a significant problem to the poultry industry. A reverse genetics system based on the avirulent strain of IBV Beaudette has been developed (20, 21) . This system has many potential applications, such as to enhance our understanding of the role of individual genes in pathogenicity and to lead to a new generation of rationally designed live attenuated vaccines (20) . Previous work using the reverse genetics approach demonstrated that replacement of the ectodomain of the S glycoprotein of the apathogenic IBV Beaudette strain with the same region from either of two pathogenic IBV strains, M41-CK or 4/91, resulted in two nonvirulent rIBVs, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-4/91(S), respectively. Notably, both rIBVs based on the BeauR backbone acquired the same cell tropism of that of the donor S, M41-CK or 4/91 (22, 23) . Other work demonstrated that the Beaudette S2 subunit confers the unique ability of Beaudette to replicate in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, a continuous cell line licensed for vaccine production (24, 25) . Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) or BeauR-4/91(S) can confer protection against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity, reductions in clinical signs and viral load in the trachea at 5 days postchallenge (dpc), further demonstrating the dominant role of the S glycoprotein in inducing protective immunity (23, 26) .

In this study, we investigated the protection conferred against homologous challenge by two rIBVs, BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1), that contain S1 subunits from economically relevant strains, M41 and QX, respectively, with the S2 subunit derived from BeauR (Fig. 1) . Notably both rIBVs have the advantageous ability to replicate in Vero cells (26; E. Bickerton et al., unpublished data) due to the presence of the Beaudette S2 subunit. We report here on the first application of rIBV with a chimeric S gene to be used in a vaccination trial. The rIBV BeauR-M41(S2) was also investigated in order to elucidate the relevant roles of both subunits in protective immunity. While the S1 subunit is considered to be immunodominant, the S2 subunit is highly conserved between strains and contains immunogenic regions (14, 27) .

We have shown here that vaccination with a recombinant IBV expressing a chimeric S gene can induce a partially protective response against challenge, as assessed by viral load, cellular infiltration, clinical signs, and a boost in serum antibody titers postchallenge. Vaccination with rIBV expressing homologous S1 and S2 subunits (i.e., full S gene) in the Beaudette backbone induced partial protection classified by the level of ciliary activity and presence of clinical signs following challenge with wild-type IBV. Comparison of in vitro growth characteristics shows that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro. However, our data show that despite the ability to induce a degree of virus-specific protective immunity, the rIBVs are hindered by limited in vivo replication and the attenuated BeauR backbone. cellular infiltrates in both the Harderian gland and the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) at 2 dpv ( Fig. 3A to D), with areas of CALT more prominent in vaccinated tissues compared to mock-treated samples (Mock) (Fig. 3E) . Collectively, these findings suggest that the recombinant vaccine viruses did infect these tissues but were no longer detectable by PCR at 2 dpv, suggesting rapid clearance from the sites of inoculation and mucosal tissues in the head-associated lymphoid tissues exerted by a virus-specific protective immune response.

To elucidate whether BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1) were able to confer a degree of protection against homologous challenge, as evidenced by a reduction in viral load in infected tissues postchallenge, qPCR was conducted to assess the level of viral RNA in the trachea and CALT. At 2 dpc, the IBV viral RNA loads in both the trachea and the CALT were significantly lower in the BeauR-M41(S1)-vaccinated groups than in the challenge controls ( Fig. 4A and C), but at 4 dpc the viral RNA load was only significantly lower in the CALT of the BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated group ( Fig. 4B and D) . The infectious viral load determined by titration of trachea tissue supernatant in tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) showed a reduction in infectious virions recovered from BeauR-M41(S1)-and BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated chickens, although this reduction was not significant compared to corresponding wild-type controls [BeauR-M41(S1), P ϭ 0.961; BeauR-QX(S1), P ϭ 0.999] (Fig. 4E ). The wild-type control groups were the only groups to report significantly higher infectious viral loads recovered from the trachea compared to those of the Mock/Mock controls (Fig. 4E) .

Serum IBV-specific antibodies were assessed postvaccination (prechallenge) at 21 dpv and at 2, 4, and 14 dpc. Compared to the challenge control group, titers were significantly higher in the BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated group at 2 and 4 dpc ( Fig. 5A and B) (P Ͻ 0.05 and P Ͻ 0.01, respectively). At 14 dpc, serum titers were higher in both the BeauR-M41(S1)-and BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated groups compared to the challenge con- (27) , wherein a bird is deemed protected against ciliostasis if no fewer than 9 of 10 tracheal rings per bird show normal ciliary activity (Ͼ50% ciliary activity retained). c A vaccine is considered efficacious at conferring protection against ciliostasis when 80% or more of the birds in a group were protected. NA, not applicable. trol groups, but only the QX-vaccinated group was significantly higher compared to the corresponding challenge control group ( Fig. 5C and D) (P Ͻ 0.05). For both vaccinated groups, antibody titers at 21 dpv (prechallenge) could be classed as ""borderline"" positive due to being above the limits of the S/P cutoff ( Fig. 5C and D) .

In summary, results from trial 1 suggest that although vaccination of the chickens with BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-QX(S1) did not confer complete protection against homologous challenge based on clinical signs and ciliary activity, a single vaccination of young chickens induced a partially protective virus-specific immune response, as indicated by a significant reduction in the viral load in the trachea and the CALT. Higher IBV-specific serum antibody titers compared to challenge-only controls shows that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs was able to prime the birds for challenge. Whether the lack of full protection against the loss of ciliary activity and clinical signs was due to the absence of a homologous S2 subunit or an incorrect folding of M41/QX (S1) and BeauR rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology (S2)-and therefore lower infectivity-could not be answered in this study. Therefore, a second trial addressing the issue of whether a homologous S2 is required for protection was conducted. Relative contribution of S1 and S2 to homologous protection. In trial 2, the rIBVs used were BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) (described in Fig. 1) , with an experimental design similar to that used for trial 1. No clinical signs were observed in any of the vaccinated groups after vaccination (data not shown). After vaccination, there was no loss of ciliary activity in the trachea, indicating the apathogenicity of the rIBVs (data not shown). Similar to trial 1, at 21 dpv the chickens were challenged with M41-CK. Clinical signs were observed until 7 dpc; BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccinated group to show less prevalent clinical signs postchallenge compared to the M41-CK challenge control ( Fig. 6A and B). There was little difference between the BeauR-M41(S1), BeauR-M41(S2), and M41-CK groups in terms of the presence and severity of clinical signs ( Fig. 6A and B ), but in the vaccinated groups clinical signs resolved more rapidly compared to the M41-CK controls. Ciliary activity was assessed at 4 dpc, and FIG 5 Measurement of serum anti-IBV titers of BeauR-M41(S1)-and BeauR-QX(S1)-vaccinated groups. Serum titers were assessed by commercial ELISA at 2 dpc (A) and 4 dpc (B) and in M41 groups at 14 dpc (C) and QX groups at 14 dpc (D). Prechallenge titers (i.e., 21 dpv) are included in panels C and D. The mean S/P Ϯ the standard deviation from each group (n ϭ 5 to 10) and includes four technical replicates/animal.

Noteworthy, assessment on an individual bird level showed that three of five birds in the BeauR-M41(S) were classed as ""protected against ciliostasis""; however, since the group average was 60%, this does not translate into protection on a group level ( Table 2 ). Viral RNA loads in the tracheas and CALTs isolated from challenged chickens were determined by qPCR to elucidate whether the S1 and S2 subunits played any further role in conferring protection. At 2 dpc only the CALT from BeauR-M41(S)-and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens showed any significant reduction (P Ͻ 0.001) in viral RNA load compared to the challenge control (Fig. 7A) . However, at 4 dpc all groups had significantly lower viral RNA loads in the CALT ( [P Ͻ 0.05, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-M41(S2), P Ͻ 0.01, BeauR-M41(S1)]. Failure to locate the rIBVs in the head-associated lymphoid and respiratory tissues at 2 dpv in trial 1 led to the inclusion of the 1-dpv time point in trial 2. BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) were detected by RT-PCR in a number of the Harderian glands and tracheas isolated from chickens at 1 dpv; however, at 2 and 4 dpv the rIBVs were mainly detected in the nasal turbinates (Table 3) , suggesting rapid clearance of rIBVs from the mucosal head tissues and sites of inoculation. Although the titers of infectious challenge virus recovered from tracheas at 4 dpc were not significantly reduced in BeauR-M41(S)-, BeauR-M41(S1)-, and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens compared to controls (because of the variation within each group), there was a general trend that vaccination resulted in a reduction in viral infectivity, with no detected infectious virus recovered in four of five birds in the S group, three of five birds in the S1 group, and one of five birds in the S2 group (Fig. 7E ). Collectively, this shows that the chimeric rIBVs are able to induce a degree of local protection against the replication of IBV in the trachea.

To assess whether the rIBVs induced humoral antibody responses following vaccination with BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) viruses, IBV-specific serum titers were assessed at 2 and 4 dpc. At 2 dpc, there was clear evidence of a boost in antibody titers in the BeauR-M41(S)-and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated groups (Fig. 8A) , with significantly higher titers compared to Mock/M41 controls (P Ͻ 0.001). IBV induced antibody titers at 2 dpc in BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated chickens were higher than those from BeauR-M41(S1)-and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens across the dilution series (Fig. 8A) . At 4 dpc, serum antibody titers from all vaccinated groups were significantly (27), wherein bird is deemed protected against ciliostasis if no fewer than 9 of 10 tracheal rings per bird showed normal ciliary activity (Ͼ50% ciliary activity retained). c The vaccine is considered to be efficacious at conferring protection against ciliostasis when 80% or more of the birds in a group were protected. NA, not applicable.

higher compared to the Mock/M41 titers (Fig. 8B) , an observation suggestive of a primed antibody response in the vaccinated chickens. The serum antibody titers at 14 dpc indicated no significant differences between the vaccinated groups and the challenge-only controls (Fig. 8C ), suggesting that a boosted response was lacking in response to challenge with wild-type virus.

The virus neutralization activity of the serum collected at 4 and 14 dpc were assessed, and at 4 dpc there was no neutralization of the virus detected (data not shown). At 14 dpc, only serum from BeauR-M41(S)-and BeauR-M41(S1)-vaccinated chickens had significantly higher neutralization activity of the virus compared to Mock/Mock controls (P ϭ 0.002 and P ϭ 0.0066, respectively; Fig. 9A ). BeauR-M41(S) vaccination induced significantly higher virus neutralization titers compared to BeauR- 

Following on from the observation of differences during the in vivo vaccination trials, to elucidate whether the inclusion of a chimeric S gene or a foreign S gene had an effect on viral replication, the replication kinetics of rIBV BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), and BeauR-M41(S2) viruses were investigated in vitro. At 12 h postinfection (hpi) all viruses had similar titers ( Fig. 10A and B) . This suggests that the inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene has not impeded replication in vitro in either chicken kidney cells (CKCs) derived from Valo chickens (Fig. 10A) or CKCs derived from Rhode Island Red (RIR) birds (Fig. 10B) . Single-step growth curves performed in CKCs derived from RIR birds show that over the latent period (2 to 8 hpi), there were lower virus titers for BeauR-M41(S2) compared to the other viruses; however, when exponential growth was compared, there was no statistical difference between the viruses (Fig. 10C) . The titers of BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-M41(S1) were similar across all time points (Fig. 10C ).

We have previously shown that rIBVs expressing the ectodomain of the Spike protein of a pathogenic strain in the context of an apathogenic strain BeauR could induce increased levels of protection against homologous and partially against heterologous challenge infection. Here, we extended this work and replaced only the S1 subunit of the ectodomain of BeauR with the S1 domain of M41 or QX, representing two strains that circulate in poultry flocks worldwide. These rIBVs have the advantage rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology of being able to replicate in Vero cells, potentially allowing large-scale vaccine production in cell culture rather than in embryonated eggs. In this first vaccination study, using a single dose of BeauR-M41(S1) or BeauR-QX(S1) in 1-week-old chicks, the birds were not protected against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Vaccination with BeauR-QX(S1) induced significantly higher serum titers postchallenge, and the clinical signs associated with challenge virus, although present, decreased rapidly compared to unvaccinated birds challenged with QX. Together, these data show that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs are able to induce a degree of virus-specific immunity with partial local protection in the mucosal head tissues and the primary site of replication, the trachea.

To address the questions of whether a full homologous S is required for optimal folding, virus replication, and protection using an apathogenic recombinant virus, a second vaccination experiment was performed. One-week-old birds were immunized once with BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), or BeauR-M41(S2). Replacement of the apathogenic BeauR-S1 or S2 subunits with a S1 or S2 from a pathogenic strain, allowed BeauR to remain apathogenic, suggesting that the S1 or S2 alone do not play a role in the pathogenicity of IBV. This further expands our previous work showing that spike switching of BeauR-S with M41-S had no effect on pathogenicity (23) . Here, vaccination of chickens with a rIBV based on a BeauR backbone expressing a full S gene from the donor serotype enhanced the level of protection afforded against tracheal ciliostasis, with three of five birds classed as fully protected. However, when classified under European Pharmacopeia standards for assessment of IBV vaccines (28), at which 80% protection (at a group level) against ciliostasis is required, the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group was only able to confer partial protection (ϳ60%) and therefore is still not satisfactory for the criteria used for the assessment of IBV vaccines for industrial application. Consistent with previously published work, we show that collectively as a group the chickens vaccinated via ocular-nasal routes with BeauR-M41(S) had ϳ60% ciliary activity remaining, a reduction in clinical signs, and viral load postchallenge (26) . The protection seen at the trachea may potentially be improved with assessment of ciliostasis at a later time point, as Armesto et al. (23) reported that vaccination with BeauR-4/91(S) gave ϳ60% ciliary activity at 4 dpc, which then improved to 90 to 100% at 6 dpc. In trial 1 the viral RNA load in the trachea and CALT from the S1-vaccinated groups was reduced at 2 dpc, whereas in trial 2 all vaccinated groups had a clear significant reduction in viral RNA loads at 2 and 4 dpc in the trachea and CALT. The qPCR used here is designed to detect the 5= untranslated region (5= UTR) of the genome (29) , and it therefore may be detecting incomplete virions or challenge virus captured in the lumen of the trachea. To further support the viral RNA load data, infectious viral load recovered from the trachea in both trials 1 and 2 were lower in rIBV-vaccinated chickens, indicating a degree of local protection at the site of infection, which was not robust enough to completely protect against viral replication in vivo and the loss of ciliary activity.

The major surface glycoprotein of coronaviruses, spike, is a type 1 glycoprotein and has two structurally distinct conformations: prefusion and postfusion (30) (31) (32) . In the coronavirus replication cycle, the spike mediates the critical steps of receptor binding and membrane fusion. Upon binding of the S1 receptor binding domain to the host cell, an irreversible conformational switch to the postfusion state allows the S2 subunit to fuse viral and cellular membranes, facilitating entry of the viral genome and therefore downstream viral replication (32) (33) (34) . Recently, the crystal structure of the prefusion spike from mouse hepatitis virus and human coronavirus (HKU1) were resolved, highlighting the critical role that the interaction between the trimers of S1 and S2 plays in stabilization of the prefusion conformation of spike (31, 32) . Here, expression of a chimeric spike in a recombinant IBV backbone with the lack of a homologous S2 possibly resulted in conformational changes either within the S1 subunit or complete S protein, potentially affecting receptor binding and entry, but may have also altered immunogenic epitopes. The S2 subunits of BeauR shares 87 and 97% amino acid sequence similarities with QX and M41-CK, respectively, showing that there are only a few different amino acid residues between them. The interactions between S1 and S2 subunits are critical for the maintenance of conformation, recognition, and efficient fusion of the spike to host cells; it has been consistently shown that even a single amino acid change within the S2 subunit of coronavirus spikes may influence the secondary structure of the overall spike or the S1 subunit (35, 36) .

The development of a cryo-electron microscopic structure of IBV M41 spike, highlighting the evolutionary difference between the prefusion spike structures of IBV compared to betacoronaviruses and alphacoronaviruses, nonetheless indicates a high degree of structurally similarity to porcine deltacoronavirus (37, 38) . This structural model of prefusion IBV spike will significantly aid in addressing the challenges over whether (i) expression of a chimeric spike in a rIBV backbone causes conformational changes either within the S1 subunit or complete S or (ii) it is vital that homologous ""matched"" S1 and S2 and their interactions are required to maintain the correct prefusion conformation of spike, as suggested in other coronaviruses.

The Beaudette strain, used here in the reverse genetics system, has an extended in vitro tropism, ability to grow in cell cultures and an apathogenic nature, making it an excellent resource for the investigation of heterologous genes and growth characteristics of rIBV. During embryo passages, however, the Beaudette strain may have acquired mutations which are likely to contribute to its lack of pathogenicity and restrict its in vivo tropism and replication. Replacement of the BeauR S1 or S2 with corresponding subunits from a pathogenic strain did not indicate a significant impairment of in vitro growth of the viruses in comparison to the BeauR virus, showing no indication that BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-M41(S2) were unable to enter the cells, fuse with cell membranes, or fail to replicate in vitro. Nevertheless, the lack of full protection afforded by BeauR rIBVs against wild-type challenge and the limited in vivo replication strongly suggest that attenuations have occurred in genes playing an essential role in replication and that these are negatively impacting its suitability as a vaccine vector. Development of an alternative, less-attenuated backbone for the expression of heter-ologous genes in rIBVs may promote the development of these live attenuated vaccines for the control of IBV.

Expression of the IBV S1 subunit alone has been shown to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, albeit often requiring repeated vaccination (8, 10) . Here, immunization of chickens with rIBVs based on the Beaudette backbone expressing either M41 S or chimeric S1/S2 induced virus-neutralizing antibodies; however, the Mock/M41 serum also had a degree of neutralizing activity. BeauR-M41(S) vaccinated chickens had significantly higher virus neutralizing titers than the BeauR-M41(S2) group, but there was no statistical difference with the BeauR-M41(S1) group, showing that neutralizing antibodies are induced following a single vaccination with rIBV expressing M41(S1).

Live attenuated vaccines against IBV need to induce a good level of mucosal immunity, with local tracheal and cell-mediated immunity also playing an important role in prevention of IBV infection (39) (40) (41) . As discussed earlier, the BeauR backbone is impeded by poor in vivo replication, and the lack of protection shown against ciliostasis indicates that there is a poor level of local immunity induced in the trachea by vaccination with BeauR rIBVs. Cytotoxic responses can also play a key role in the early control of IBV, as indicated by previous studies showing NK cell activation (42), IBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell-lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes isolated from IBV-infected chickens (41) , and higher CTL proportions in respiratory tissues following IBV infection (43) . Cellular infiltrates in head-associated lymphoid tissues, as well as a reduction in viral load in the trachea and CALT, also imply that the rIBVs infected the chickens and suggests a possible role for the cell-mediated response. However, that we were unable to consistently detect the recombinant S1 viruses at 2 dpv raises possibilities that the viruses were either rapidly cleared from the tissues, replicate poorly at these sites of inoculation, or have limited replication in a few cells which are below detectable limits of the assays. In the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group, more than 50% of the chickens were positive for vaccine virus, as assessed by RT-PCR, in the Harderian gland and nasal turbinates at 1 and 2 dpv, respectively. The primary site of IBV infection is thought to be the ciliated epithelium lining the trachea; however, following ocularnasal vaccination, the virus has been detected in the nasal turbinates (44) and Harderian gland (45) .

One possible explanation for the poor protection of ciliary activity afforded by the recombinant S1 viruses could be that we only administered a single vaccine dose to the SPF chicks. Previous studies using baculovirus expressed IBV recombinant proteins or IBV purified proteins have required multiple injections to achieve a degree of protection in SPF chickens (10, 17) . There is also evidence of an impaired humoral response in young chicks with regard to IBV vaccination; vaccination of 1-and 7-day-old chicks showed a delay in both systemic and local IgA and IgG levels compared to vaccination of older chicks (14, 21, or 28 days old) (46) . Here, in an attempt to improve the protection against respiratory signs and ciliostasis with the recombinant S1 viruses, a prime-boost approach may aid in overcoming these potential issues.

In summary, we have previously generated recombinant IBV based on a BeauR backbone expressing a heterologous S1 from M41 or QX, and in the present study we have shown that a single vaccination in young chicks with these rIBVs, although not adequate to completely prevent ciliostasis and clinical signs, can induce a degree of virus-specific protective immunity. This was characterized by a reduction in the viral load recovered from the trachea and CALT, cellular infiltrations at head mucosal and inoculation sites, higher serum antibody titers in vaccinated groups, and the induction of virus-neutralizing activity. Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S), despite expressing the homologous full S to attempt to overcome any issues with heterologous S1 and S2 subunits and suboptimal folding, only induce a partially protection against the loss of ciliary activity. Since the in vitro growth characteristics show that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro, perhaps the attenuated Beaudette backbone has hindered the in vivo replication of these rIBVs; thus, to improve protection, multiple vaccinations, or an alternative backbone may be required.

Ethics statement. All animal experimental protocols were carried out in strict accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines and under license granted for experiments involving regulated procedures on animals protected under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The experiments were performed in The Pirbright Institute (TPI) Home Office licensed (X24684464) experimental animal house facilities and were approved by TPI's animal welfare and ethical review committee under the terms of reference HO-ERP-01-1. Trial 1 used SPF RIR chickens obtained from TPI Poultry Production Unit in Compton. Trial 2 used the same chicken breed but obtained from The National Avian Research Facility in Edinburgh.

Cells and viruses. Tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were prepared from 19-day-old SPF RIR chicken embryos (47) (48) (49) . Primary chicken kidney (CK) cells were prepared by The Central Services Unit, TPI, from kidneys extracted from either 2-to 3-week-old SPF RIR chickens or 2-week-old SPF derived Valo chickens (49) . The pathogenic M41 strain (50) used in this study had previously been adapted in CK cells to produce M41-CK (accession number X04722) (26) . The pathogenic strain, QX (QX L1148 strain, accession number KY933090) (51) , was donated by Richard Jones, University of Liverpool. The rIBVs BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), BeauR-M41(S2), and BeauR-QX(S1) used here are described in a schematic illustration (Fig. 1) and constructed using the backbone of Beau-R, which is the molecular clone of Beau-CK (accession number AJ311317) (21, 25) . All isolates of IBV and rIBV were propagated in 10-day-old RIR SPF embryonated eggs. Allantoic fluid was clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 24 to 48 hpi. Titrations to determine virus infectivity were either performed in TOCs as described previously (26) or in CK cells (49) ; titers are expressed as 50% (median) ciliostatic doses (CD 50 )/ml or PFU/ml, respectively.

Analysis of growth kinetics in CK cells. Confluent CK cells seeded in either 6-well or 12-well plates were inoculated with 10 4 PFU rIBV or IBV for multistep growth curves or 10 5 PFU rIBV or IBV for single-step growth curves in 0.5 ml of serum-free N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2aminoethanesulphonic acid (BES) medium and incubated for 1 h at 37°C at 5% CO 2 . Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual virus, and 2 ml of serum-free BES medium was added per well. Extracellular virus was harvested at defined intervals and assayed by titration in CK cells.

Experimental design of in vivo vaccination/challenge trials. SPF RIR chickens were housed in positive-pressure, HEPA-filtered isolation rooms in which each group was housed in a separate room. In two separate experiments, birds were randomly divided into 5 groups of 30 birds for trial 1 and 5 groups of 40 birds for trial 2. Eight-day-old chicks were inoculated (classified as primary inoculation) with 10 5 PFU of BeauR-M41(S1) or BeauR-QX(S1) (trial 1) or 10 4 PFU BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), or BeauR-M41(S2) (trial 2) in a total of 0.1 ml of PBS via conjunctival (eye drop) and intranasal routes. A challenge dose, equal to the primary inoculation, 10 5 PFU (trial 1) and 10 4 PFU (trial 2) of the corresponding wild-type viruses were administered in the same manner 21 days after the primary inoculation to the appropriate groups. Of note, the IBV QX strain used here could not be propagated in CK cells, so a CD 50 dose of 10 2.73 was used. Mock-infected controls were inoculated via the same route with 0.1 ml of PBS, and mock/ challenge control groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml PBS and challenged with the same dose of wild-type virus. Birds were euthanized by cervical dislocation at specific times postinfection, and a panel of tissues was sampled to allow for downstream analysis. Blood samples were collected and processed for the collection of serum. The clinical signs used to determine pathogenicity were snicking, rales, and ciliary activity of the trachea (a bird was considered protected if 50% or more ciliary activity was retained in 9 of 10 tracheal rings; this must be in 80% of the group) (28, 52) .

Isolation of tissues: virus isolation and ciliostasis assay. Tissues collected were divided into two parts; one part was stabilized in RNAlater (Ambion) for RNA extraction and the other in 20% sucrose-PBS (0.22-m-pore size filtered) at 4°C overnight before snap freezing in OCT (Thermo Scientific) for histology. Tissues collected included: Harderian gland, CALT, NALT, and trachea. Tissues were removed at 2 and 4 days postvaccination (dpv) and at 2, 4, and 14 days postchallenge (dpc). Tracheas were removed from five randomly selected chickens from each group at 4 dpv and 4 dpc for assessment of ciliary activity as described previously (26) . Part of the trachea and CALT tissues were stored in PBS for virus isolation.

Detection of viral RNA. For virus isolation and RNA extraction, tissues stored in PBS and RNAlater, respectively, were freeze-thawed and homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen), as described previously (23) . Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini-Kit and DNase treated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of tRNA using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with a random oligonucleotide primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. To quantify infectious viral load in trachea, tissue-derived supernatant was titrated in TOCs. To determine whether infectious virus was present, 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs were inoculated with 100 l of allantoic fluid; then, at 24 to 48 hpi they were assessed for viral presence by RT-PCR using primers specific for the 3= UTR, as described previously (53) . For quantification of viral load, qPCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with primers and probes specific to the 5=-UTR region, as described previously (29) . Serial dilutions of M41 cDNA (generated from 1 g of tRNA) were included to generate a standard curve, and the data, expressed in terms of the cycle threshold (C T ) value, were normalized using the C T value of the 28S cDNA product for the same sample (54) .

Infectious bronchitis virus ELISA. Serum samples collected at 21 dpv (prechallenge) and at 2, 4, and 14 dpc were assayed with a commercial IDEXX IBV antibody test kit (IDEXX Laboratories). To determine the endpoint titer, the serum samples were twofold serially diluted in the range 1:20 to 1:2,560 prior to rIBV Partially Protects against IBV Journal of Virology incubation. After sample incubation, the remaining steps were followed directly according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample/positive (S/P) ratio was calculated using by the following equation: [(mean sample -mean kit negative)/(mean kit positive -mean kit negative)]. S/P ratios greater than 0.2 were considered positive for IBV antibodies. Polyclonal chicken serum raised against M41 and QX serum were included on each independent test plate (GD Animal Health). Immunocytochemistry. For fluorescent microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone, washed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer). Slides were washed and incubated for 1 h with optimally diluted primary antibodies (anti-Bu-1 [clone AV-20; AbD Serotec], anti-CD8␣ [clone 3-298, AbD Serotec], and anti-CD8␤ [clone EP42, AbD Serotec]) and anti-CSF1R (55) or isotype controls, all diluted in blocking buffer. Sections were washed, incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/ IgG2a or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1/IgG2b according to the appropriate isotype, and diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were captured with a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope with a coupled device digital camera and analyzed using ImageJ analysis software. For light microscopy, cryostat sections (5 m) were fixed in acetone and stained with Harris' hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% eosin (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were dehydrated through graded ethanols and xylene and mounted in a xylene-based medium (DePex; Gurr-BDH Chemicals). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Nano-zoomer-XR digital slide scanner.

Analysis of neutralizing antibody. Virus neutralization tests were performed by GD Animal Health (56) . Briefly, twofold serial dilutions of serum were made in a 1:1 mixture of Medium-199 and Ham F10 in 96-well plates. To each well, an equal volume of CEK cells (in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) was added. After culture with M41 for 3 to 4 days at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , cell monolayers were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE). All individual titers were expressed as the log 2 value of the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that showed complete inhibition of CPE.

Statistical analyses. Viral load qPCR data were tested for normality through residual plots, and the differences between the mean corrected 40-C T values were statistically evaluated by a parametric one-way analysis of variance test adjusted for post hoc analysis using Tukey's pairwise comparison. Serum antibody levels, viral isolation titers, ciliary activity, and virus neutralization titers were tested for normality, and nonparametric analyses were performed. Differences between the groups were statistically evaluated by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis and Mann-Whitney U pairwise comparison. The relationship between anti-IBV serum and virus neutralization titers were compared by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Analysis of the viral growth curves was conducted by fitting a polynomial curve to the exponential phase of viral growth (57); growth rates were then compared between groups by using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for post hoc analysis. For all statistical analyses, P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using MiniTab v17 or GraphPad Prism 7.

Assay development and high throughput antiviral drug screening against Bluetongue virus,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock. There are no antivirals available against BTV disease. In this paper, we present the development, optimization and validation of an in vitro cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using the luminescent-based CellTiter-Glo reagent to identify novel antivirals against BTV. Conditions of the cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay were optimized at cell density of 5 000 cells/well in medium containing 1% FBS and a multiplicity of infection at 0.01 in 384-well plate, with Z'-values ≥ 0.70, Coefficient of Variations ≥ 5.68 and signal-to-background ratio ≥ 7.10. This assay was further validated using a 9 532 compound library. The fully validated assay was then used to screen the 194 950 compound collection, which identified 693 compounds with > 30% CPE inhibition. The tenconcentration dose response assay identified 185 structures with IC 50 ≤ 100 μM, out of which 42 compounds were grouped into six analog series corresponding to six scaffolds enriched within the active set compared to their distribution in the library. The CPE-based assay development demonstrated its robustness and reliability, and its application in the HTS campaign will make significant contribution to the antiviral drug discovery against BTV disease.","Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a non-enveloped, multi-layered, double-stranded RNA virus in the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae, one of the largest families of viruses including major human pathogens (e.g., rotavirus) and other vertebrate, plant and insect pathogens. BTV is transmitted by biting midges of Culicoides, including C. variipennis and C. imocola (Mellor, 2000) . BTV replicates in both vertebrate and insect hosts, causing diseases in wild ruminants and economic important animals including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals around the world (Mellor, 2000; Mellor & Wittmann, 2002) , with $3 billion/year loss worldwide (MacLachlan & Osburn, 2006; Mellor et al., 2008) . Due to its economic significance, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies and now represents one of the well characterized viruses.

There are no antiviral drugs and no effective control measures developed against BTV. Currently, vector control and vaccination using BTV virus-like particles are two main prevention strategies being implemented to prevent the possible BTV epidemics (Blair et al., 2000; Travanty et al., 2004) . However, such strategies have been demonstrated to be insufficient due to the changes of vector habitats and new virus strains. The 1998-2001 outbreak of BTV in the Mediterranean Basin was the greatest epizootic of the disease on record, showing that BTV had extended its range northwards into areas of Europe that were never affected before and has persisted in many of these locations (Meiswinkel et al., 2008) . This epidemic has been linked to the recent distribution extensions of its major vector, C. imicola, the involvement of novel Culicoides vector(s), and an apparent ability of the virus to overwinter in the absence of adult vectors Mellor & Wittmann, 2002) . Thus, it is urgent to develop effective antiviral drugs against BTV infection to avoid possible epidemics.

Developing robust and reliable biological assay(s) is critical for antiviral drug discovery. Traditional antiviral drug discovery assays include cytopathic effects (CPE)-based assay, genomic and/or subgenomic replicon-based assay, and plaque forming assay (Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2005; Severson et al., 2008; Severson et al., 2007) . CPE is evident in BTV infected vertebrate cells, such as HeLa, BSR, and HEK 293T, including both the biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cellular shrinkage) (Li et al., 2007) . BTV-induced CPE and/or apoptosis could be monitored using different CPE and apoptosis detection methods, which make the development of a robust and reliable assay possible. Here, we present the development of a robust and reliable CPE-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay for antiviral drug discovery against BTV infection, and the identification of novel antiviral compounds that protect host cells from BTV infection.

BSR cell line, a derivative cell line from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). Unless otherwise noted, cells were harvested and re-suspended in assay medium, DMEM with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L and 1% FBS. After plating and/or compound treatment, cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity for the time period as noted.

The BTV-10 stocks were propagated in BSR cells as previously described (Li et al., 2007) . Briefly, BSR cells were grown in T75 flasks to 90% confluent, and then infected with BTV-10 virus at multiple of infection (MOI) of 0.01. After 72 h incubation, cells were harvested and centrifuged. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris were then centrifuged at 3 000 × rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatants were aliquoted (1ml each tube) and saved at -80 °C. The BTV stocks from the cells were titrated in BSR cells using the TCID 50 assay. The final titer was at 1 × 10 8 TCID 50 /ml.

Virus titers were determined in BSR cell monolayers grown in 96-well plates. BSR cells were seeded at 15 000/well in a 96-well plate, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity. A volume of 100 μl of 10-fold serially diluted virus was inoculated into each well in quadruplicate format. Plates were further incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity for 72 h, after which, CPE was observed microscopically at 40 × magnification. Virus titers were expressed as TCID 50 unit per ml of solution.

Carrier control consisted of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) diluted in complete assay media to 0.6% and 5 μl of which was dispensed to both cells and virus control wells of 384-well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates (Corning). Test compounds were diluted in media to 60 μM with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%. A total volume of 5 μl was dispensed to each well in the assay plate with a final assay volume of 30 μL resulting in final concentrations of 0.1% DMSO and 10 μM test compounds. Compound dilution and addition were performed with a Beckman Coulter FX liquid handler. After brief centrifugation, assay plates were transferred to the cell plating facility. For ten-concentration dose response assay, the compounds were added to assay media by a two-fold serial dilution, ranging from 20 μM to 0.04 μM.

For the validation assay and large scale HTS assay, cells were plated in 384-well plates at a cell density of 5 000 cells/well (or otherwise noted) in 15 μL assay media using a WellMate bulk dispenser (Matrix, Inc.). Plates were then incubated for 2-4 hrs at 37 °C, 5.0% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity incubators (Thermo-Scientific).

Cells were infected with BTV at MOI of 0.01, or otherwise noted in the text. The BTV stock (1 × 10 8 TCID 50 /ml) was first diluted in assay media containing 5 000 TCID 50 /ml of the virus. The diluted virus (10 μl) was added to the compound wells and the virus only control wells. Media only (mock infection) was added to the cell control wells. All additions were carried out using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the Bio-Safety Level 2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for another 72 h, at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and 80-95% humidity.

The CellTiter-Glo buffer and the lyophilized CellTiter-Glo substrate (Promega Inc., Madison, USA) were thawed and equilibrated to room temperature prior to use. The homogeneous CellTiter-Glo reagent solution was reconstituted after mixing the lyophilized enzyme/substrate and the buffer reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Meanwhile, the assay plates were also equilibrated to room temperature for 15 minutes. An equal volume (30 μl) of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to each well. Plates were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature to stabilize luminescent signals. Luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s.

In order to identify common structural elements within the identified actives hits, the compound sets were clustered using cheminformatics tools available in LeadScope (LeadScope, Inc., Columbus, Ohio). A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using a Tanimoto index threshold of 0.7, applying the complete linkage method. For each cluster, a representative substructure was identified as a common motif shared by all members of a cluster. Enrichment ratios were computed for the cluster substructures in order to predict whether the substructure may be considered privileged or not.

During the HTS campaign, thirty two control wells containing cells only and 32 wells containing cells and virus were included on each assay plate. These controls were used to calculate Z'-value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. All raw data were imported to Activity Base Data Management software (IDBS, Alameda, CA) for the determination of Z'-value, signal-to-background (S/B, fold decrease) ratio and percent inhibition for assayed compounds. Results were expressed as percent inhibition of CPE where 100% inhibition of CPE was equal to the mean of the cell only control. Compounds showing greater than average CPE inhibition plus three times standard deviation of % inhibition of viralinduced CPE of all compounds were considered ""hits"" and tested in ten-concentration dose response assay. Statistical calculations of Z'-values were made as follows:

Here Mean S is the mean luminescent signals from cell control, StdDev S is the standard deviation of the luminescent signals from cell control, Mean B is the mean luminescent signals from BTV infection control, and StdDev B is the standard deviation of the luminescent signals from virus infection control. S/B = Mean S /Mean B (Ghosh et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 1999) . Each assay validation step was performed in triplicate with the exception of the validation screening of 9 532 compounds which was performed in duplicate. The screening of NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) with 194 950 compounds and dose response assay were carried out once.

BTV infection induces apoptosis and/or CPE in a number of mammalian cells, including Vero, HeLa, BHK/BSR (Li et al., 2007; Mortola et al., 2004; Nagaleekar et al., 2007; Schwartz-Cornil et al., 2008) . Characteristics of apoptosis and CPE, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation, have been shown and the apoptotic pathway has been elucidated (Li et al., 2007; Mortola et al., 2004; Nagaleekar et al., 2007) . The quantitative analysis of the CPE induced by BTV infection was shown here using 96-well plate. BSR cells were seeded with a density of 15 000 cells/well, and infected with BTV at different MOIs, 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively. At different hours post infection (h.p.i.), BTV-induced CPE was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability kit, a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The single step ""add-mix-measure"" format resulting in cell lysis and the generation of luminescent signals is also ideal for future large scale HTS of various compound libraries. While there was no significant decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cell at 24 h.p.i., a two-fold decrease of cell viability in BTV infected cells was observed in all three MOIs at 48 h.p.i.. The decrease of cell viability was much more apparent at 72 h.p.i., with 9.7, 12.0 and 11.7 fold decreases, i.e. S/B ratio, for MOI of 0.5, 1.0 and 10, respectively ( Figure 1 ). This result showed that BTV infection induced CPE can be quantitated, especially at 72 h.p.i. with remarkable high S/B ratios. Meanwhile, this single step CPE-based assay will be suitable for future HTS assays, although further optimizations were necessary to improve this CPE-based assay into a primary HTS assay.

For large scale HTS, all compounds to be tested will be dissolved in DMSO solution. It has been shown that high DMSO concentrations (>1%) have dramatics effect on membrane permeability, cell viability and virus infection in MDCK cells (Irvine et al., 1999; Noah et al., 2007) . Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of DMSO on cell growth and cell viability of BSR cells. After being seeded in 96-well plates at 15 000 cells/well, BSR cells were treated with DMSO at different concentrations, ranging from 0.02% up to 2% (Figure 2 ). After 72 h incubation, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. The effect of DMSO on cell viability was compared between the cell viability in DMSO treated cells relative to cell viability in cells that were not treated with DMSO. When BSR cells were treated with DMSO at 1% or lower concentration, there were no decreases on the cell viability. In contrast, there was a slight increase of cell viability, ranging from 5% to 12%, when cells were treated with DMSO concentration below 1%. However, when cells were treated with 2% DMSO, there was 28.9% decrease of cell viability, a considerable decrease comparing with cells without DMSO treatment ( Figure 2 ). This result supported that the designated 0.6% DMSO concentration for our HTS campaign will be suitable for the screening. Meanwhile, there should be no more than 1% DMSO added to the cell culture for the entire screening when using this assay.

3.3.1 Optimization of cell density-The seeding cell density is important to avoid possible cell overgrowth, to obtain a maximum and consistent luminescent signal strength and good S/ B ratio (minimum > 5) in each well. To optimize the seeding cell density, BSR cells were seeded in 384-well plates at different density-2 500, 5 000, 7 500 and 10 000 cells/well, respectively. Cell viability were evaluated and analyzed at different time post seeding using CellTiter-Glo reagent (Fig. 3a) . At cell density of 7 500 and 10 000 cell/wells, cell growth reached a plateau at 48 h post seeding and luminescent signals decreased at 72 h post seeding. At cell density of 2 500 and 5 000 cells/well, cell growth did not reach a plateau at 72 h post seeding and luminescent signals were increased from 48 h to 72 h, and the 5 000 cells/well density showed the maximal luminescent signals, i.e. cell viability, and was chosen as the optimal cell density for all subsequent experiments.

growth and/or viability are also affected by the FBS concentration in the cell culture media. Traditional cell culture medium contains 5% or higher FBS which keeps the cells grow rapidly, however, the risk of overgrowth, which may lead to the decrease of cell viability, is high. Also, some compounds and viruses are known to bind to FBS and therefore would show up as false negatives in a screen. Two different FBS concentrations, 5% and 1% in DMEM media, were evaluated at different seeding cell densities. At both concentrations, seeding density at 7 500 and 10 000 cells/well showed similar pattern and the decreases of cell viability were observed at 72 h post seeding. At 5 000 cells/well seeding density, although cells were still multiplying at 72 h for both 1% and 5% FBS, the cell growth at 1% FBS concentration was more active when compared with cell growth at 5% FBS. Thus, we chose 1% FBS concentration and 5 000 cells/well cell density as the optimal cell culture conditions for all subsequent experiments.

The optimization of BTV infection was carried out to achieve the relative highest luminescent signals at the lowest MOI. In the previous experiment, at MOI of 0.5, the luminescent signals were decreased to a level similar to that obtained with an MOI of 1.0 and 10. Further observation showed that at even lower MOIs, CPE was also obvious (Results not shown). Thus, we chose five low MOIs, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 to infect BSR cells seeded at optimized cell density (5 000 cells/well). After cells were incubated for 48 and 72 h, cell viabilities were evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo reagent. At 48 h.p.i, cell viability was 1.7, 2.1, 2.4, 3.0 and 3.4 folders lower for MOIs of 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively, when compared with that of the mock infected cells. At 72 h.p.i., the fold decreases (S/B ratios) were 6. 3, 8.5, 11.4, 14.4 and 20.9 for MOIs of 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 respectively (Fig. 4) . The luminescent signals at MOI of 0.01 was comparable to that at MOI of 0.02 and 0.04 with good S/B ratio (11.4), which fit our standard to achieve relative high signal difference with lowest MOI. Thus, MOI of 0.01 was selected for all subsequent experiments including the primary HTS assay.

The Z'-value analysis is designed to evaluate if an assay is robust enough for screening on an HTS platform. The Z'-value evaluates the assay's signal dynamic range, the data variation associated with the sample measurement, and the data variation associated with the reference control measurement. To determine the Z'-value, the CPE-based assay in 384-well plates was run at three different days and three different assays, at the optimized conditions including cell density at 5 000 cells/well, 1% FBS media, BTV infection at MOI of 0.01 and final luminescent signals read at 72 h.p.i. The 384-well plate was divided into four quadrants, with the BTV infected cells as positive controls (S) in Quadrant I and IV, and the mock infected cells as negative controls (B) in Quadrant II and III on the plate. The Z'-value analysis was performed repeatedly to demonstrate reproducibility. We obtained an average Z'-value of 0.70 ± 0.01 under the optimized assay condition using the formula in section 2.9 (Zhang et al., 1999) . This demonstrated that the assay was robust and suitable as a primary HTS assay. Furthermore, according to our experience in HTS setting, the Z'-value would be higher once this assay was fully automated.

After the CPE-based assay was optimized and Z'-value determined in the laboratory, the assay was transferred to and adapted by the HTS Center at Southern Research Institute. The assay was first repeated in 384-well plates using automated liquid handling equipment which was also used for the screening of large scale compound library in section 3.5. Integration of the assay onto a HTS platform was evaluated at each individual step of the procedure, from loading the plates with cells to the final data analysis. The examination of intra-and inter-run variations, including well to well, plate to plate, and day to day variability, were carefully evaluated by running three Z' plates on three separate days for a total of nine plates, determined that the assay was sufficiently robust to screen a large compound library. Our results showed that the average Z'-value from these repeats were 0.75 ± 0.05, average Coefficient of Variations (CV) were 5.68 ± 0.62% for the cell control and S/B ratio of 7.10 ± 1.72. This results demonstrated that the quality control parameters for the assay met the requirements, including CV < 10%, Z'-values > 0.5, S/B > 5, and inter-run reproducibility.

The final validation step was the screening of a small compound set of 9 532 compounds on two different time and statistically comparing the results for reproducibility. The 9 532 compounds were screened at 10 μM concentration in two duplicate screens at different time. Quality control was assessed at several different points within the assay process. The values for the cell control and the BTV infection control wells were reviewed to determine the viability of each plate of compound data. Values from the duplicate screening were also compared to determine consistency. The average Z'-value from each plate, CV, S/B, and hit rates for compounds that inhibited CPE above 21.7% and 50%, were showed in Table 1 . The 21.7% inhibition of CPE equaled to average CPE inhibition plus three times standard deviation of % inhibition of all compounds from the duplicated screenings. The reproducibility and signal window robustness of the duplicate screenings were demonstrated with similar Z' values (0.70 vs 0.71), CVs from both cell controls (5.94 vs 4.52) and virus controls (19.87 vs 13.70), and S/B ratios that averaged from each plate (7.56 vs 4.49) (Table 1) . Overall, we observed an average hit rate of 0.2 -1.4% and 0.05% -0.1% for compounds that inhibited 21.7% and 50% of BTV-induced CPE, respectively. The Pearson's product moment correlations were high when comparing the duplicate screens, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80 with a P value of 0.23 indicating that there was no difference between the duplicate screenings.

After the reproducibility and robustness of the CPE-based assay were demonstrated and validated, 194 950 compounds from MLSMR were screened. Compounds from the MLSMR collection are generically grouped into the following four categories (a) specialty sets (SS), such as known drugs and toxins, (b) targeted libraries (TL) such as kinase or GPCR inhibitors, (c) natural products (NP), and (d) diversity compounds (DC), which represents general chemical diversity. These compounds were selected based on their physico-chemical properties with cutoffs applied, including MW <1 000, cLogP < 5, HBA < 20 and HBD < 10. All compounds were screened once at 10 μM using the validated CPE-based assay in six separate runs under the exact optimized experimental conditions. The hits identified were based on a 30.04% inhibition of virus induced CPE which equaled to average inhibition plus three times standard deviation of % inhibition of all compounds from the entire MLSMR screen. The assay robustness, including the average Z'-value and S/B ratio were graphically illustrated in Figure  5 . The average Z'-value for the entire screening was 0.70 ± 0.06 (Figure 5a) , which matched to the Z'-values obtained from the duplicated validation screenings. The average CVs were 4.63 ± 1.31 for cells only and 10.50 ± 3.54 for virus infection only (results not shown). The S/ B ratio was 3.88 ± 0.56 (Figure 5b ) for the entire screening including the cell control, virus infection control and the virus infection plus drug treatments. The percentage of inhibition of virus induced CPE from each compound in the screening was plotted in Figure 6 . Out of the 194 950 compounds screened, we identified 693 hits with over 30% CPE inhibition, with a hit rate of 0.03%. There were 147 compounds identified with over 50% inhibition of virus induced CPE (Table 1 & Figure 6 ).

Six hundred and fifty-eight of these compounds were available for further testing using a tenconcentration dose response assay. Out of the 658 dose response tested hits, an 'active set' of 185 compounds possessing IC 50 values less than 100 μM was selected for the purpose of structural analysis. In order to identify common structural elements within the 185 actives, this set was clustered. For each cluster, a representative substructure was identified as a common motif shared by all members of the cluster. The enrichment ratio characterizing a particular substructure was defined here as the ratio between the percentage of compounds that contain this substructure within the active set (185 compounds) and the same percentage within the entire library screened (194 942 compounds). Privileged scaffolds contributing to the activity of hits were typically present in higher percentages among active compounds compared to their distribution within the entire screened library. We selected scaffolds representative of hit clusters that showed enrichment ratios greater than 10 and these were listed in decreasing order of cluster sizes on Scheme I. Privileged scaffolds were likely to be present among non-clustered actives or in small clusters (with members less than 3) as well. Therefore selection of scaffolds further pursued will include clustered hits as well as non-clustered, singleton active structures.

CPE is a general term used to describe the adverse effect on the cells post viral infection. CPE involves at least two distinct processes: necrosis and apoptosis. Various assays are available to distinguish these two mechanisms through measuring a variety of different markers that indicate the number of dead cells (cytotoxicity), the number of live cells (viability), and the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis). Most conventional cell-based antiviral drug screening assays were developed based on the cell viability assay (ATPase, kinase and cytotoxicity). The introduction of CPE-based assay using ATP/luminescence readout, such as CellTiter-Glo reagent, has been recently reported, which made the HTS against large compound library possible in several different antiviral assays, including the antiviral HTS assays against influenza virus (Noah et al., 2007; Severson et al., 2008) , SARS-CoV , Yellow fever virus (Gong et al., 2008) , Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Paragas et al., 2004) . Our CPE-based antiviral assay against BTV also showed its feasibility with the ""mix and measure"" one step protocol, and flexibility with stable luminescent signals. Meanwhile, toxic compounds that reduced the cell viability were also excluded in this CPE-based assay. This CPE-based assay was also easy to be adapted and validated in HTS Center, making it possible to screen large compound libraries, such as MLSMR collection. This assay may also be used for assays based on CPE induced by other reoviruses and arboviruses.

Our assay also demonstrated its robustness with a high degree of reproducibility and low deviation including a reproducible Z'-value over 0.7, high sensitivity and low background with S/B ratios ranging from 3.88 to 7.56. Typically, a S/B ratio greater than 5 is an adequate detection window, and the Z'-value > 0.5 are considered robust enough for a HTS assay (Zhang et al., 1999) . The duplicated validation screening of the CPE-based assay using the 9 532 testing compound library, and the primary HTS assay against MLSMR further demonstrated the assay was sufficiently robust and reproducible for a HTS platform with very similar statistical assay performance values, including Z'-value between 0.70 and 0.71, CV for the cell control between 4.52% and 5.94%, and S/B between 4.49 and 7.56 (Table 1) . CV from the virus infected control was higher than 10%, which is natural for the virus infected cells due to the complexity nature if virus infection process. The S/B ratio form one of the validation screenings was 4.49, lower than 5.0 as requirement, however, the consistent Z'-value from the validation screenings indicated that this assay was robust for using in HTS. Indeed, similar Z'-values, CV and S/B ratio were also obtained for these assay parameters in our primary HTS, which further demonstrated that the assay is reproducible and reliable.

All three screenings showed similar hit rates, between 0.05% and 0.10% for the hits that inhibited CPE by >50% (Table 1 ). Similar hit rates were observed in a number of HTS assays against various viruses, including 0.08% and 0.022% hit rates in two assays for identification of influenza inhibitors, respectively (Noah et al., 2007; Severson et al., 2008) , and 0.01% for SARS-CoV HTS . Although it is possible to increase the hit rate by manipulating the assay conditions, including dosing at a higher compound concentration (i.e. >10 μM) and/or reducing the assay length from 72 to 48 h, we were very confident that these hits identified through the primary HTS were accurate, evidenced by the corresponding hit correlation in the duplicated 10 K screening and confirmed by the dose response assay.

Hit compounds with IC 50 less than 100 μM were clustered to identify common substructures. Among these, Scheme I lists substructures with highest enrichment among active hits comparing to their distribution in the entire library screened. The clusters identified include mononuclear heterocylic compounds such as the thiophene and thiazole derivatives 1 and 3, bicyclic compounds such as the pyrimidines 2, 4 and 5 fused to a 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1,2-4thiadiazole and pyrazole ring systems. Scaffolds 2 and 4 have very similar core scaffolds. The thienooxazinones 6 can be considered as cyclic derivatives of the ortho sustituted thiophene derivatives represented by 1. Note, scaffold 3 may be considered a small group of closely related analog series where nearly all members in the series were active.

The development of a CPE-based assay against BTV infection and the HTS of the MLSMR library provided a unique model system and identified a number of novel antiviral compounds that protect host cells from BTV infection. BTV is the prototype virus in the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. BTV is considered to be one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, and has been a subject of intense molecular study for the last three decades and is now one of the best understood viruses at the molecular and structural levels Roy, 2008) . As a member of reoviruses and arboviruses, BTV must be capable and should be sufficiently flexible to allow its replication in evolutionarily distant hosts, which also applied to other reoviruses and arboviruses including members in the families of Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Reoviridae. Since antiviral compounds identified here could protect host cells from BTV-induced CPE responses, these compounds might also protect host cells from other reoviruses and arboviruses infections. Meanwhile, any compound identified using this assay could be used as a chemical probe to further study the virus-host interactions. Thus, our developed HTS assay will be of direct benefit to the drug development and drug design to counter reoviruses and arboviruses diseases, thereby have a positive impact on the widespread burden of these diseases. The effect of DMSO on the cell viability at 72 h post seeding. Cells were seeded and treated with different concentrations of DMSO (percentage). Cell viability was expressed by luminescent signals (units per well). Line indicated the level of luminescent signals from the cells with no DMSO treatment. The experiment was repeated for three times and each data point represents the average value of 16 replicates. The effect of seeding cell density and FBS concentrations in DMEM media on the BSR cells. Cell viability was expressed by luminescent signals (units per well). Cells were seeded in 384well plates at different cell densities with different FBS concentration in DMEM media, 5% FBS concentration in Figure 3a and 1% FBS concentration in Figure 3b . Cell viabilities were measured at different time post seeding and were expressed as luminescent signals per well using CellTiter-Glo reagent. At 24 h post seeding, data for cell density at 2,500 and 5,000 cells/ well were not shown in both Figure 3a and 3b. The experiment was repeated for three times and each data point represents the average value of 16 replicates.

In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs for many important human viral pathogens, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre-and/or post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such hmAbs may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process, the mechanisms of virus neutralization and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines and research tools. The majority of the more recently developed antiviral hmAbs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies using both naïve and immune libraries. Many of these agents are also enveloped viruses possessing important neutralizing determinants within their membrane-anchored envelope glycoproteins and the use of recombinant, soluble versions of these viral glycoproteins is often critical in the isolation and development of antiviral hmAbs. This chapter will detail several methods that have been successfully employed to produce, purify and characterize soluble and secreted versions of several viral envelope glycoproteins which have been successfully used as antigens to capture and isolate human phage-displayed monoclonal antibodies.","For the vast majority of viral pathogens there is a paucity of drug-based therapies. Rather, it has been the development of vaccines that has been the mainstay of prevention and intervention strategies for combating human and animal viral diseases. There are presently 15 viral vaccines approved for human use, excluding various subtypes, and the majority of these are live-attenuated formulations (reviewed in (1)). In general terms, these liveattenuated viral vaccines are highly effective because they elicit a balanced immune response in the recipient host; stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, for many viruses especially those that have associated highly pathogenic characteristics as with Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) restricted agents or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the use of live attenuated vaccines are not feasible.

A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of neutralizing antibodies in the protection or recovery from viral infections (2, 3) . Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies have a long history of being effective against some viruses and more recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is currently the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals and is more cost-effective and efficacious than the original polyclonal product (4) . Most recently, the anti-RSV palivizumab has been improved, and motavizumab has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in a cotton rat model (5) . Virus-neutralizing antibodies can also be administered passively to acutely infected individuals and be highly efficacious. The mechanism of passively administered antibody therapy can be viewed as that of an antiviral drug; suppressing infection and permitting the host to mount an effective immune response (6) . Today, passively administered antibody is routinely used as an effective antiviral therapy or prophylactic for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, rabies virus, measles virus, and others (reviewed in (2)). In most cases their use is a first-line therapy as a post-exposure measure or in circumstances where vaccination is not possible. However, serum polyclonal antibody preparations have associated problems related to toxicity and potential allergic reactions, as well as lot to lot variation and uncertain dosing regimes (7) .

The major advances in furthering the development of specific mAbs, has been through the use of bacterial phage display platforms with combinatorial antibody libraries (8, 9) . Further, these phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as Fabs which contain the light chain and the first two domains of the heavy chain or single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) containing the variable domains of the light and heavy chains, and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to improve antibody binding (reviewed in (10) ). These techniques in human phage-display antibody platforms have facilitated the rapid identification and isolation of specific human mAbs, eliminating the immunization, hybridoma development, and humanization processes. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre-and post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such antibodies may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process and its underlying mechanisms, the viral neutralization mechanisms and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines and research tools. There have been many recent examples of the development and isolation of hmAbs using phage-display methodologies reactive against important human viral pathogens including HIV-1 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , the paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) (17) , and the human SARS coronavirus (18) .

Many of these viral pathogens are also enveloped viruses, and it is almost without exception that all neutralizing antibodies to enveloped viruses are directed against the virus' envelope glycoproteins and traditionally the antibody response has been the immunologic measure of vaccine efficacy (19) . All known viral envelope glycoproteins are homo-or heterooligomers in their mature and functional forms (20) and multimeric proteins, like these, generally interact over large areas which often translate into important structural differences between monomeric subunits and the mature oligomer. This feature can also impart significant differences in antigenic structure which has been shown for a number of proteins such as the trimeric influenza HA glycoprotein (21) and HIV-1 gp120/gp41 (22) . In addition, some viruses pose significant additional challenges such as antigenic variation of their structural proteins that are important neutralization determinants. Perhaps the best characterized example of this particular problem is with primary HIV-1 isolates that exist across the many varied HIV-1 subtypes (23) . In efforts to circumvent this issue, further improvements and enhancements in the techniques of phage-displayed antibody library panning have been developed in order to better select for broadly reactive mAbs or for mAbs reactive to particular subunits of a multi-subunit viral glycoprotein such as sequential antigen panning (SAP) and competitive (CAP) antigen panning methodologies (14, 15) .

It is often critical that the antigens used for the panning and isolation of hmAbs from phage libraries be produced and/or purified using methods whereby they retain a near native structure and conformation, such as an oligomeric configuration. A useful approach to develop viral membrane glycoproteins suitable for panning phage libraries or as antigens for eliciting antibody responses that recognize their native form is to engineer soluble and secreted versions of the molecules. Often, this approach yields a quaternary structure similar to their native counterparts and for animal viruses, eukaryotic expression systems are typically employed such as recombinant bacculovirus or vaccinia virus, or transient or stable expression in cell culture (22, (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) . This chapter will detail several methods that have been successfully employed to produce, purify and characterize soluble and secreted versions of several viral envelope glycoproteins which have been successfully used as antigens to capture and isolate human phage-displayed monoclonal antibodies.

The methods described below outline the steps for recombinant viral glycoprotein production using vaccinia virus for HIV-1 gp140 and HeV and NiV soluble G glycoprotein (sG) and affinity purification of the glycoproteins. In addition, recombinant viral glycoprotein production and affinity purification from stable HeV and NiV soluble F glycoprotein (sF) secreting 293T cell lines will be detailed. Additional purification methods are also detailed, including size exclusion gel filtration and analysis and separation of oligomeric species of the purified viral glycoproteins; sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis; and Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis.

The design and construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding HIV-1 gp140 and HeV and NiV sG as well as the characterization of the recombinant, soluble and secreted viral glycoproteins have been detailed elsewhere (24, 40) . In this section for the purposes of additional illustration there will be an emphasis on the production and purification of soluble and secreted forms of the HeV and NiV F glycoprotein, including the analysis of oligomeric characteristics as well as the generation of stable cell lines secreting recombinant soluble F (sF). 

Transfer the cells to a large 250 mL conical bottom tube and centrifuge the cells at 500g for 10 minutes to pellet the cells.

Resuspend the cell pellet in EMEM-10 to a volume of 5 times the number of T-150 flasks that were harvested (e.g. cells from 2 T-150 flasks should be resuspended in 10 mL of EMEM-10) (see Note 4).

Add 200 mL of EMEM-10 and add 5 mL of the cell/media suspension to each roller bottle.

Flow 10% CO 2 , 90% air into each roller bottle with for 30 sec at approximately 150 kPa and tighten the caps of the roller bottles (see Note 5).

Incubate the roller bottles in 37°C at 0.5 rpm for 5 days or until the cells are completely confluent to form a compact monolayer.

a. Thaw and vortex the purified recombinant vaccinia virus to be used for protein expression.

b. The virus inoculum is prepared in 5 mL of OptiMEM for each roller bottle to be infected at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell. A confluent roller bottle is estimated to have approximately 150 × 10 6 BSC-1 cells or 100 × 10 6 HeLa-USU cells (7.5 × 10 8 pfu for BSC-1 cells or 5 × 10 8 pfu for HeLa-USU cells per roller bottle).

Aspirate EMEM-10 and wash each roller bottle with 30 mL of pre-warmed sterile PBS three times. Avoid keeping the cells in PBS and without media for extended time.

3. Add 5 mL of virus inoculum (MOI=5) to each bottle and gently roll to spread the inoculum over the cell monolayer.

Immediately add an additional 15 mL of OptiMEM to each roller bottle and gently roll to spread the inoculum over the cell monolayer.

Return the roller bottles to the 37°C incubator and allow the infection to proceed for 3 hours at 0.5 rpm.

Following the 3 hour incubation, add an additional 120 mL of OptiMEM and flow each roller bottle with CO 2 as described in 3.1.1.1, step 7.

Incubate the cells in 37°C incubator at 0.5 rpm for 40 to 50 hours before harvesting the supernatant.

1. Empty the media from each roller bottle into 250 mL conical bottom centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 2000g for 20 min.

Collect the supernatant and add protease inhibitor according to manufacturer's recommendation and Triton® X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%

Filter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm PES (low protein-binding) filter unit (see Note 6).

The supernatant can be stored at 4°C and ready for affinity purification. We recommend to process the supernatant soonest possible.

is the first step of purification. Depending on the protein's nature or the tag engineered to the protein, different approaches can be carried out for affinity purification. Here, we describe the use of (1) Lentil lectin purification of the highly glycosylated HIV-1 gp140 and (2) S-protein agarose purification for the N-terminally S-peptide tagged HeV/ NiV sG. 6 Pre-wet the filter unit membrane with PBS, 0.1% Triton® X-100 or the appropriate washing buffer before filtering the supernatant. This can be done by filtering 50 to 100 mL of wash buffer prior to sample filtering. We find that this procedure will decrease protein lost during filtration. This step is essential for purification of sF. 

Wash the column with 300 mL of wash buffer I follow by 100 mL of wash buffer II to remove triton.

To elute the protein, apply elution buffer to the column, stop the flow after the first 10 mL of flow through and incubate for 15 min. Collect 25 mL of the elution in a sterile 50 mL tube, stop the flow and incubate for 15 min. Repeat elution and incubation for 3-5 times to collect several 25 mL elutions.

Combine the eluate and concentrate it to less than 2 mL follow by buffer exchange into protein buffer (PBS) using Centriprep® molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.

Filter the purified protein through a 0.2 μm low protein binding syringe filter membrane and store at 4°C. Pre-wet the membrane with protein buffer before filtering.

To regenerate the column, apply 50 mL of high pH buffer follow by 50 mL of low pH buffer through the column. Repeat this step 2 times.

After the last low pH wash, apply 200 mL regeneration buffer through the column follow by 200 mL PBS.

Finally, apply 200 mL 20% EtOH through the column and store the beads in 20% EtOH at 4 °C. The beads can be reused for up to 5 times.

1. Load 15 mL bed volume of S-protein Agarose into a XK 26 column. Always maintain at least 2-3 cm of buffer above the surface of the agarose.

Allow the column inlet adaptor to be 3-5 cm above the buffer level allowing input buffer to enter the column drop wise. Use a peristaltic pump to apply buffer through the inlet tubing. Solution passing through the column outlet depends on gravity.

Wash the column with 6 x bed volumes of PBS follow by 6 x bed volumes of wash buffer II (refer to section 2.5.2 for buffers).

Apply the prepared supernatant from 3.1.1.3 to the column. Maintain a flow rate of 3 to 4 mL per minute by adjusting the peristaltic pump and a stopcock connected at the outlet tubing of the column.

Wash the column with 3X bed volumes of wash buffer I follow by 6x bed volumes of wash buffer II and subsequently 6x bed volumes of PBS.

To elute the bound protein, stop the pump and allow the PBS to drain until it reaches the surface of the beads. Add 15 mL of elution buffer. Incubate the elution buffer with the beads for 10 min after collecting the first 8 mL of flow through (this should still be the PBS).

Collect 15 mL of the elution into a 50 mL sterile conical centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of neutralization buffer. Check the pH with pH strips and add more neutralization buffer if needed to obtain neutral pH.

Repeat the elution and incubation for 2 to 3 times.

Wash the column with 6X bed volume of PBS follow by 6X bed volume of 20% ethanol. Store the beads in ethanol. The beads can be reused for up to 5 times.

Combine all neutralized elution with the first 8 mL flow through from step 5.

Concentrate the elution to less than 2 mL and buffer exchange the elution into protein buffer (PBS) using Centriprep® molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.

Filter the purified protein through a 0.2 μm low protein binding filter membrane and store at 4°C. Pre-wet the membrane with the same protein buffer before filtering.

while constructing the expression plasmid e.g. Kozak translation initiation sequence and an ATG start codon for proper initiation of translation, promoter/enhancer and termination sequences, the expression plasmid employed, the type of antibiotic selection, the cell line employed, codon optimization of the viral RNA sequence, mutation and modifications on the amino acid sequence to enhance expression and secretion, the tag required in facilitating protein purification, etc. The sF construct described here has been optimized based on all the above concerns. Figure 1 diagrams the construct of our sF GCN.

The vector employed was a promoter modified pcDNA 3.1 Hygro (+). The enhanced CMV promoter was imported from phCMV 1 vector that allows high expression level of the human and mouse codon optimized sF. The Hygromycin selection marker allows the selection of transfected 293T cell which is resistant to the commonly used Geneticin antibiotic. Replacing the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domain of F is the trimeric GCN4 motif (41, 42) that allows stabilization of the protein trimeric structure (26, 43) and hence enhances the expression and secretion of the protein. This is followed by the 15 amino acid S-peptide that facilitates purification and immuno-detection of the sF by S-protein agarose and anti S-peptide antibody. A factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) is also engineered upstream to the S-peptide tag allowing removal of the tag by enzymatic digestion. Standard cloning procedures were employed to construct the plasmid.

Before generating a stable cell line, several optimizations may be required to obtain the best expression level. This can be investigated in transient expression using various cell lines to obtain the best result. We describe here the transient transfection of the sF construct in 293T cells using lipid-based transfection procedure. The expression level can be analyzed using immuno or affinity precipitations from the cell lysate and supernatant follow by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to access the secretion level. Figure 2 shows a representative result of transient transfection of various sF construct to assess the secretion level by western blotting. The addition of GCN tail and codon optimization by Geneart, Inc. greatly enhanced expression and secretion of the sF.

A day prior to transfection, Seed 0.4 × 10 6 / well in 3 mL DMEM-10 of 293T cell onto a 6-well tissue culture plate pre-coated with 0.1% Gelatin (see Note 7) . Allow the cells to adhere and grow in 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 overnight.

Cells should be 70-90% confluent the next day. Prepare transfection mixture as follow: Add 6μl of Fugene transfection reagent to 0.5 mL of serum-free DMEM.

Gently mix the solution. Add 2 μg of plasmid DNA to the mixture and vortex briefly. Incubate the transfection mixture at room temperature for 30 min.

Transfect one well with the vector DNA without the gene of interest as negative control.

Aspirate the medium from the 6-well plate and replace with 0.5 mL of fresh DMEM-10/well. Add the transfection mixture to the cell at the side of the well without disturbing the monolayer. Gently rock the plate to mix.

Incubate the cells at 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 for overnight or at least 3 hours before adding an additional 0.5 mL of DMEM-10.

Continue to incubate the cells at 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 for 36 to 48 hrs to allow protein expression and secretion to take place.

for immuno or affinity precipitations to assess the secretion level.

1. Collect the supernatant from the 6-well plate into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 18,000g for 1 min to pellet cells.

Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and add 30 μL of 50% slurry S-agarose. Rotate at room temperature for 1 hr.

3. Add 1 tablet of complete mini protease inhibitor to 10 mL of lysis buffer. Add 0.7 mL of this lysis buffer / well to the cells remaining on the plate. Allow lysis on ice for 5-10 min.

Transfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and rotate at 4°C for 5-10 min to allow complete lysis.

Centrifuge the lysate at 18,000g for at least 5 min to pellet cell debris.

Transfer the cleared lysate to a fresh tube and add 30 μL of 50% slurry S-agarose beads. Rotate at room temperature for 1 hr.

After the affinity binding, centrifuge the samples at 3,000g for 1 min to pellet the agarose beads. Aspirate the unbound lysate or supernatant without disturbing the agarose beads.

Wash the agarose beads by adding 1 mL of lysis buffer and mix by inverting the tube several times.

Repeat steps 7 and 8 for at least twice.

After aspirating the lysis buffer at the last washing step, add 50 μL of 2x SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer with 50 μL of 2-Mercaptoethanol per 1 mL of sample buffer to the agarose.

Vortex and boil the samples for 5 min. Centrifuge the samples at 3,000g for 1 min. Use 25 μL for standard SDS-PAGE follow by Western blotting procedures.

For immuno-detection, use 1/20,000 dilution of HRP conjugated Rabbit anti-S-tag antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour. We use the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate as the HRP substrate. See Figure 2 for Western blot result.

with the best cell line, a stable cell line can be generated. In order to select a stable cell clone expressing the soluble glycoprotein, the minimum concentration of the appropriate selection antibiotic required to kill the non transfected host cell line needs to be determined. Because natural resistance varies among cell lines, we recommend testing a range of antibiotic concentrations on 25% confluent cells. Choose the concentration that prevents growth within 2-3 days and kills all cells within 5-7 days. The procedures described here have been optimized for 293T cells. 

To the cells remaining on the plate for cell line generation, add 2 mL of PBS to wash the cells without disturbing the monolayer.

Remove the PBS and add 0.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA, allow trypsinization for 3-5 sec before aspirating the trypsin.

Use 1 mL fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 25 cm 2 tissue culture flask.

6. Add 4 mL of DMEM-10 to the flask and allow cells to adhere at 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 for several hours or overnight.

Once cells have adhered, replace the medium with fresh DMEM-10 supplemented with 150 μg/mL Hygromycin B.

Prepare another flask with the same selection medium for non transfected cells to monitor the action of the antibiotic.

Change and replace the selection medium when necessary by observing the color change of the medium. Changing the medium will also remove dead cells.

Non expressing cells should die within several days and expressing colonies will start to form. For 293T cells, this may take 7 to 10 days depending on the transfection efficiency. When all dead cells have been removed and colonies are growing well, the cells should be transferred into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask to form monolayer.

Aspirate medium from the 25 cm 2 flask and add 2 mL of PBS. Gently rock the flask before aspirating the PBS.

Then, add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA and leave for 5 sec. Aspirate the trypsin and use 2 mL of fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask.

13. Add 18 mL of DMEM-10 supplemented with 150 μg/mL Hygromycin B to the flask. Allow the cells to grow and form monolayer in 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 .

14. Once cells have reached confluence, split them at 1 in 5 dilution in selection medium. Repeat this for another 2 passages. Keep 1 mL of supernatant for affinity precipitation to monitor the secretion level.

When cells reach confluence at the third passage, proceed to section 3.3.3.2.

1. Aspirate the medium from the 75 cm 2 flask and add 8 mL PBS. Gently rock the flask before aspirating the PBS.

Then, add 4 mL of trypsin-EDTA and leave for 5 sec. Aspirate the trypsin and use 10 mL of fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.

Pellet the cells at 800g for 10 min and resuspend the pellet in 20 mL DMEM-10.

Count the cells using trypan blue to exclude dead cells. Dilute 30 μL of the cell suspension to 8 cells/mL in 20 mL DMEM-10 medium. Freeze the remaining cells in liquid Nitrogen.

Prepare two 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. Fill 200 μL/ well of PBS to the outer 36 wells and 100 μL/ well of DMEM-10 supplemented with 300 μg/mL Hygromycin B to the inner 60 wells.

Add 100 μL / well of the diluted cells from step 4 to the 100 μL selection medium in the inner 60 wells of the prepared 96-well plates from step 5. Each well now should have less than one cell.

Allow colonies to form in 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 for 10 to 14 days. Observe each well under microscope to identify single colony wells after 10 days.

When the color of the medium starts to change, transfer all single colonies individually by pipetting up and down into 24-well plates with 1 mL selection medium added to the each well.

Allow monolayer to form in 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 for 4 to 6 days. When cells reach 70-90% confluence, take 0.9 mL of supernatant from each well for immunoprecipitation and western blotting (section 3.2.2.2) to assess for the strongest secreting clone. Replace the selection medium in the 24-well plate. Once the best clone has been determined, it can then be expanded into larger tissue culture flask.

Aspirate the medium from the well of the selected clone, add 1 mL PBS. Add 0.3 mL trypsin-EDTA after removing the PBS and allow trypsinization for 3 sec. Remove trypsin and resuspend cells in 1 mL DMEM-10.

Transfer the resuspended cells into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask added with 19 mL of selection medium. Allow the cells to grow to confluence in 37°C, 5-8% CO 2 this may take up to one week.

Repeat the cloning (steps 1 to 11) at least once to ensure stable expression and to obtain the best possible secreting clone.

Once a desirable clone has been obtained, expand the cell to larger flasks for freezing to keep as stock. Proceed to section 3.2.4 for protein expression.

Cell culture for expression-Once a stable cell line has been established, it can then be grown into roller bottles for larger scale protein production. The following protocol describes the large scale production of secreted sF from 293T cells in roller bottles. For protein expression, addition of selection antibiotic is not necessary. Because of the weak adherent nature of 293 derivative cells, gelatin treatment of the roller bottle surface is necessary to avoid the formation of cell clumps which will decrease the protein secretion level.

Add 50 mL of 0.1% sterile gelatin solution into each 1700 cm 2 roller bottle. Rotate at 1 rpm at 37°C for overnight or at least 1 hour.

Remove gelatin solution and wash once with 50 mL sterile PBS and once with DMEM medium.

Prepare 150 cm 2 flasks of sF 293T cell. One confluent flask of cells should be transferred into one 1700 cm 2 roller bottle.

Proceed to steps 2 to 8 in section 3.1.1.1.

When the cells have reached near confluence in the roller bottles, collect the DMEM-10 medium. Depending on the expression level, protein can be harvested from the serum medium (see Note 8).

Wash the cells with 50 mL PBS gently without disturbing the monolayer and remove the PBS.

Add 120 mL of OptiMEM and pump with CO 2 to each roller bottle as described in 3.1.1.1, step 7.

Allow protein secretion for 4-5 days or until the cell starts to detach. Harvest the supernatant as described in section 3.1.1.3.

replacing all buffers to the list in section 2.5.3 and omitting the PBS wash in step 5. The protein concentration and yield can then be estimated. We use the Bradford method (44) to estimate the protein concentration at 595 nm OD. At this point, a small portion of the purified protein can be analyzed on SDS-PAGE follow by coomassie staining (Figure 3 ). Proceed to section 3.3 for molecular weight purification. 8 Harvest the DMEM medium and follow procedures in section 3.1.1.3. Use this medium for S-column purification as described in section 3.2.5. There will still be contaminating serum protein at this stage. Apply the neutralized elution to another round of S-column purification in smaller scale. Scale down all buffers for 2 mL bed volume of S-Agarose. Use 10 mL Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc). The flow rate is entirely depending on gravity. Depending on the expected protein yield, several columns may be required. It is estimated that 1 mL bed volume of S-Agarose is able to capture at least 1 mg sF. We use 3 columns for sF GCN and more than 6 mg can be recovered from supernatant of 10 roller bottles.

Following S-affinity purification, the concentrated purified protein can be analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining to assess the purity and yield. In most cases, there will be presence of small amount of contaminating proteins especially when purification was done from serum medium. Hence, further purification is needed.

Gel filtration chromatography separates molecules on the basis of size. It is often reserved for the final step of purification to achieved higher purity. This method can also be used to estimate the molecular masses of globular proteins in their native condition base on their migration through a chromatographic matrix packed in a column. Pre-packed columns with various matrix of different fractionation range are available commercially from GE healthcare.

The approximate molecular mass of a certain protein can be estimated from a calibrated curve obtained from a series of standards protein with known molecular masses. Standard calibration protein kits can be obtained commercially from e.g. GE healthcare, Sigma, etc with well described calibrating protocols. Once the molecular weight of the different oligomeric species has been determined, a preparative chromatography can be carried out to isolate the desired oligomeric species.

Here, we describe the use of a calibrated Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column to estimate the approximate molecular mass of the different oligomeric species of the soluble viral glycoprotein using example of HeV and NiV sF GCN. We also describe the use of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column XK 16 to separate the different oligomeric species of affinity purified sF.

Chromatography-Before analyzing the soluble viral glycoprotein, calibrate the column with a series of protein standards. The Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column employed here has been calibrated with the Molecular weights (29 KDa -669 KDa) calibration kit. As depicted in Figure 4 , the calibration curve generated was used to estimate the approximate size of the HeV sF GCN. Well described calibrating protocols are included in commercially available gel filtration molecular weights calibration kit. Below is a simple procedure used to determine the approximate size of the sF.

The inlet tubing of the column should be connected to the appropriate buffer through the P-500 pump. Set the back pressure limit to 1.5 MPa.

Connect the column outlet tubing to the optical unit through a flow cell of the UV detector.

Wash the column with at least 3x column volume (3x 24 mL) with sterile deionized water with a flow rate of 24 mL/ hour.

Equilibrate the column with the appropriate protein buffer from section 2.5 with at least 3x of the column volume with the same flow rate.

Set the sensitivity to 1.0 ABS for 3-5 mg of sF, sG, and gp140 and 0.2 ABS for 70 μL of the recommended concentration of the protein standards. Do not exceed 5 mg of protein and 500 μL of sample volume. Apply each protein standards as a separate run.

Set the base line for the UV detector and set the chart speed to 30 cm/hour. Proceed to next step for sample application once a stable base line is observed.

Stop the pump and disconnect the column's inlet tubing from the pump. Apply affinity purified protein or protein standard to the column by using a 1mL syringe and reconnect the input tubing to the pump. Use the same sample volume for all protein standards and the unknown sample.

Start the flow and set the chart speed to 30 cm/hour. Use a flow rate of 24 mL/ hour.

Start fraction collector after the first 3 mL has been eluted. Collect fractions at 60 sec intervals for at least 40 fractions.

Stop collection when the last peak has been observed.

Wash the column with at least 2x column volume of sterile deionized water followed by 3x column volume of 20% Ethanol. Store column in 20% ethanol.

Obtain the elution volume (V e ) by measuring the volume of the eluent from the point of sample application to the center of the elution peak. Determine the void volume (V o ), which is the V e of blue dextran (2 mg/mL).

Calculate the K av values for each protein by using the formula K av = (V e -V o )/ (V c -V o ), where V c is the total column volume.

14. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the calculated K av for each protein standard against the log of the known molecular weight.

Calculate the estimated molecular weight of the soluble viral glycoprotein from the calibrated curve.

16. Take 2 to10 μl from each fraction of all peaks from the soluble glycoprotein for native gel analysis (section 3.5) to observe the oligomeric species. Figure 5 shows a representative result of the elution profile HeV sF GCN and the coomassie blue and western blot of a native gel analysis of the fractions.

Repeat steps 1 to 11 of section 3.3.1 using the of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column. The back pressure limit should be set to 0.3 MPa. The column flow rate should be 60 mL/ hour. Set the sensitivity to1.0 ABS for 8-10 mg of sF, sG, and gp140. Use 3 mL syringe for larger sample volume. The column volume is approximately 120 mL. The chart speed can be set to 15 cm/hour.

Proceed to step 16 of section 3.3.1. Figure 6 shows a representative result of the elution profile HeV sF GCN and the coomassie blue of a native gel analysis of selected peaks.

Pool the selected peak fractions and concentrate it to 1 mL using Centriprep® molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.

Observe 2 to 10 μg the purified protein again on a native gel. Figure 6C shows the purified HeV sF GCN trimer on a native gel.

Native oligomeric forms of the purified soluble glycoprotein can also be analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Figure 6 , two species (large aggregate and trimer) of HeV sF GCN were observed in the sucrose gradient. This is consistent with the gel filtration profile as shown in Figure 4 .

6. Take 15 μL from each fraction for native gel analysis to observe the oligomeric species. Figure 7 shows the western blot of a native gel analysis of the fractions from 200 μg HeV sF GCN.

Native gel analysis allows the visualization of the soluble glycoprotein on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in its native form. This allows the estimation of the size of the native oligomeric species. It is most helpful in analyzing the fractions separated from gel filtration and sucrose gradient.

The Blue native (BN) gel system is based on the originally described system by Schagger and von Jagow (45) . Many modifications have been made based on the original method for example in observing the native forms of HIV-1 Env (30, 46, 47) . We find that the commercially available BN-PAGE system from Invitrogen Corp. is most suitable for our soluble glycoprotein analysis. It requires little or no optimization and is included with well described step by step protocol. In this BN-PAGE system, the Coomassie ® G-250 binds to proteins and confers a negative charge while maintaining the proteins in their Native state.

Below are the procedures we use to analyze our soluble glycoproteins using the BN-PAGE system followed by western blotting.

Comparative immunological evaluation of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains expressing model antigens as live oral vaccines,"Background: Despite the development of various systems to generate live recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains, little work has been performed to systematically evaluate and compare their relative immunogenicity. Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines.","Result: To compare vaccine strains encoded with different antigen delivery and expression strategies, a series of recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium strains were constructed that expressed either the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a fragment of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the H5N1 influenza virus, as model antigens. The antigens were expressed from the chromosome, from high or low-copy plasmids, or encoded on a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Antigens were targeted for expression in either the cytoplasm or the outer membrane. Combinations of strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of combined delivery/expression approaches. After investigating in vitro and in vivo antigen expression, growth and infection abilities; the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains was evaluated in mice. Using the soluble model antigen EGFP, our results indicated that vaccine strains with high and stable antigen expression exhibited high B cell responses, whilst eukaryotic expression or colonization with good construct stability was critical for T cell responses. For the insoluble model antigen HA, an outer membrane expression strategy induced better B cell and T cell responses than a cytoplasmic strategy. Most notably, the combination of two different expression strategies did not increase the immune response elicited. Conclusion: Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant Salmonella strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages and deleterious or synergistic effects. Different construction strategies were optimally-required for soluble versus insoluble forms of the protein antigens. If an antigen, such as EGFP, is soluble and expressed at high levels, a low-copy plasmid-cytoplasmic expression strategy is recommended; since it provokes the highest B cell responses and also induces good T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic expression plasmid or a chromosome-based, cytoplasmic-expression strategy is more effective. For insoluble antigens such as HA, an outer membrane expression strategy is recommended.

Keywords: Salmonella Typhimurium, Live oral vaccine, Soluble and insoluble antigens, Construction strategies, Immunological comparison Background Over recent years, there has been considerable interest in the use of attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strains as live oral vaccines against heterologous antigens or infectious agents [1, 2] . Notable advantages to their use include their ability to induce antigen-specific mucosal, humoral and cellular responses after infecting the host via mucosal routes [3] [4] [5] . Salmonella strains can be orally administrated, via food or drinking water, which avoids the use of injections for vaccine delivery. Furthermore, vaccine strains may be conveniently and reliably generated in large quantities by standard cell culture-based approaches, which considerably lowers the manufacturing costs [6] . Consequently, many different strategies have been utilized for the development of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines against various heterologous antigens. Some of these approaches utilize episomal expression systems, where high or low copy plasmids are used to express heterologous antigen or epitope genes under the control of various different promoter systems [7] [8] [9] [10] . The antigenic proteins may be retained within the cell cytoplasm after expression, or may be targeted to cell surface (outer membrane) of the attenuated Salmonella strains. For example, the Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and codon-optimized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein have both been expressed in the cytoplasm of attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium cells via high copy plasmids, for use as live oral vaccine candidates against Streptococcus pneumonia or the H5N1 virus [7, 8] , respectively. A high copy ice-nucleation protein (Inp) derived surface-expressed system was employed to produce a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against hepatitis B virus, while a low copy OmpA-derived surface display system was used to develop a live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccine against HIV [9, 10] . All of these vaccines were demonstrated to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses. In other studies, heterologous genes have been expressed in the cytoplasm of attenuated Salmonella via chromosome-based expression cassettes. For instance, a live recombinant Salmonella strain containing a chromosomally-encoded SARS-CoV nucleocapsid gene expressed sufficient cytoplasmic protein to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV [11] . Salmonella has also been employed as a live delivery vector for eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring antigen genes. This strategy may avoid problems such as codon bias or low levels of antigen expression. Using this approach, live recombinant Salmonella was used to deliver an HA DNA vaccine against the H9N2 virus, and a VP28 DNA vaccine against the white spot syndrome virus in crayfish [12, 13] .

In several reports, two or three different approaches have been used to construct analogous live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines that target the same pathogen, and their respective immunogenicities were subsequently compared. In studies aimed at developing a live oral Salmonella vaccine against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, identical Adh and NrdF antigen genes were expressed using either plasmid-or chromosome-based systems. Animal tests suggested that the vaccine strain containing the chromosome-based expression system induced a stronger humoral immune response than the one containing the plasmid-based expression system [14] . Similarly, in efforts to construct a live oral Salmonella-HIV vaccine, the HIV rgp120 antigen was expressed cytoplasmically using either a chromosome-based cassette, a high copy plasmid, or in the outer membrane via an OmpA expression system. Animal experiments subsequently revealed that the membrane-expressed HIV antigen was capable of inducing a better humoral response than the cytoplasmically-expressed HIV antigen expressed using the other two expression systems [10] .

The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), originally isolated from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish, is an easily expressed, soluble and species-independent reporter protein, which emits green florescence after absorbing blue light. Its intracellular expression levels and location can be conveniently monitored by fluorescence microscopy, using a fluorescence micro-plate reader, or by fluorescence-assisted flow cytometry. Furthermore, it has been reported that it contains a mouse H2-K d -restricted CTL epitope, which could elicit a strong immune response [15] . All of these characteristics suggest that EGFP could be a good vaccine model antigen in mice [16] .

Despite the development of numerous strategies for the construction of Salmonella vaccine strains, there have been relatively few studies aimed at systematically evaluating and comparing their respective immunogenic properties. Such information would provide invaluable guidance for the future rational design of live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines. To directly address this issue, we construct analogous sets of live recombinant Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains expressing two model antigens: enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the hemagglutinin epitope (residues 91-261, HAOP) from H5N1 virus (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004), via different commonly used strategies. Through systematically evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of these strains in mice, we identified their respective advantages, as well as deleterious or synergistic effects. The construction strategies of recombinant Salmonella vaccine strains for various needs and different forms of antigens (soluble or insoluble antigens) were also proposed. strategy in a single chromosomal or episomal context, respectively (Table 1) . Strains HP, LP and CP were each designed to express EGFP in the cytoplasm of Salmonella from a high copy plasmid, low copy plasmid or chromosome-based prosseA expression cassette, respectively. Strains HO and CO were designed to express EGFP on the outer membrane of SL7207 from a high copy plasmid, or a chromosome-based prosseA-lpp-ompA outer membrane expression cassette, respectively. Strain E carried a high-copy eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP driven by a eukaryotic cmv promoter. Consequently, EGFP would not be expected to be expressed in significant amounts until pEGFP was released into cells of the eukaryotic host. HP and HO sub-groups were constructed by using the high copy number plasmid with pUC origin as backbone. These plasmids exist in about 500-700 copies in one bacterial cell [17] . Low copy number plasmid sub-group LP was constructed using p15A origin in the backbone. The plasmid exists in 10-12 copies per bacterial cell [17] . Chromosomebased sub-groups CP and CO were constructed by lambda red recombineering [18] which resulted in only one copy of EGFP expressing cassette in one bacterial cell. The high-copy eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP also uses pUC origin as backbone.

Five additional 'double-recombinant' Salmonella-EGFP strains were then constructed, by combining two of the above strategies (Table 1) . Four of them were created from the chromosome-based EGFP expression strain, CP. This was achieved by establishing the pHP, pLP, pHO, or pEGFP plasmids within CP, generating the double-recombinant CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and CP + E strains, respectively. The pEGFP plasmid was transformed into the LP strain to generate a further double-recombinant strain, E + LP.

In vitro and in vivo EGFP expression of recombinant Salmonella strains Detection of EGFP expression and cell morphology of recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains Out of the six 'single-recombinant' Salmonella-EGFP strains, green fluorescence could be directly observed in cells of the HP, LP, CP and HO strains by fluorescent microscopic analysis ( Figure 1A ). Since no fluorescence was observable for the CO strain, EGFP expression was confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 1C ). This revealed that the EGFP gene was being translated within the CO strain. Because EGFP would not be expressed in significant amounts until pEGFP in strain E was released into eukaryotic cells, we detected its expression at different time points in vitro and in vivo, respectively, using Western blotting. In vitro, the EGFP expression was detected by infecting the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line with E strain. Figure 1D showed that EGFP could be successfully delivered into eukaryotic cells by E strain in vitro, and its expression was found within the eukaryotic cells at 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection. Furthermore, the EGFP expression delivered by E strain was also investigated in mice intestine on day 1, 3 and 7 after inoculation of 1 × 10 11 bacterial cells. Western blotting result ( Figure 1E ) showed that EGFP expression was observed in mice intestinal mucosa on day 1 after inoculation.

Filamentation of bacterial cell (the elongated, rod-like cell morphology) was clearly observable for the HP, HO and E strains. Consequently, the average cell lengths for each of the created strains were determined using the Image J software package, and were compared with those of the parent SL7207 strain. It is shown in Figure 2A that the average lengths of the HP, HO and E strains were 8.1 μm, 6.0 μm and 5.5 μm, respectively, which was considerably longer than the average length of the SL7207 cells, which was 2.5 μm [19] .

Levels of EGFP-derived green fluorescence in the five double-recombinant strains were similarly analyzed by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1B ). Fluorescence could be clearly observed for cells of each of the five strains. With the exception of the CP + LP strain, cells were highly elongated compared with the SL7207 strain. Analysis of average cell length using Image J software ( Figure 2A ) indicated that cell filamentation of E + LP strain were the most highly elongated; with an average length of 15.7 μm. CP + HP, CP + HO and CP + E cells were also significantly filamented, with average lengths of 6.2 μm, 3.2 μm and 7.3 μm, respectively.

To quantify EGFP expression levels within the eleven recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains, the intensity of green fluorescence for 1 × 10 8 freshly cultured planktonic cells were determined using a micro-plate reader ( Figure 2B ). For the three 'cytoplasmic expression' single-recombinant strains (i.e. HP, LP, and CP), there were clear differences in fluorescence levels. The HP strain exhibited the highest fluorescence intensity levels (1.9 × 10 3 a.u.), followed by LP (5.6 × 10 2 a.u.), with CP being barely fluorescent (11 a.u.) . For the two membrane-based expression strains, fluorescence levels were only significant for the HO strain (68 a.u.), with the CO strain (2 a.u.) being essentially non-fluorescent; practically the same as the SL7207 strain (1 a.u.). Fluorescence levels for the E strain, which carries the eukaryotic EGFP-expression plasmid, were similarly negligible (2 a.u.). These results clearly indicated that the fluorescence intensities observed within freshly cultured, planktonic cells were highest for the cytoplasmicexpression strains, and were also positively correlated to the plasmid copy numbers. The data also match the phenotypes of the strains, as observed using fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1A ). In summary, the EGFPexpression levels in the six 'single-recombinant' Salmonella strains were in the order (highest to lowest): HP > LP > HO > CP > CO and E (p < 0.01).

The intensities of EGFP fluorescence in the five 'double-recombinant' strains were not enhanced, as had initially been expected ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, for four of the five double-recombinant strains, green fluorescence intensities were significantly lower than in the respective single-recombinant parent strains. The fluorescence intensity of the CP + HP strain (5.6 × 10 2 a.u.) was more than three-fold lower than the parent HP strain (1.9 × 10 3 a.u., p < 0.01). The fluorescence of the CP + HO strain (11 a.u.) was essentially identical to the CP parent (11 a.u.) , and more than 6-fold lower than were generally greatly reduced, when compared to their parental strains; being listed in the following order: CP + HP, CP + LP > E + LP > CP + HO > CP + E (p < 0.01).

In order to investigate whether single and double recombinant strategies would affect the growth of recombinant strains which may further influence bacterial infection abilities in vivo, the doubling times of the six single and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were measured in liquid LB medium supplemented with antibiotics in vitro. Table 2 shows the growth rates of the six singlerecombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains. The doubling times of the HP, LP, CP, HO, CO and E strains were 33.2 ± 4.0, 39.2 ± 1.5, 44.2 ± 2.6, 38.9 ± 3.0, 52.5 ± 2.6 and 33.0 ± 3.0 minutes, respectively. Their doubling times were all significantly higher than that of the parental strain SL7207 (26.3 ± 0.9 min, p < 0.05). Comparing the six recombinant strains, the growth rate of the chromosome-based outer-membrane strain CO was considerably slower than that of the other five strains (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the growth rates of strains containing high or low copy-EGFP plasmids were also compared with those of strains containing the corresponding empty vectors. Strains HP and E exhibited similar growth rates to the strains containing the corresponding empty vectors BSK (35.0 ± 1.4 min) and VAX-1 (31.2 ± 1.9 min). This indicated that the metabolic burden associated with maintaining the pBSK and pVAX-1 high copy plasmids was primarily responsible for the increase in doubling times for the HP and E strains. The growth rates of the LP and HO strains were considerably different to those of the corresponding empty-vector strains ACYC177 (42.8 ± 1.7 min, p < 0.01) and OmpA (35.8 ± 1.2 min, p < 0.05). This suggested that both EGFP expression and plasmid burden affected their growth rates.

The growth rates of five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were also measured, and are described in Table 3 . The doubling times of strains CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E, E + LP were: 58.3 ± 2.5, 51.0 ± 2.3, 105.9 ± 7.4, 65.7 ± 2.5 and 68.3 ± 9.9 minutes, respectively. These values were considerably higher than the doubling time of the SL7207 strain (p < 0.01). Also, we found that their growth rates were significantly slower than those of the corresponding single-recombinant parental strains (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05; described in Table 3 ). The growth rate of strain VAX-1 + ACYC177, which contains two empty vectors: pVAX-1 and pEGFP, was measured as a control for the E + LP strain. Experiments revealed that there were no significant differences in the growth rates of these two strains. Taken together, these results indicated that double-recombinant strategies seriously reduced the growth rates of these five strains comparing to that of strains with single strategies and SL7207.

To maximize plasmid stability and copy-number within the recombinant strains, two strategies were used. Firstly, Each bar in the graph represents the mean length of 20 bacterial cells randomly selected from multiple microscopic fields for each strain, as measured using Image J software. Error bars show the standard deviation. An asterisk indicates that the mean length of the cells were significantly different from those of the SL7207 parent strain, as determined by Student T-test (P < 0.05). (B) Intensity of EGFP fluorescence emitted by each of the eleven recombinant Salmonella strains. SL7207 was included as a negative control. Measurements correspond to the average fluorescence emitted by 1 × 10 8 freshly-cultured bacterial cells (in 96-well micro-titer plates; excitation 488 nm, emission 518 nm); time resolved fluorescence of 500 ms. Bars in the graph represent the average fluorescence intensities from three independent experiments, ± standard deviation.

antibiotics were supplied throughout the entire experimental process. Secondly, all strains were freshly cultured for 10 hours, diluted 1:10 with fresh medium, and then cultured until the OD 600 reached 2 a.u. Immediately prior to oral administration, the stability of the EGFP expression constructs within each of the eleven Salmonella-EGFP strains were evaluated using colony forming unit (CFU) assays. Table 4 summarizes the results of these assays, which evaluate the retention of functional antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes within the six single-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains. Three plasmids (pLP, pHO, pEGFP) and two chromosome-based expression cassettes (CP and CO strains) exhibited good stability, with 100.0% survival rate on the selection plates. However, for the HP strain, only 88.9% of CFUs maintained pHP. This indicated that EGFP expression in the HP strain may be less stable than the other strains, thereby possibly affecting its immunogenic potency.

Since the reduction in EGFP expression levels for the five double-recombinant strains may be related to the relative stability of the two EGFP expression cassettes, their respective stabilities were also evaluated using CFU assays, performed immediately prior to oral administration. It may be seen in Table 5 that both expression cassettes were only completely stable (i.e. detected in 100.0% of CFUs) in two of the five double-recombinant strains: CP + LP and CP + E. The chromosome-based EGFP expression cassettes (from the parent CP strain) as well as the low-copy plasmids (p15A-replicons, in the LP strains) appeared to be very stable, with a 100.0% detection rate. However, the high copy plasmids (pUCreplicons) in the double-recombinant strains were significantly less stable. The detection rates for pHP in the CP + HP strain, pHO in the CP + HO strain, and pEGFP in the E + LP strain were 0.8%, 60.0% and 50.0%, respectively. Even though the p15A and pUC-based plasmids should be entirely compatible within the double-recombinant E + LP strain (and maintained using orthogonal antibiotic resistance strategies), the highcopy plasmid exhibited poorer stability. It may be noted that the relative differences in fluorescence levels between the single and double-recombinant strains ( Figure 2B ) correlates-well with the plasmid stability properties revealed by the CFU assays (Table 5 ).

To evaluate the survival and infection abilities of the six single-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains and the stabilities of the EGFP expression constructs in vivo; fecal samples, as well as spleen and mesenteric lymph node samples were collected from each group of mice on days 1, 3 and 7 after the oral administration of 1 × 10 11 bacterial cells, respectively. CFU assays were carried out using LB agar plates with or without the appropriate antibiotics. The SL7207 strain was treated identically as a control.

Enumeration of CFUs in feces [ Figure 3A (1)] showed that 10 5 -10 9 cfu/g of the Salmonella cells were present on day one, for the seven administration groups. The CP strain was present in the highest levels in the feces, with 10 9 cfu/g (p < 0.01). The stability assays [ Figure 3A (2)] suggested that the chromosome-based expression strains (CP and CO), as well as the strain with the low copy plasmid (LP), exhibited good stabilities, with 100.0% survival rates on the selection plates. However, strains containing the high copy prokaryotic or eukaryotic plasmids: HP, HO and E, appeared to be less stable; with detection rates of 35.0% (p < 0.01), 90% and 72.2%, respectively. On day 3, fecal bacterial cells in the seven administration groups declined to 10 3 -10 7 cfu/g. The CP strain still exhibited the best survival ability, with 10 7 cfu/g (p < 0.01). Regarding the stability of the constructs, the CP and CO strains remain good stability, with 100% detection rates on the antibiotic selection plates. But the low copy plasmid within the LP strain was somewhat less stable, declining from 100% to 68.9%. Furthermore, there was a considerable loss of the high copy plasmids within the HP, HO and E strains. Only 2.9% and 7.5% of CFUs corresponding to the HP and E strains contained * The doubling time of the SL7207 strain was significantly different from those of the six single-recombinant strains (p < 0.05); ** The doubling time of the CO strain was significantly increased compared to those of the other five single-recombinant strains (p < 0.01); (a) A significant difference was observed between the doubling times of the LP strain and the strain containing the corresponding empty vector ACYC177 (p < 0.01); (b) The doubling times of the HO and OmpA strains are significantly different (p < 0.05).

high copy plasmids, respectively, whilst the pHO plasmid in the HO strain declined to very low levels that could not be accurately calculated. The HP, HO and E recombinant strains were significantly less stable than the CP, CO and LP strains (p < 0.01). On day 7, fecal bacterial cells from the six recombinant groups decreased to very low levels, of around 10 3 -10 4 cfu/g, whilst the SL7207 group showed the best reserve, at around 10 5 cfu/g (p < 0.01). Since construct stability could not be accurately calculated at these low levels, this data is not shown here. In summary, the CP chromosome-based expression strain exhibited the highest survival abilities in feces on day 1 and 3 after inoculation. The high copy prokaryotic or eukaryotic plasmids in the HP, HO and E strains appeared to be less stable in fecal samples than the chromosomebased expression cassettes in the CP and CO strains, or the low copy plasmid in the LP strain. The infection abilities of six single-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were determined by detecting their presence within the mouse spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes, using the SL7207 strain as a control. Figure 3B (1) & (2) shows the spleen infection results for the recombinant strains. On day 1, spleen infection was observed in the SL7207, LP, CP and CO groups. For the SL7207 group, Salmonella was found in 66.7% of mice spleens (4 out of 6 mice) with an average of 4 × 10 5 cfu/g. 83.3% of mice (5 out of 6 mice) in the LP group were infected with Salmonella, with an average of 4 × 10 5 cfu/g. The detection rate for the low copy plasmid was 100.0%. For the CP and CO groups, the spleen infection rates were 66.7% (4 out of 6 mice) and 50.0%

(3 out of 6 mice); with an average of 2 × 10 5 cfu/g and 8 × 10 4 cfu/g, respectively. Their chromosome-based expression cassettes showed good stabilities, with detection rates of 96.9% and 100.0%, respectively. However, no Salmonella infection could be detected for the HP, HO and E strains, which contained the high copy prokaryotic or eukaryotic plasmids. On day 3, the spleen infection levels for the recombinant strains had significantly declined; however, the spleen infection rate in the SL7207 group increased to 100.0% (6 out of 6 mice) with an average of 2 × 10 5 cfu/g. Only 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the HP and CP groups had Salmonella infections in their spleen; with 1 × 10 3 cfu/g and 9 × 10 3 cfu/g, respectively. The construct detection rate in HP group was 0, while that in the CP group was 100.0%. For the LP group, the spleen infection rate declined to 50% (3 out of 6 mice) with an average of 4 × 10 4 cfu/g. The low copy plasmid stability also declined to 30.0%. Even so, the spleen infection rate for the LP group was still higher than those for the HO, CO and E groups; for which no infection was observed. On day 7, the spleen infection rate in the SL7207 administration group was still 100.0%, with an average of 7 × 10 5 cfu/g. For the HP and HO groups, 83.3% of mice spleens (5 out of 6 mice) tested positive for Salmonella infection, with an average 3 × 10 3 of cfu/g. However, no high copy plasmids could be detected in cells of either of these two strains. For the CO and E strains, only 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) had spleens infected with Salmonella cells, with 3 × 10 5 cfu/g and 3 × 10 3 cfu/g, respectively. The stability of the chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain remained at 100.0%, but no pEGFP plasmid could be isolated in the E group. Taken together, the results showed that all six of the recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains could infect the spleen, but at different time points. The spleen infection rates for the recombinant strains were noticeably lower than those for the SL7207 group on day 3 and day 7. On day one, the LP low copy plasmid strain, and the CP and CO strains containing the chromosome-based expression cassettes had higher spleen infection rates with good stability, compared to the HP, HO and E strains containing high copy prokaryotic or eukaryotic plasmids. Even though infection was observed, the strains containing high copy prokaryotic Table 5 Stability of antibiotic markers in the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains in mice spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes on days 1, 3 and 7 after inoculation, respectively.

or eukaryotic plasmid had noticeably poorer stability on day 7. The mesenteric lymph node infection results for the recombinant strains are shown in Figure 3C (1) & (2). On day 1, Salmonella infections were observed in the SL7207, LP, CP, HO and CO groups; while no infection was detected in the HP and E groups. Only 16.7% mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the SL7207 and CO groups had Salmonella infection in their lymph nodes, with levels of 1 × 10 4 cfu/g and 9 × 10 3 cfu/g, respectively. The detection rate for the chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain was 100.0%. In the LP group, the lymph node infection rate was 33.3% (2 out of 6 mice), with an average of 2 × 10 3 cfu/g. For the CP and HO groups, 50.0% of the lymph nodes (3 out of 6 mice) tested positive for Salmonella infection, with an average of 4 × 10 3 cfu/g and 2 × 10 4 cfu/g, respectively. The stability of the EGFP expression cassettes in the LP, CP and HO groups were 92.9%, 100.0% and 73.3%, respectively. On day 3, 33.3% of mice (2 out of 6) in the SL7207 and LP groups had lymph node infections, with an average of 2 × 10 3 cfu/g and 5 × 10 3 cfu/g, respectively. The detection rate for low copy plasmids in the LP strain was 75%. In the HP group, only 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) tested positive for Salmonella infection, with an average of 3 × 10 3 cfu/g; however, no pHP plasmid could be isolated. For the other four groups (CP, HO, CO and E), no Salmonella infection was detected in the lymph nodes. On day 7, the lymph node infection rates in the SL7207 and HP groups were 33.3% (2 out of 6 mice) with an average of 8 × 10 4 cfu/g and 2 × 10 3 cfu/g, respectively. The detection rate for the high copy plasmid pHP was only 5.0%. For the CO group, 16.7% mice (1 out of 6 mice) tested positive for Salmonella infection in the lymph nodes, with average levels of 7 × 10 4 cfu/g. The stability of the chromosome-based expression cassette within the CO strain was 85.7%. Furthermore, the infection rate for the E group increased to 66.7%, with average counts of 1 × 10 3 cfu/g. However, the detection rate for the high copy plasmid pEGFP was only 25.0%. Considering these results as a whole, all the recombinant strains were able to infect the mice mesenteric lymph nodes at different time points; however, very few high copy plasmids could be detected in the plasmid-based recombinant strains on day 7.

In vivo immune response to recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains EGFP-specific IgG responses in infected mouse sera

In order to compare the humoral immune responses mounted against eleven recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains, ELISA assays were performed to test the anti-EGFP IgG responses using blood sera of infected mice on the 7 th , 28 th and 42 th day after immunization.

Results ( Figure 4A ) indicated that anti-EGFP IgG responses of mice immunized with six singlerecombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were very weak on the 7 th day after immunization. Only two mice, from the LP and E groups respectively, had a 1:500 anti-EGFP IgG titer. After receiving boosts on day 21 and 35, the anti-EGFP IgG responses in the mice were greatly increased. In the cytoplasmic expression group (HP, LP and CP), 50.0% of mice (3 of the 6 mice) in the HP subgroup had elevated anti-EGFP IgG responses. The average titers were around 1:21,000 on days 28 and 42. 100.0% of mice (all 9 mice) in the LP subgroup had strong anti-EGFP IgG responses, and the highest titer reached 1:200,000. The average titers were 1:47,000 on day 28, and 1:65,000 on day 42. Notably, no response could be detected in the CP subgroup even after two boosts. In the membrane-based expression group, the response rate for anti-EGFP IgG in the HO subgroup was 44.4% (4 out of 9 mice) with an average titer of 1:390 on day 28, and 55.6% (5 out of 9 mice) with an average titer 1:500 on day 42. Only 12.5% of mice (1 of 8 mice) in the CO subgroup had an anti-EGFP IgG response, with a titer of 1:100 on day 28, and 1:500 on day 42. In the eukaryotic expression plasmid group, only 20.0% of mice (1 of 5 mice) responded, having a 1:10,000 anti-EGFP IgG titer on day 28, and a 1: 25,000 titer on day 42. Collectively, based on the response rates, anti-EGFP IgG response of strains containing either high or low-copy prokaryotic expression plasmids were much better than those containing a chromosome-based expression cassette or an eukaryotic expression plasmid; especially the LP strain, which had significantly higher average anti-EGFP IgG titers on day 42 (p < 0.05).

Humoral immune response assays were also performed for the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains, to investigate whether these two-gene constructs were capable of inducing stronger B cell responses. The results from analogous sets of ELISA experiments are shown in Figure 4B . Anti-EGFP IgG responses in all five mice groups were very weak on 7 th day after immunization. Only 14.3% of mice (1 of 7 mice) in the CP + HP group and 16.7% of mice (1 out of 6 mice) in the E + LP group generated a humoral response, with titres of 1:100 and 1:1,000, respectively. After two boosts on day 21 and 35, the response rate for anti-EGFP IgG in each group had increased. 28.6% of mice (2 of 7 mice) in the CP + HP group had anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:1,400 on day 28, and 1:1,500 on day 42. In the CP + LP group, 60.0% of mice (3 out of 5 mice) had anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:700 on day 28, and 1:2,500 on day 42. For the CP + HO strain, only 16.7% of mice (1 mouse out of 6) had developed a response by day 28; and by day 42, 33.3% (2 of 6 mice) had mounted anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of ca. 1:330. In the E + LP group, 33.3% of mice (2 out of 6 mice) developed anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:17,000 on day 28; and 50.0% of mice (3 out of 6 mice) generated anti-EGFP IgG responses, with average titers of 1:35,000 on day 42. Notably, no response could be detected in the CP + E group even after two boosts. In brief summary, up to day 42, the humoral response rates against the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains did not increase as was initially expected. They were lower than the humoral response rates observed for the respective single-recombinant parental strains.

The T cell anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses against the eleven recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were also determined within immunized mice. An equally sized group of uninfected mice was included as a negative control. The anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses were evaluated by determining the ratio of ELISpot numbers counted for the respective groups of immunized mice, divided by the numbers counted for the control mice. Figure 4C summarizes the ELISpot results obtained for the six single-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains. For the cytoplasmic expression group, the average ratios . ELISA assays were performed using mice sera collected on day 7, 28 and 42. * underneath the LP strain in (A) indicates the mean ELISA titer raised by LP strain is significantly higher than those of other strain, as determined by One-Way ANOVA (P < 0.05).

Each ▲ represents one mouse. In (A) and (B), red lines indicate the average titers for each strain. In (C) and (D), red lines indicate the average ratios for each strain.

for the HP, LP and CP subgroups were 4.40, 6.51 and 14.05, respectively. For the membrane expression group (HO and CO), the CO subgroup had an average ratio of 6.39, whilst a ratio of 0.92 was obtained for the HO subgroup. The eukaryotic expression plasmid strain (E) generated anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses with an average ratio of 16.55. Comparing the average ratios obtained for the six recombinant strains, the strains containing the eukaryotic expression plasmid (E) or the chromosome-based expression cassette (CP) were capable of inducing stronger anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses than strains containing high-copy prokaryotic plasmids (HP and HO) (p < 0.05). Interestingly, this general trend is almost the opposite of that noted for the humoral immune responses.

The anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses raised by the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were also evaluated, to investigate whether strains containing two EGFP expression cassettes induced stronger T cell responses than the corresponding single-recombinant strains. As shown in Figure 4D , when CP was combined with HP, LP, HO, or E, the average ratios of anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses in mice were 5.33, 1.61, 9.90 and 2.87, respectively. The average ratio of anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses for the E + LP immunized mice versus the control set was 4.95. In summary, the T cell responses against the five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains had not been enhanced as was initially expected. Responses against several strains, such as CP + LP, CP + E and E + LP, were significantly lower than the respective single-recombinant parental strains CP and E (p < 0.05).

In the first set of experiments, EGFP was used as a model antigen to study and compare the immunogenic potency of various recombinant Salmonella strains, since previous studies have shown this protein to be highly expressed in a soluble form within Salmonella [20] [21] [22] . However, many other heterologous antigens, such as viral proteins, may not be readily expressed in Salmonella in a soluble form, due to factors such as codon bias, amino acid composition or protein stability. Therefore, we chose the HA epitope (91aa-261aa) from the avian influenza H5N1 virus as a second model antigen. Considering the codon bias between Salmonella and influenza virus, the gene sequence encoding the HA fragment (HAOP) was first codon optimized for expression within Salmonella, and prepared synthetically by a commercial supplier (GenScript). The HAOP fragment was subcloned into sets of plasmids analogous to those used for the EGFP gene, in order to construct analogous expression systems within the parental Salmonella SL7207 strain.

For cytoplasmic expression, HAOP was subcloned into the pBSK-derived plasmid (pHP), placing it under the control of the prosseA promoter (plasmid pHAOP). For outer membrane expression, HAOP was subcloned into the pHO plasmid to generate pO-HAOP. These two constructs were separately transformed into SL7207, to create a cytoplasmic HA expression strain of Salmonella (C-HAOP) as well as an outer-membrane HA expression strain of Salmonella (O-HAOP). The expression of HAOP in these two recombinant strains was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As may be seen in Figure 5A , HAOP was highly expressed within the C-HAOP strain, being present almost exclusively in the pellet fraction after cell lysis. This indicates that it may be predominantly localized within insoluble inclusion bodies in the cell cytoplasm. For the strain O-HAOP, Western blot analysis of cell-membrane extracts demonstrated that the expressed HAOP was associated with the outer membrane ( Figure 5B ).

In vivo immune response to recombinant Salmonella-HA strains Humoral immune response

The humoral immune responses in mice infected with the C-HAOP and O-HAOP strains were investigated using ELISA assays analogous to those performed for the EGFP antigen. We evaluated the anti-HA IgG levels present in blood sera taken from mice infected with C-HAOP and O-HAOP on the 7 th , 28 th and 42 th day after initial immunization. ELISA results suggested that the C-HAOP strain could not elicit an anti-HA IgG response, even after two boosts; giving readings identical to the HO (EGFP) negative control strain (data not shown). Results from ELISA analyses of the mice infected with the O-HAOP strain ( Figure 5C ), revealed that only 10.0% mice (1 out of 10 mice) had a 1: 1000 anti-H5 IgG titer on day 7. After the first boost, 30.0% mice (3 out of 10 mice) had anti-H5 IgG responses with titers of 1:1000, 1:500 and 1:50 (average 1:160) on day 28. After the second boost, the 30.0% mice (3 out of 10 mice) had increased anti-H5 IgG responses; two mice having titers of 1:1000, and one with a titer of 1:500 (average titer of 1:250) on day 42. By day 42, O-HAOP strain exhibited better humoral immunogenicity (including response rate and anti-HA IgG titer) than C-HAOP strain (p < 0.05).

Hemagglutination Inhibition Assays (HIA) HIA tests were performed using blood sera from mice infected with O-HAOP strain on the 42 nd day (i.e. after 3 identical immunizations: one prime and two boosts; same schedule as above). Blood sera from non-infected mice, as well as those analogously immunized with the HO (EGFP) strain were used as negative controls. Results ( Figure 5D ) indicated that sera taken from 50.0% O-HAOP-infected mice (5 out of 10 mice) contained neutralization antibodies with titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:128 (average titer of 1:30). The HIA titers within the O-HAOP-infected mice were significantly different to those obtained for the noninfected group (p < 0.05).

Salmonella-HA strains As performed for the Salmonella-EGFP strains, T cell anti-HA IFN-γ responses raised against the two recombinant Salmonella-HA strains (C-HAOP and O-HAOP) were evaluated using ELISpot assays. Noninfected mice as well as HO-infected mice were used as negative controls.

Analogous to before, the anti-HA IFN-γ responses were evaluated by determining the ratio of ELISpot numbers counted for the C-HAOP, O-HAOP or HO infected mice, divided by the number counted for the non-infected control set ( Figure 5E ). It was found that the C-HAOP strain could not induce an anti-HA IFN-γ response, with an average ratio of 0.91 obtained, versus 0.69 determined for the HO-infected group. However, the O-HAOP strain elicited a better anti-HA IFN-γ response comparing to the HO and C-HAOP groups (p < 0.05), yielding an average ratio of 2.56.

The use of recombinant Salmonella strains as live attenuated vaccines has been attracting increasing interest over recent years, due to the low cost and relative ease by which they may be produced on a large scale. [23] [24] [25] . Although numerous Salmonella vaccine systems have been developed, relatively little work has been carried out to systematically investigate which approaches or construction methods reproducibly produce recombinant strains with the highest immunogenicity levels. Here, we used EGFP as a model antigen to study the relationship between immunogenicity and the use of different antigen expression systems in Salmonella. Six recombinant strains, including three cytoplasmic expression strains (HP, LP and CP); two outer-membrane expression strains (HO, CO) and one eukaryotic expression plasmid (strain E), were constructed. Several different pairs of EGFP-expression systems were combined, to produce five additional 'double-recombinant' strains. The antigen expression levels; in vitro and in vivo growth and infection abilities; and the immunogenic properties of these single and double-recombinant strains in mice; were systematically investigated, in order to evaluate their respective advantages, and to identify deleterious or synergistic effects.

Within the set of three single-recombinant strains designed for cytoplasmic expression of antigen protein, the high copy plasmid pHP produced the highest amounts of EGFP within the HP cells in vitro ( Figure 2B ); resulting in relatively strong B cell responses (anti-EGFP IgG response rate, Figure 4A ), even though the plasmid itself did not exhibit good stability in vitro and in vivo (Table 4 and Figure 3 ). Although the EGFP expression levels in the LP strain (containing the lowcopy pLP plasmid) were lower than those in the HP strain, LP elicited a better B cell response, which is probably due to high EGFP expression and improved plasmid stability in vitro and in vivo. The CP strain, which contains a (single-copy) chromosome-based expression cassette, produced lower levels of EGFP expression than the HP and LP strains, and induced a weaker B cell response rate than these two strains. Out of the two single-recombinant strains designed for outer membrane expression, the HO strain, which harbors the high copy number pHO plasmid, expressed higher levels of EGFP than the chromosome-based CO strain in vitro, and also elicited better B cell response rate. The EGFP expression levels in the HO strain were lower than those in HP or LP, the high copy plasmid pHO showed poor in vivo stability (as did pHP), and it also induced a weaker B cell response than the LP strain. The B cell response rate against the E strain, which harbors a eukaryotic expression plasmid, were weaker than those raised by the HP, LP and HO strains; most likely because the EGFP cannot be expressed until pEGFP has entered a host cell. In addition, the eukaryotic plasmid expression levels may not be as high as those generated by Salmonella strains containing high or low copy prokaryotic plasmids. Taken together, these findings suggest the strength of the humoral immunity responses in mice infected with recombinant Salmonella vaccines were positively correlated to antigen expression levels and plasmid stability. Therefore, maintaining high and stable antigen expression levels in recombinant Salmonella strains is of key importance for eliciting a strong B cell response. Furthermore, our results indicate that strains containing low copy prokaryotic plasmids are capable of generating highest B cell responses with relative high antigen expression level and improved stability over high-copy plasmids.

During previous efforts to develop live recombinant Salmonella oral vaccines, the expression of heterologous antigens within Salmonella cells was achieved mainly through the use of multi-copy prokaryotic plasmids which contain the antigen of interest under the control of a prokaryotic promoter. Plasmids with various copy numbers have been used [26, 27] . In several cases, such as the construction of live attenuated Salmonella oral vaccines against Streptococcus pneumonia, the H5N1 virus or hepatitis B virus; the antigens of interest expressed from high copy prokaryotic plasmids were able to induce strong immune responses, especially humoral responses [7] [8] [9] . However, many of these vaccine strains had either negligible or fairly low immunogenicity, due to the instability of the high copy plasmid, or toxic effects induced by the unregulated high-level expression of these heterologous antigens [28] [29] [30] . Plasmids may be stably maintained in Salmonella cells during in vitro growth via the use of the appropriate antibiotic. However, the loss of high copy plasmids may easily occur once Salmonella infects and grows inside the host, due to the absence of antibiotic selection pressure; thereby resulting in reduced antigen expression levels and decreased immunogenicity in vivo. Also, the unregulated high level expression of antigen may create a significant metabolic burden, or even toxicity for the Salmonella cell, thus creating a selective pressure for high copy plasmid segregation during cell division [27] . Here, the LP strain, which contained a low copy plasmid, exhibited relatively high EGFP expression levels with improved in vitro and in vivo stability, compared with strains containing high copy plasmids. This strain induced the highest levels of B cell immunogenicity (Table 4 and Figures 2B, 3 and 4) . This result is similar to those reported in previous studies, which have found that lowering the plasmid copy number results in enhanced plasmid stability and a reduction in the expression levels of heterologous antigens to non-toxic levels [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Problems associated with plasmid instability and toxicity due to high-level antigen expression may be circumvented through the use of a chromosome-based expression strategy. In this and other studies, homologous recombination has been used to insert a heterologous antigen expression cassette into the Salmonella chromosome, resulting in the creation of recombinant strains with good in vitro and in vivo stabilities (Table 4 and Figure 3 ) [35, 36] . However, as the heterologous gene is present as a single copy per bacterium, the expression levels may be too low to effectively induce a B cell response. In this study, the poor B cell responses against the chromosome-based expression strains CP and CO were probably due to the low levels of EGFP expression ( Figures 2B and 4A ). Similar findings have been previously reported. For example, during efforts to develop a live Salmonella oral vaccine against fragment C of the tetanus toxin (TetC), the recombination of TetC into the aroC gene of S. typhimurium created a strain with good stability; however low TetC expression levels resulted in poor immunogenicity. One possible way to increase expression levels would be to insert multiple copies of the heterologous antigen genes into chromosome.

Salmonella has been used as a delivery vector for eukaryotic plasmids for more than ten years [37] [38] [39] [40] . In these DNA vaccines, the plasmid encoding the target antigen gene is placed under the control of a eukaryotic promoter. Theoretically, Salmonella delivered-mucosal DNA vaccines can invade the Peyer's patches via M cells in the intestinal mucosa, which contain many antigenpresenting cells (APCs); such as macrophages and dendritic cells [41] . Once phagocytized by the APCs, the recombinant Salmonella cells would be lysed within the phagosomes, releasing the eukaryotic plasmids into the APCs. The APCs would then express the plasmidencoded antigen and present them to CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in the Peyer's patches or mesenteric lymph nodes via MHC I and MHC II molecules. In addition, the APCs may directly secrete the recombinant antigens from the cells, so that B cells can recognize them via B cell receptors (BCRs). This process induces further mucosal, humoral or cellular immune responses against the heterologous antigen [38, [42] [43] [44] [45] . Many studies have found that Salmonella delivered DNA vaccines were particularly good at generating T cell responses against foreign antigens. In this project, we constructed a Salmonella-DNA vaccine strain (strain E) which contains a high copy eukaryotic plasmid (pEGFP). Using Western blotting, we confirmed that pEGFP plasmid delivered by the E strain could be used to successfully express EGFP in mice intestinal mucosal sites on day 1 after inoculation ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, we found that this Salmonella-eukaryotic plasmid-based system could induce better T cell responses than the Salmonella-highcopy-prokaryotic plasmid-based systems ( Figure 4C) ; However, its antibody responses were quite low ( Figure 4A ). Analogous findings have previously been reported. In one comparative study, it was shown that an oral Salmonella DNA vaccine strain encoding βgalactosidase induced better T helper cell and CTL responses than oral immunization with a Salmonella strain containing a prokaryotic plasmid-encoded β-galactosidase gene [38] . Similarly, oral immunization with the surface protein from the hepatitis B virus delivered by a Salmonella DNA vaccine elicited good T cell responses, but its B cell responses were quite low [46] . Based on our and others' comparative analyses, we consider it likely that the endogenously produced antigen delivered by the Salmonella-DNA vaccine may generate immune responses mainly through the MHC I pathway, thus resulting in higher T cell responses but lower B cell responses.

ELISpot results suggested that a chromosome-based expression system (CP strain) could also generate better T cell responses than strains containing high copy prokaryotic plasmids. Furthermore, results from the in vivo survival, infection ability and construct stability assays (Figure 3) , indicated that the CP strain had better survival abilities and construct stability than strains containing high copy plasmids. These findings indicated that colonization with recombinant vaccine strains with good construct stability is also an important factor for eliciting strong T cell responses. This is most likely due to the following reasons: T cell responses against Salmonella infection can be effectively induced only after the recombinant cells have invaded and proliferated within the APCs [47] . However, after oral administration, the bacterial cells would be in a low-nutrient environment that lacked antibiotic selective pressure. They would also be subjected to acidic conditions within the GI tract (even if this was partially negated by sodium bicarbonate lavage) as well as attack by the host immune defenses. Consequently, non-integrating (episomal) plasmids would be lost fairly rapidly as observed in survival, infection ability and construct stability analyses (Figure 3) , thereby greatly reducing the abilities of the bacterium to synthesize antigen protein in vivo. Chromosome-based strains such as CP avoid this problem, albeit at the price of reduced antigen expression levels. Even though the chromosome-based CO strain showed in vivo stabilities equivalent to the CP strain, its T cell responses were lower. It is possible that the membrane-expressed EGFP significantly slowed the growth rate of the CO strain (Table 2) , resulting in poorer in vivo survival and proliferation abilities (colonization ability), compared to the CP strain ( Figure 3A) .

It is notable that for the various single-recombinant strains, the general trend observed for the T cell responses ran contrary to the trend observed for the humoral immunity responses (described above). In this regard, the properties of the LP strain are worth commenting on. Even though its induced T cell responses were not as high as those elicited by the E and CP strains, it could simultaneously induce both B cell and T cell responses. It also exhibited better in vivo stability than the strains containing high copy plasmids ( Figure 3) . Consequently, if the aim was to develop a vaccine strain capable of inducing both B cell and T cell responses, then the use of a low copy cytoplasmic expression system may be desirable.

Since the strains containing the high or low copy prokaryotic plasmids (HP, LP, HO) could induce better B cell responses, while strains containing the eukaryotic expression plasmid (E) or the chromosome-based expression cassette (CP) elicited higher anti-EGFP IFN-γ responses, we hypothesized that a combination of two individual expression strategies may result in both stronger B and T cell responses. Consequently, we created five double-recombinant strains (CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO, CP + E, E + LP). We used CP and E as the starting strains for the construction of these five dual-expression systems, using compatible plasmid replication origins and orthogonal antibiotic resistance genes. The CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and E + LP strains were designed to elicit both stronger B cell and T cell responses. The CP + E strain was constructed to investigate whether it could generate a T cell response that was higher than those of the two individual strains. Contrary to our initial expectations, both the humoral and T cell immune responses against these five double-recombinant strains were not markedly improved, some of them were obviously worse than their individual parent strains (Figure 4) . There are several possible reasons for this lack of synergy: first, the combination increased the frequency of plasmid loss. According to our in vitro plasmid stability studies (Table 5) , we found that the detection rates for pHP in the CP + HP strain, pHO in the CP + HO strain and pEGFP in the E + LP strain were 0.8%, 60.0% and 50.0%, respectively. This suggested that the high copy plasmids were more easily displaced in the double-recombinant strains, resulting in a decrease in EGFP expression levels ( Figure 2B) and B cell responses ( Figure 4A and B) . Second, antibiotic selection pressure was increased. To maintain the plasmids, we used relatively high concentrations of two antibiotics during the subculturing procedures. However, the high-copy plasmids, containing pUC replication origins, were still frequently lost from the cells. Upon losing the plasmid, the relevant antibiotic will become toxic to the cell, resulting in significantly decreased growth rates for the five double-recombinant strains (Tables 2 and 3 ). It would also cause an increase in 'stress' for the cell, resulting in defects in replication and other growth-related effects; which were manifested in the frequent formation of filamentous cells (Figure 2A ) [48] [49] [50] . Furthermore, even though the high-copy plasmids were not lost from some of the recombinant Salmonella strains in vitro; as was noted for the HO, E and CP + E strains (Tables 4 and 5) , cell elongation was still observed (Figure 2A ). This may be due to the 'metabolic burden' [51] [52] [53] caused by the active maintenance of multiple high copy plasmids within the cell, leading to decreases in its overall immunogenic properties.

As the expression abilities of Salmonella are relatively similar to those of Escherichia coli, this prokaryotic system may not be suitable for the expression of protein antigens from viruses or higher eukaryotes [38] . Consequently, when constructing a vaccine strain against a virus such as avian influenza H5N1, several factors must be taken into consideration. The first is codon bias; however this may be easily resolved by gene synthesis, using the codons preferred by Salmonella. The second problem is the inability to express soluble antigen within the cytoplasm, or to target it to the cell surface in a correctly folded form. Many antigens from eukaryotic viruses, such as the HA protein from H5N1, cannot be readily expressed in a soluble form within the cytoplasm of Salmonella [8] . This type of situation can dramatically decrease the B cell and T cell immune response within the infected host. According to our in vivo immune response assays, no detectable B cell or T cell responses could be detected when mice were immunized with the C-HAOP strain, which was designed to cytoplasmically express the HA antigen.

It has previously been reported that expressing the antigen protein on the outer membrane of the engineered bacterial cells may increase the immune response [54] , since this may increase the likelihood of recognition by the host immune system. To investigate this issue, we targeted the EGFP protein for outer membrane expression using the lpp-ompA outer membrane expression system. Analogous outer membrane expression cassettes were located on a high-copy plasmid (HO strain) and on the chromosome (CO strain). The B cell responses ( Figure 4A ) against these two strains were weaker than those obtained for the LP strain; and the T cell responses ( Figure 4C ) against the HO strain were lower than those obtained for the E and CP strains. This may be because the total amounts of EGFP synthesized and exported to the outer membrane were too low to induce an effective B cell response ( Figure 2B ), or because the in vivo stabilities of the high copy plasmids were not sufficient to induce an effective T cell response ( Figure 3 ). However, this strategy proved somewhat more successful for the HA antigen, which appears to be largely present in insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of Salmonella. We found that the use of the lpp-ompA system, which is present in the O-HAOP strain, resulted in the successful export of HA antigen to the outer membrane fraction ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, results from ELISA, HIA and ELISpot assays indicated this strain of Salmonella was capable of inducing better HA-specific B cell and T cell responses than the corresponding C-HAOP strain, which expresses the HA antigen in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5C , D and E). It is possible that the use of the Lpp-OmpA system either helps the HA protein fold into a soluble conformation, or results in the export of increased amounts of HA protein, causing notable enhancements in immunogenicity.

In this study, we used EGFP and HAOP as model antigens to systematically compare the immunogenic potency of various recombinant Salmonella strains as live, oral antigen-delivery vectors. Our results indicate that if the antigen (such as EGFP) is soluble and easily expressed in Salmonella, a low-copy plasmid-based strategy should be employed, as it can provoke better B cell responses and can also induce T cell responses. If a T cell response is preferred, a eukaryotic plasmid, or chromosome-based expression strategy may achieve better results. For heterologous antigens that are likely to be expressed in an insoluble form within Salmonella (such as HA), an outer membrane-targeting approach is recommended. In addition, we found that the combination of two expression strategies did not enhance the immune response, and hence we caution against the use of such an approach.

All animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines). 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice purchased from the Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong were used for this study. This study was approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR) of The University of Hong Kong, with the CULATR Number 2051-09.

Escherichia coli strain DH10B (Invitrogen) was used for all plasmid construction experiments. Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium aroAstrain SL7207 was kindly provided by Dr. B.A.D. Stocker [55] . All bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37°C. Minimal medium for target protein induction was based on the N-salts recipe [56] . Antibiotics (Sigma) for clone selection were used at the following final concentrations: ampicillin (Amp, 200 μg/ml), kanamycin (Km, 50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (Cm, 25 μg/ml). Restriction endonucleases and ligase enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (NEB). Taq polymerase (Pyrobest and Ex-taq) and the pMD18-T vector were from Takara. Plasmid pSim6 was a gift from Dr. D.L. Court. Plasmid pBluescript II SK (pBSK) was bought from Stratagene. Other plasmids were from lab stocks.

The compositions of six 'single-recombinant' Salmonella-EGFP strains (i.e. strains containing a single episomal or chromosomal copy of the EGFP gene) are listed in Table 1 . The primers used to construct the six 'singlerecombinant' Salmonella-EGFP strains are listed in Table 6 . The prosseA promoter was PCR amplified from pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) of SL7207 using the NotI-prosseA-F and HindIII-prosseA-R primers; the EGFP gene was PCR amplified from ploxp-cm-loxp with the HindIII-EGFP-F and XhoI-Ter-EGFP-R primers; then these prosseA and EGFP fragments were co-ligated into vector pBSK via NotI and XhoI to create pHP.

The p15A origin was amplified from plasmid pACYC177 using primers p15A-F and p15A-R, and an EGFP expression cassette was amplified from pHP using primers NotI-prosseA-F and XhoI-Ter-EGFP-R. Both fragments were directly ligated together to creat pLP.

The lpp-OmpA outer membrane expression cassette was amplified from SL7207 using primers ompA-F and ompA-R, and was ligated into the pMD18-T vector to create plasmid pOmpA. pHO was constructed by ligating an EGFP cassette (amplified from ploxp-cm-loxp using primers oEGFP-F and oEGFP-R) downstream of lpp-OmpA in pOmpA via NotI and XhoI. Strains HP, LP, HO and E were generated by transforming plasmids pHP, pLP, pHO and pEGFP, respectively into SL7207 by electroporation.

A loxp-Cm-loxp cassette was PCR amplified from plasmid ploxp-Cm-loxp using primers XhoI-floxed-F and XhoI-floxed-R [57] , digested with XhoI, then ligated into the XhoI site of plasmid pHP to create plasmid pCP-cm. pCO-cm was generated by replacing the EGFP gene in pHP with NdeI-lpp-OmpA-EGFP-XhoI and XhoI-loxp-Cm-loxp-XhoI fragments. The linear dsDNA fragments used to create the CP and CO chromosomebased expression strains were respectively amplified from pCP-cm and pCO-cm by PCR using a same pair of primers (htrA-F and htrA-R). Red recombineering was used to construct the CP and CO strains, via transient expression of λ-Red genes from pSim6 in SL7207 according to the method of Yu et al. [22, 58] . Transformants were selected by plating onto LB agar plates containing the required antibiotics, incubating at 37°C overnight.

The compositions of the five 'double-recombinant' Salmonella-EGFP strains (i.e. strains containing two individual copies of the EGFP gene) are described in Table 1 .

Strains CP + HP, CP + LP, CP + HO and CP + E were generated by respectively electro-transforming plasmids pHP, pLP, pHO or pEGFP into the CP strain. The LP + E strain was generated by electro-transforming pEGFP into the LP strain. Successful transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics, incubating at 37°C overnight.

The sequence of the HA epitope (residues 91-261) from the H5N1 virus (H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/2004) was codon-optimized for translation in Salmonella based on sequence data from the NCBI-GenBank, and synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, USA). This synthetic codonoptimized HA epitope gene (denoted HAOP) was cloned between the NotI and XhoI sites of pHP (thereby replacing the EGFP gene) to create pHAOP. pO-HAOP was analogously generated by replacing the EGFP gene of pHO with a NotI/XhoI-digested HAOP fragment. Plasmids pHAOP and pO-HAOP were respectively electrotransformed into SL7207 to generate a cytoplasmicexpression HAOP Salmonella strain (denoted C-HAOP) and a membrane-expression HAOP Salmonella strain (denoted O-HAOP).

In order to minimize plasmid loss, the recombinant Salmonella strains were freshly streaked from −80°C stocks onto LB agar plates containing the required antibiotics (Table 1 ) and incubated at 37°C overnight. Single colonies were inoculated into 30 ml liquid LB medium with antibiotics and cultured at 37°C with shaking for 10 hours. The 10-hour bacterial cultures were expanded (1:10) into fresh LB medium containing antibiotics, With the exception of the CP and CO strains, cells were then collected by centrifugation (4,000 g, 4°C); washed once with PBS; resuspended in PBS equal to the volume of the original culture; then immediately used for immunization or expression analysis. Further induction was required for the CP and CO strains, using equal volumes of N-salts medium. Prior to induction, freshlycultured CP or CO strains were collected by centrifugation (4,000 g, 4°C), then washed twice with N-salts medium in equal volume of bacteria cultures. Cells were then resuspended in N-salts medium containing the appropriate antibiotics (equal to the original volume of the bacterial culture), and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours to induce protein expression. After 24 hours, cells were collected for expression analysis or immunization as above.

Fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51 microscope) was used to analyze EGFP expression within the eleven recombinant Salmonella strains. Freshly-cultured bacterial cells (10 μl) were immobilized on 1% agarose pads on glass slides, then visualized using a 60x oil-immersion objective lens. Both bright-field and fluorescent field (ex. 488 nm, em. 518 nm) images were captured (Spot RT3 Digital Camera, Spot Advanced Software Version 4.6). Freshly cultured SL7207 cells were used as a negative control.

A fluorescence micro-plate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify EGFP expression levels within freshly-cultured recombinant Salmonella strains. 1 × 10 8 cells were resuspended in 100 μl PBS in 96-well plates (IWAKI, 96 well microplate with flat bottom), and EGFP fluorescence intensity was immediately recorded at room temperature (ex. 518 nm, em. 518 nm; time resolution: 500 ms). Measurements were performed in triplicate, and SL7207 was used as a negative control.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by Western blot analysis was performed to detect EGFP expression in the CO strain. The in vitro and in vivo EGFP expression levels in E, HAOP, C-HAOP and O-HAOP strains; were determined using slightly-modified protocols for each strain. CO strain: cells from 4 ml of induced bacterial culture were collected and resuspended in 100 μl PBS + 50 μl of loading buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2%SDS, 14.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and boiled (10 minutes) to prepare lysates for analysis. GFP rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen), were used as the as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. SL7207 cells were also treated as above as the negative control.

E strain: in vitro and in vivo EGFP expression was quantified by Western blot. The EGFP expression in the eukaryotic cells was first detected in vitro by infecting the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line (American Type Culture Collection) with the E strain. The Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line was cultured using Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen) in 24-well plate (TPP, USA) with 5 × 10 5 cells per well at 37°C in 5% CO2. After cell confluence reached 90%, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS twice. Then PBS-washed 1 × 10 7 CFU bacterial cells of E strain in DMEM-20% FBS in the absence of antibiotics were used to incubate with the Caco-2 cells. After 2.5 hours incubation, the non-adherent bacteria were removed by washing with PBS three times. DMEM with 20% FBS was added to maintain the cells at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Cell samples were collected 12, 20 and 30 hours after infection, respectively. Caco-2 cell protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% Deoxycholate, 1% NP40) plus protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS twice (2500 x g, 5 min), then RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor was added to mix the cell pellet completely, and this was incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes. The RIPA/cell mixture was centrifuged (13000 x g, 1 min) and the supernatant was collected for Western blot assay. The protein quantities were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). Equal amounts of protein from the samples were loaded to detect EGFP expression by Western blot using a GFP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a goat antimouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). GAPDH detection was also performed using an HRP conjugated antibody (Abnova). The SL7207 strain was also treated as above as the negative control.

EGFP expression delivered by the E strain was also investigated in the mouse intestine. 1 × 10 11 of bacterial cells of the E strain or the SL7207 strain re-suspended in 200 μl PBS, were orally administrated to 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice after neutralizing the gastric acid (gavage with 100 μl of 3% sodium bicarbonate), respectively. Intestinal mucosa samples from two groups of mice were collected using heated glass slides on day 1, 3 and 7 after inoculation. Total proteins of intestinal mucosa were extracted using RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitor as mentioned before. Equal amounts of protein samples quantified by BCA protein assay were used to perform Western blot, to detect EGFP expression using the same protocol mentioned above. GAPDH was also detected as the internal control.

C-HAOP strain: total cell lysate (from 1 × 10 9 bacterial cells) was prepared as described above. For the cellfraction lysates, 1 × 10 9 cells were resuspended in 100 μl PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Complete EDTA-Free), then sonicated (Sonics, model VCX750; with ice cooling). After centrifugation (12,000 x g; 1 min; 4°C), the supernatant (ca. 90 μl) was decanted and 50 μl of (x3) loading buffer added. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of (x1) loading buffer. Samples were similarly boiled (10 mins), prior to Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal influenza A virus hemagglutinin antibody (ab36565, Abcam) and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. SL7207 cells were treated as above as negative control.

O-HAOP strain: 40 ml of freshly-cultured bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,500 x g, 15 mins, 4°C), resuspended in 10 ml PBS containing protease inhibitors, then sonicated 4°C). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (3,500 x g, 10 mins, 4°C), then the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged (100,000 x g, 60 mins, 4°C) to collect the total membrane fraction (as the pellet). A portion of the membrane fraction was resuspended in PBS containing 0.01 mM MgCl2 and 2% Triton X100, and then centrifuged (100,000 x g, 60 mins, 4°C). The inner membrane fraction was collected as the supernatant; whilst the pellet, which contains the outer membrane fraction, was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. The protein concentration of each fraction was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher). Each fraction was boiled with loading buffer (as above) and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal influenza A virus hemagglutinin antibody and HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The membrane fraction from the HO strain was used as a negative control.

Microscopic images of SL7207 and the various recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains were captured using light microscopy (Olympus BX51 microscope). Twenty cells from each recombinant strain, as well as the SL7207 control were randomly selected from the microscopic images for cell length analysis using the Image J software program [58] . The mean cell length for each strain was reported ± standard deviation and then compared to the SL7207 control.

In vitro growth of recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains and stability of EGFP expression constructs under antibiotic pressure

To assess the growth of the six single-recombinant and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains in vitro, the doubling times of these eleven recombinant strains were measured in liquid LB broth with antibiotics. Apart from using SL7207 as a general negative control, the empty vectors: pBSK, pACYC177, pOmpA, pVAX-1 were electro-transformed into SL7207 to create strains: BSK, ACYC177, OmpA and VAX-1 as the negative controls of HP, LP, HO, E strains, respectively. The VAX-1 + ACYC177 strain was generated by co-electrotransforming pACYC177 and pVAX-1 into SL7207, as a negative control for the E + LP strain. 10hour bacterial cultures from each strain obtained using the protocol described in Part 3 were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB medium containing antibiotics. The diluted cultures were then incubated at 37°C with shaking. Bacterial growth was measured spectrophotometrically using OD 600 , at intervals of 30 mins. Four replicates were performed for each strain, and the mean is reported ± standard deviation.

The stability of the six single-recombinant and five double-recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains under antibiotic selective pressure, prior to oral administration were measured via colony forming unit (CFU) assay. 1 × 10 9 cells from each strain were collected and resuspended in 1 ml fresh LB. Six 1:10 serial dilutions were performed, and 10 μl of each dilution was spread on LB agar plates, or LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics as listed in Table 1 . Colonies were counted after incubation overnight at 37°C. Three replicates were performed for each dilution, and the mean is reported ± standard deviation.

In order to determine the survival and infection abilities of the six single-recombinant Salmonella EGFP strains, and the in vivo stabilities of the six EGFP expression constructs, 1 × 10 11 of freshly cultured bacterial cells from each of the six strains resuspended in 200 μl PBS, were separately orally administrated to 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice after neutralizing the gastric acid. 6 mice were grouped for each of the six strains, and one group of mice immunized with SL7207 was kept identically as the negative control. Fecal, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes samples were collected from each group on days 1, 3 and 7 after administration for CFU assays, respectively. All the samples were homogenized and re-suspended in 9 × LB broth according to sample weights. Then seven 1:10 serial dilutions were carried out in a final volume 100 μl. 10 μl of each dilution was spread on LB agar plates, or LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics as listed in Table 1 . Enumeration was performed after incubation overnight at 37°C. Three replicates were performed for each dilution, and the mean is reported ± standard deviation.

In vivo immune response assays Animal immunization 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice purchased from the Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong (CULATR 2051-09) were used for all in vivo immune response tests. Identical batches of 1 × 10 11 of PBSwashed, freshly-cultured bacterial cells resuspended in 200 μl PBS were used for each immunization procedure (prime and boost) for each strain. Immediately prior to oral administration, each mouse was orally gavaged with 100 μl of 3% sodium bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acid. Cells were administered by oral gavage; giving two boosts on day 21 and day 35 after the initial prime. Groups of 5-10 mice were used for each of the 11 recombinant Salmonella-EGFP strains, and one group of non-infected mice were kept identically as the negative control. In analogous parallel experiments, three further groups of 5-10 mice were orally immunized with the C-HAOP, O-HAOP or HO (as control) strains; with an additional group of non-infected mice kept as a negative control.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to detect antigen-specific IgG response using mice serum on day 7, 28 and 42. ELISA plates (Ni-NTA His-Sorb TM plate, QIAgen) were pre-coated with 100 ng GFP (Millipore) or H5 antigen (H5N1, A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004, Immune Technology Corp.) in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.2% BSA, at 4°C overnight. The pre-coating solution was removed, then unreacted sites were blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA, incubating for 2 hours at room temperature. After removal of blocking buffer, serial dilutions of mice serum in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.2% BSA were added, then plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Unbound serum antibodies were washed-off with PBST (6 washes). Goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen, 20,000-fold dilution in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.2% BSA) was added and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After 6 washes with PBST, 200 μl of TMB solution (Calbiochem) was added, and plates were incubated at room temperature until the appearance of a blue color. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 M sulphuric acid, then intensities were determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 340, GrandTech Scientific).

Hemagglutination inhibition assays (HIA) were performed according to a standard protocol with minor modifications [59] . Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions of O-HAOP vaccinated mice serum (ranging from 1:8 to 1:256, in PBS; final volume of 25 μl;) were added to wells of a microtiter plate, together with 25 μl of H5N1 virus suspension (H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Microplates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. 50 μl of chicken red blood cell suspension was added to each well, and plates were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking until the chicken red blood cell control (chicken red blood cell in 50 μl PBS) formed a button at the bottom of a well. The HIA titer for each serum sample was defined as the highest dilution of serum that could completely inhibit hemagglutination. Sera from non-infected mice, as well as those inoculated with the HO strain were used as negative controls. Three replicates were performed for each dilution.

ELISpot assays were used to detect the antigen-specific mouse IFN-γ response as described in the Mabtech manual of ELISpot kit. The ELISpot plate (Mabtech) was first activated by adding 50 μl of 70% ethanol to each well for 2 minutes, followed by washing 5 times with 200 μl sterile water. Wells were then pre-coated with 100 μl of 15 μg/ml anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody (AN18 Mabtech) diluted in sterile PBS, incubating at 4°C overnight. Excess antibody was then removed by washing 5 times with 200 μl sterile water. Plates were incubated with 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 30 minutes. During incubation, spleens taken from day 42 mice were homogenized and treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (10 mM KHCO 3 , 150 mM NH 4 Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA). The spleen cell homogenates were filtered (40 μm cell strainer, BD Falcon) then centrifuged (1000 x g, 8 minutes, 4°C). Cell pellets were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. 2 × 10 5 cells in 100 μl RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS were added to each pre-coated well. For each mice, 200 ng of H5 or GFP antigen and 100 antimouse CD28 (BD Pharmingen) were added to triplicate wells as sample stimulatory agents; 2 ng phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), 100 ng Ionomycin calcium salt (INO, Sigma) and 100 ng anti-mouse CD28 were added into triplicate wells as the stimulatory agents of positive control; Meanwhile, another triplicate wells was added no stimulatory agents as negative control. Plates were then incubated at 37°C for 44 hours. Wells were then washed 5 times with 200 μl PBS, and incubated with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml detection antibody (R4-6A2-biotin, Mabtech) in PBS-0.5% FBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Unbound antibody was removed by washing 5 times with 200 μl PBS, then plates were incubated with 100 μl of 1000-fold diluted Streptavidin-HRP in PBS + 0.5% FBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing 5 times with 200 μl PBS, 100 μl of TMB solution was added, and plates were allowed to develop at room temperature until distinct spots emerged. Colour development was stopped by washing extensively with water. After allowing spots to dry at room temperature in a fume hood, plates were analyzed using an ELISpot reader (C.T.L. Analyzers, LLC).

Differences between the means of two experimental groups were analyzed by the Student's t-test. One-Way ANOVA (SPSS 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was performed to compare the differences of multiple groups. Results are presented as mean values ± standard error, and at least three independent replicates were performed for each condition.
