16, The surveillance of zoonotic viruses in wildlife populations is necessary in order to monitor the risk of emerging infectious disease outbreaks,0.890679922517905,xMAP Technology: Applications in Detection of Pathogens
8," This disease coverage is important as many infectious diseases of public health concern are zoonotic, naturally circulating among wildlife reservoir hosts before emerging in the human population",0.8857405319192979,JAMIA Focus on Media-based Biosurveillance Model Formulation Ⅲ HealthMap: Global Infectious Disease Monitoring through Automated Classification and Visualization of Internet Media Reports
43," By targeting this and other potential routes of food contamination, surveillance efforts and control measures may better minimize the risk of zoonotic disease emergence",0.8719791483993802,Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control
21,"As the number of zoonotic diseases rises, the identification of pathogens in marine mammals has become an indicator of environmental health",0.8702856780631818,New Technologies for Monitoring Marine Mammal Health
41, Data from animal and environmental health sources can help to identify emerging infectious disease risks,0.867520464691582,Communicable Disease Surveillance Ethics in the Age of Big Data and New Technology
8,"Accordingly, while HealthMap focuses primarily on human disease surveillance, one of our design objectives is comprehensive coverage of disease activity, encompassing animal and plant diseases, as well as some insect pests and other invasive species",0.8654124792731109,JAMIA Focus on Media-based Biosurveillance Model Formulation Ⅲ HealthMap: Global Infectious Disease Monitoring through Automated Classification and Visualization of Internet Media Reports
43," Proactive approaches include pathogen discovery in wildlife to identify potential zoonoses , Lipkin 2013 , however the number of microbes in wildlife remaining to be discovered is likely large and the causes and dynamics of transmission from wildlife to human are poorly understood ( Jones et al",0.8600235663521527,Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control
21," Therefore, the identification of pathogens in marine mammals may also moderate disease outbreaks and prevent zoonotic transmission (Delwart, 2012) ",0.8563775336432626,New Technologies for Monitoring Marine Mammal Health
21, Marine sentinels allow the characterization and management of potentially negative impacts linked to the environment degradation that can affect animal and human health associated with the oceans,0.8561946102588822,New Technologies for Monitoring Marine Mammal Health
43," However, it is likely that many more novel transmission pathways remain undescribed for pathogens that pose a potential human health risk",0.854322943312337,Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control
