xMAP Technology: Applications in Detection of Pathogens," For detection of gastrointestinal pathogens xTAG R Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel -GPP is commercially available [multiplex detection of various viral, bacterial and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool samples (Beckmann et al
 Majority of xMAP applications for the multiplex detection and identification of fungal pathogens are based on the capture of fungal nucleic acid by DDH assays","Reslova, Nikol; Michna, Veronika; Kasny, Martin; Mikel, Pavel; Kralik, Petr",2017-01-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263158/
Future Veterinary Diagnostics," Protein microarray technology has enormous potential for in vitro diagnostics and disease monitoring
 1 Classical pathogen detection and identification are based on culture methodology, biochemical tests, and microscopy","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
Diagnostic System for Rapid and Sensitive Differential Detection of Pathogens," We describe a diagnostic system for rapid, sensitive, multiplex discrimination of microbial gene sequences and report its application for detecting 22 respiratory pathogens in clinical samples
 Methods to directly detect nucleic acids of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens are rapid, sensitive, and may succeed when culturing the organism fails","Briese, Thomas; Palacios, Gustavo; Kokoris, Mark; Jabado, Omar; Liu, Zhiqiang; Renwick, Neil; Kapoor, Vishal; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Limberger, Ron; Perez-Brena, Pilar; Ju, Jingyue; Lipkin, W.
