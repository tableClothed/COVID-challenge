Internet-based surveillance systems for monitoring emerging infectious diseases," Attrition during disease pathogenesis or healthseeking pathways is both high and cumulative-results of a study done in rural Cambodia showed that 67% of cases of haemorrhagic fever were treated at home, rather than in a health facility; thus, a health-care-based surveillance system would miss 67% of information before it even becomes accessible","Milinovich, Gabriel J; Williams, Gail M; Clements, Archie C A; Hu, Wenbiao",2014-02-28,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(13)70244-5

"The individual, environmental, and organizational factors that influence nurses' use of facial protection to prevent occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illness in acute care hospitals"," 19 The Canadian Nurses Association profile indicates that the average age of this population was Health care workers' compliance with safe work behaviors to prevent the spread of infectious disease is historically poor
 Although this relationship may have some inherent contributory bias, it is important to note that nurses who report daily, weekly, or monthly use of facial protection should be the ones to care for patients with communicable respiratory disease or supervise those who are providing the care","Nichol, Kathryn; Bigelow, Philip; O'Brien-Pallas, Linda; McGeer, Allison; Manno, Mike; Holness, D.
