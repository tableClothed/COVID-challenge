Immunogenicity and Protection Efficacy of Subunit-based Smallpox Vaccines Using Variola Major Antigens," Immunogenicity and protection efficacy of polyvalent recombinant variola protein vaccines and polyvalent DNA vaccines expressing variola antigens
 Immunization with the polyvalent recombinant VARV protein vaccines was significantly more immunogenic than immunization with the polyvalent VARV DNA vaccines (p<0
) VACV challenge in Balb/C mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing variola antigens
 The protein vaccine was even more immunogenic than the live vaccinia vaccine in generating specific antibodies against three tested pox antigens","Sakhatskyy, Pavlo; Wang, Shixia; Zhang, Chuanyou; Chou, Te-Hui; Kishko, Michael; Lu, Shan",2008-02-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2254135?pdf=render
