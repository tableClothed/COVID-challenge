Tissue tropism and transmission ecology predict virulence of human RNA viruses," All virulence and risk factor data pertained to natural or unintentional artificially acquired human infection only, and data from intentional human infection, animal infection, and in vitro infection were not considered","Brierley, Liam; Pedersen, Amy B.; Woolhouse, Mark E. J.",2019-11-26,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6879112/
Nosocomial Transmission of Emerging Viruses via Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures," Some of these viruses may cause stuttering chains of transmission before disappearing from human populations, while others, like Ebola virus or pandemic influenza A virus, may cause large outbreaks before being contained or establish themselves as endemic pathogens in the human population [18] ","Judson, Seth D.; Munster, Vincent J.",2019-10-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832307/
Increased infection severity in downstream cities in infectious disease transmission and tourists surveillance analysis, Even the probability of tourists spreading infection or becoming infected decreases,"Zhang, Nan; Zhao, Pengcheng; Li, Yuguo",2019-06-07,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.03.004
The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission," 15 However, there is serological evidence of H5N1 infection among Alaskan hunters who handled dead wild avian species, 16 indicating that exposure to IAVs from wild birds through close contact can potentially cause infection","Joseph, Udayan; Su, Yvonne C. F.; Vijaykrishna, Dhanasekaran; Smith, Gavin J. D.",2016-08-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155642/
"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus","By reducing viral load and viral shedding, vaccination reduces the risk of infection in vaccinated dogs and reduces the infectiousness of a dog who becomes infected despite vaccination
 Transmission is inefficient because many potentially infectious contacts between infected and susceptible individuals fail to spread the infection","Dalziel, Benjamin D.; Huang, Kai; Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Dubovi, Edward J.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Ellner, Stephen P.; Holmes, Edward C.; Parrish, Colin R.",2014-10-23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207809/
Vaccination of influenza a virus decreases transmission rates in pigs," Once the initial infected pig transmitted the infection to a susceptible pig, the infection chain proceeded until all or nearly all animals were infected","Romagosa, Anna; Allerson, Matt; Gramer, Marie; Joo, Han Soo; Deen, John; Detmer, Susan; Torremorell, Montserrat",2011-12-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258204/
The Benefits of Transmission Dynamics Models in Understanding Emerging Infectious Diseases," With infectious diseases, the number of individuals infected at any point in time influences the chance that a susceptible individual will contact an infected person","Wendelboe, Aaron M.; Grafe, Carl; Carabin, Hélène",2010-09-30,https://doi.org/10.1097/maj.0b013e3181e937ca
Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza,Individuals that are infected with influenza are believed to become permanently immune against the specific virus strain,"Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2007.12.001
