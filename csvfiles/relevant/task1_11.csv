Effectively Communicating the Uncertainties Surrounding Ebola Virus Transmission, The potential of EBOV spread via aerosol routes drastically changes health care and public health interventions,"Kilianski, Andy; Evans, Nicholas G.",2015-10-29,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626028/
Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control, Public health efforts could develop control strategies that focus on behavioral change in high-risk populations to minimize exposure to potential reservoirs and target relevant transmission pathways (e,"Loh, Elizabeth H.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Olival, Kevin J.; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Johnson, Christine K.; Mazet, Jonna A. K.; Karesh, William; Daszak, Peter",2015-07-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4507309?pdf=render
Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease," These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization
 The modeled population can be structured according to the contributions of community, hospital, and unsafe burials to transmission as EVD transmission has been amplified in health care settings with ineffective infection control measures and during unsafe burials [23] 
Drake and colleague's elegant modeling approach describes EVD transmission according to infection generations by calculating probability distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community via nursing care or during unsafe burials and in health care settings via infections to health care workers and visitors","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2015-01-21,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301953/
Spatial and temporal analyses to investigate infectious disease transmission within healthcare settings,"With movement of patients between care structures, differentiation between infection control in primary and secondary care is becoming more difficult","Davis, G.S.; Sevdalis, N.; Drumright, L.N.",2014-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2014.01.010
Internal versus external determinants of Schistosoma japonicum transmission in irrigated agricultural villages, In order to influence rural development priorities for disease control purposes at least a semi-quantitative understanding of the effects of environmental modification on disease transmission is needed,"Spear, Robert C.",2012-02-07,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243390/
Vaccination of influenza a virus decreases transmission rates in pigs,Understanding transmission of influenza and the factors that affect transmission is crucial for designing effective control strategies,"Romagosa, Anna; Allerson, Matt; Gramer, Marie; Joo, Han Soo; Deen, John; Detmer, Susan; Torremorell, Montserrat",2011-12-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258204/
