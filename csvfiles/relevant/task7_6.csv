Platform technologies for modern vaccine manufacturing," Permanent and regular module display is afforded through genetic fusion, eliminating downstream processing yet insertion sites for modulesTarget epitope Target pathogen + Bacteria Parasite Virus-like particle Virus Liposome Fig","Charlton Hume, Hayley K.; Lua, Linda H.L.",2017-08-16,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.069
Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies to Diagnostic Virology,"Deep sequencing showed also variability of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome and allowed to demonstrate virulence genes
 Coreceptor usage can be screened using phenotypic coreceptor tropism assays, based on recombinant virus technology, or genotypic tests, based on sequencing of the V3 loop of HIV env gene [117] 
Several studies that employed 454 pyrosequencing for deep analysis of mutations in HIV protease and reverse transcriptase genes demonstrated the accuracy of this technique in detecting all drug-resistance mutations identified by population sequencing, and the ability to detect low-frequency mutations undetectable by population sequencing [100, 102, 103] 
 Deep sequencing was used to analyze lots of oral poliovirus vaccine and the detected neurovirulence mutations were identical to the mutation detected with the standard method based on PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage [132] ","Barzon, Luisa; Lavezzo, Enrico; Militello, Valentina; Toppo, Stefano; Pal√π, Giorgio",2011-11-14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3233444/
Future Veterinary Diagnostics," Microarray hybridization is a viable approach for detecting unsequenced or uncharacterized viruses and novel virus discovery
 DNA microarrays have been used for the detection of infectious and genetic disease, cancer diagnostics, and forensic and genetic identification purposes
Scientific advancements over the previous 2 decades have enabled the sensitive detection and characterization of bacterial and viral nucleic acids
 This assay-based testing can be extended to include the detection and characterization of genes or mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence
 Protein microarrays have been developed for the detection of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E reactivity and detection of specific auto antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
