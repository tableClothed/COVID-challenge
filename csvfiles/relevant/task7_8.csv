Future Veterinary Diagnostics," 82 Biosensors can detect these changes and can analyze molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and classification, monitor response to treatment, and detect recurrence of the disease
 20 Innovative strategies using biomarkers represent alternative strategies for reliable cancer testing and for detecting clinical markers predictive of cardiovascular and other diseases
In protein expression analysis, proteins or biomarkers from complex biological samples are identified and correlated with diagnostic patterns that are unique to specific cancer and disease conditions
 Protein microarrays have been developed for the detection of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E reactivity and detection of specific auto antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases
 20 Prostatespecific antigen is the most reliable tumor marker to detect prostate cancer in its early stages
 Protein microarray technology has enormous potential for in vitro diagnostics and disease monitoring
 Immunoassay panels have been developed for fertility, cardiac disease, tumors, cytokines and growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, thyroid function, and drug residues
 50 SNP technology has been diversely applied in areas such as analyzing forensics, measuring disease predisposition, evaluating germ line mutations in individuals and somatic mutations in neoplasias, diagnosing infectious and genetic disease, and diagnosing cancer
 76, 77 Clinical application of biomarkers in the future includes the detection of subclinical diseases, diagnosis of acute or chronic syndromes, risk determination, therapy selection, and monitoring of disease progression or response to treatment","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
