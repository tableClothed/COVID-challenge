xMAP Technology: Applications in Detection of Pathogens,"In addition to respiratory viral diseases the MBMNA was successfully applied also for detection of viral pathogens causing acute viral gastroenteritis
Ligation assays are also often used for multiplex detection of pathogenic bacteria
 For detection of gastrointestinal pathogens xTAG R Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel -GPP is commercially available [multiplex detection of various viral, bacterial and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool samples (Beckmann et al","Reslova, Nikol; Michna, Veronika; Kasny, Martin; Mikel, Pavel; Kralik, Petr",2017-01-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263158/
"Establishing benchmarks and metrics for disruptive technologies, inappropriate and obsolete tests in the clinical laboratory","Bacterial antigen detection tests should be considered obsolete
 Obsolete tests in the microbiology laboratory include bacterial antigen detection tests, Group B Streptococcus antigen (GBS) testing and HIV-1 Western blot","Kiechle, Frederick L.; Arcenas, Rodney C.; Rogers, Linda C.",2014-01-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.05.024
Future Veterinary Diagnostics," Protein microarrays have been developed for the detection of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E reactivity and detection of specific auto antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases
 Quantification also aids in the treatment of patients with chronic infectious disease and monitoring disease progression and resolution
Several tests are now available for canine patients to identify oncogenes and clonal lymphocyte populations
 These antigen microarrays have been used to identify seropositive individuals by using the presence of serum antibodies to detect exposure to a specific pathogen","Dahlhausen, Bob",2010-04-30,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2010.05.006
