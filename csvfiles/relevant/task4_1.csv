Antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections," Typical therapy involves respiratory precautions and medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), that inhibit the influenza protein neuraminidase involved in release of virus particles","Salazar, Georgina; Zhang, Ningyan; Fu, Tong-Ming; An, Zhiqiang",2017-07-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627241/
Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis, Tofacitinib therapy may blunt cytokine production and/or leukocyte infiltration without enhancement of CHIKV replication,"Miner, Jonathan J.; Cook, Lindsey E.; Hong, Jun P.; Smith, Amber M.; Richner, Justin M.; Shimak, Raeann M.; Young, Alissa R.; Monte, Kristen; Poddar, Subhajit; Crowe, James E.; Lenschow, Deborah J.; Diamond, Michael S.",2017-02-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5448557?pdf=render
Inhibitor-Based Therapeutics for Treatment of Viral Hepatitis," These include potent polymerase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, cccDNA inhibitors, nucleocapsid assembly inhibitors, inhibitors of viral gene expression and HBsAg release inhibitors","Dey, Debajit; Banerjee, Manidipa",2016-09-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075008/
Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity," A recent study showed that cation-complexed HIV-1 plasmid DNA vaccines applied topically to the murine pulmonary mucosa induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses models [175] 
 Hence combinations of multiple cytokines in a DNA vaccine formulation or sequential vaccination with cytokines may enhance vaccine efficacy","Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",2015-12-28,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4955855?pdf=render
Inhibition of SARS Coronavirus Infection In Vitro with Clinically Approved Antiviral Drugs," They are representative compounds from major antiviral pharmacologic classes that are currently commercially available: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors
 Antiretroviral (HIV) drugs include reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors","Tan, Emily L.C.; Ooi, Eng Eong; Lin, Chin-Yo; Tan, Hwee Cheng; Ling, Ai Ee; Lim, Bing; Stanton, Lawrence W.",2004-04-27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323075/
