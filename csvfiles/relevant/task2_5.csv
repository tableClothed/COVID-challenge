Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy," 56 More research on the pathogenesis CMV infection is needed to define immunological correlates of protection against CMV transmission during pregnancy to inform vaccine development
 Understanding the pathogenesis of infectious diseases during pregnancy should inform vaccine design and the implementation of appropriate immunization protocols that optimize protection of pregnant women, fetuses and neonates they breach the placental barrier during critical developmental periods during pregnancy
 6 Overall, vertical transmission of these viruses is relatively uncommon, but adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion and pre-term birth can still occur as an indirect consequence of maternal inflammation","Vermillion, Meghan S.; Klein, Sabra L.",2018-02-01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794984/
Postnatal Infections and Immunology Affecting Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity," 130 The fetal and neonatal periods are unique immune developmental stages in which adaptive responses are highly plastic and dependent on gestational age
 114 A number of additional studies, evaluating exome sequencing in extremes of disease, epigenomic regulation, transcriptome responses to exposures such as hyperoxia, and pathway analyses are ongoing to identify gene and gene regulatory susceptibility factors involved in pathogenesis of BPD
 Perinatal therapeutic and environmental exposures, most notably oxygen exposure and environmental tobacco smoke, have been reproducibly related to chronic respiratory morbidity, independent of mechanical ventilation and Pryhuber the diagnosis of BPD","Pryhuber, Gloria S.",2015-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clp.2015.08.002
Maternal Infection and Adverse Fetal and Neonatal Outcomes, Transmission rates to the fetus vary depending on whether the infection is primary or recurrent,"Goldenberg, Robert L.; Culhane, Jennifer F.; Johnson, Derek C.",2005-09-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clp.2005.04.006
