Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission, This suggests that external processes such as inter-cluster migration could play an important role in sustaining STH transmission,Robert J Hardwick; Marleen Werkman; James E Truscott; Roy M Anderson,2019-12-18,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.19013490
The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission," 7 Conversely, the virus must also maintain its stability in variable extracellular pH environments in its transmission between hosts","Joseph, Udayan; Su, Yvonne C. F.; Vijaykrishna, Dhanasekaran; Smith, Gavin J. D.",2016-08-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155642/
Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control,"An important challenge to developing effective prevention and control strategies for zoonotic EIDs is identifying the relevant transmission routes between reservoir hosts and humans
 Because pathogens with different transmission pathways may require very different prevention and control strategies, understanding the relative importance of each pathway for a given pathogen is essential","Loh, Elizabeth H.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Olival, Kevin J.; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Johnson, Christine K.; Mazet, Jonna A. K.; Karesh, William; Daszak, Peter",2015-07-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4507309?pdf=render
"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus"," Our study investigates heterogeneity in CIV transmission and prevalence to better understand the processes that determine how zoonotic pathogens spread following a host range shift, and how these processes affect the performance of control and eradication strategies","Dalziel, Benjamin D.; Huang, Kai; Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Dubovi, Edward J.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Ellner, Stephen P.; Holmes, Edward C.; Parrish, Colin R.",2014-10-23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207809/
Vaccination of influenza a virus decreases transmission rates in pigs,Understanding transmission of influenza and the factors that affect transmission is crucial for designing effective control strategies,"Romagosa, Anna; Allerson, Matt; Gramer, Marie; Joo, Han Soo; Deen, John; Detmer, Susan; Torremorell, Montserrat",2011-12-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258204/
The Benefits of Transmission Dynamics Models in Understanding Emerging Infectious Diseases," Thus, transmission dynamics models are designed to describe and explain how transmission occurs between contacts","Wendelboe, Aaron M.; Grafe, Carl; Carabin, Hélène",2010-09-30,https://doi.org/10.1097/maj.0b013e3181e937ca
Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza,One line of addressing heterogeneous patterns of transmission using the observed data is separating household transmission from community transmission,"Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2007.12.001
