Tissue tropism and transmission ecology predict virulence of human RNA viruses," Tissue tropism should be a key consideration for future comparative and evolutionary modelling efforts
 We propose that future predictive studies and preparedness initiatives with respect to emerging diseases should carefully consider potential for human virulence","Brierley, Liam; Pedersen, Amy B.; Woolhouse, Mark E. J.",2019-11-26,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6879112/
Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice," To assess the potential contribution of genetic diversification by antiviral host deaminases, we evaluated mutant spectra for evidence of mutational biases
 Phenotypic characterization of these mutations by reverse genetics is warranted to elucidate their fitness effects
 Fidelity variant viruses allow for manipulation of intrahost diversity and can be harnessed to study phenotypic effects of intrahost diversity","Riemersma, Kasen K.; Steiner, Cody; Singapuri, Anil; Coffey, Lark L.",2019-01-17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340026/
"Widespread Recombination, Reassortment, and Transmission of Unbalanced Compound Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections", These findings provide an opportunity to study basic mechanisms of virus evolution and fitness through the identification of genetic determinants underpinning their action,"Stenglein, Mark D.; Jacobson, Elliott R.; Chang, Li-Wen; Sanders, Chris; Hawkins, Michelle G.; Guzman, David S-M.; Drazenovich, Tracy; Dunker, Freeland; Kamaka, Elizabeth K.; Fisher, Debbie; Reavill, Drury R.; Meola, Linda F.; Levens, Gregory; DeRisi, Joseph L.",2015-05-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438980/
Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2,"Here we use a model-based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data
 In conclusion, our framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity","Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Bedford, Trevor; Faria, Nuno; Bielejec, Filip; Baele, Guy; Russell, Colin A.; Smith, Derek J.; Pybus, Oliver G.; Brockmann, Dirk; Suchard, Marc A.",2014-02-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930559/
Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Reassortant H5N1 Influenza Virus in Indonesia, We expect future development of analysis methods will help to shed more light on the interaction between viral migration and genetic diversity,"Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Hon, Chung-Chau; Pybus, Oliver G.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.; Wong, Raymond Tze-Yeung; Yip, Chi-Wai; Zeng, Fanya; Leung, Frederick Chi-Ching",2008-08-22,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515348/
