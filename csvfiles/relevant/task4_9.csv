Human Monoclonal Antibodies as Adjuvant Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection,"Despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine leading to sterilizing immunity, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for chronic liver disease in more than 250 million individuals, potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma","Cerino, Antonella; Mantovani, Stefania; Mele, Dalila; Oliviero, Barbara; Varchetta, Stefania; Mondelli, Mario U.",2019-09-25,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6773823/
Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation as a marker for assessing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in human plasma and influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy,"ADCC-mediated clearance of virally infectected cells and ADCC protection following vaccination or natural infection are potentially important immune mechanisms against influenza infection
 However, influenza-vaccinated Tc bovine IVIG therapy deserves additional evaluation as a potential therapeutic for critically ill H1N1-infected patients","Morrison, Brian J.; Roman, Jessica A.; Luke, Thomas C.; Nagabhushana, Nishith; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Williams, Maya; Sun, Peifang",2017-10-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.007
Therapy with CTLA4-Ig and an antiviral monoclonal antibody controls chikungunya virus arthritis," The near-complete effectiveness of combination therapy in our mouse model of acute CHIKV arthritis has implications for treatment of other viral infections in which both virus-and immune-mediated pathology result in morbidity and mortality (for example, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus)","Miner, Jonathan J.; Cook, Lindsey E.; Hong, Jun P.; Smith, Amber M.; Richner, Justin M.; Shimak, Raeann M.; Young, Alissa R.; Monte, Kristen; Poddar, Subhajit; Crowe, James E.; Lenschow, Deborah J.; Diamond, Michael S.",2017-02-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5448557?pdf=render
New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets,"These findings show that, in a dose dependent way, prophylactically administered CR6261 confers protection against lethal H5N1 challenge, prevents morbidity and viral dissemination and reduces pulmonary pathology","Friesen, Robert H. E.; Koudstaal, Wouter; Koldijk, Martin H.; Weverling, Gerrit Jan; Brakenhoff, Just P. J.; Lenting, Peter J.; Stittelaar, Koert J.; Osterhaus, Albert D. M. E.; Kompier, Ronald; Goudsmit, Jaap",2010-02-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2817000/
Preparation of recombinant vaccines," Other diseases like hepatitis B and gastroenteritis induced by rotavirus might also be markedly reduced using vaccination
 Mice vaccinated with an influenza virus vaccine with LTB showed higher systemic and mucosal antibody responses than mice receiving the vaccine alone [82] ","Soler, Eric; Houdebine, Louis-Marie",2007-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1387-2656(07)13004-0
