Pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist MHC-II alleles in human populations," The authors suggested that the breadth of epitope-binding repertoire shapes genetic susceptibility to Marek's disease virus in chickens and HIV disease progression in humans
 Immunization of the corresponding HLA transgenic mouse strains with a set of dengue virus-derived peptides revealed a positive relationship between epitope repertoire size and immunogenicity","Manczinger, Máté; Boross, Gábor; Kemény, Lajos; Müller, Viktor; Lenz, Tobias L.; Papp, Balázs; Pál, Csaba",2019-01-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372212/
Natural selection and infectious disease in human populations," tuberculosis strain, an accurate phenotype would include sequence data from the pathogen","Karlsson, Elinor K.; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P.; Sabeti, Pardis C.",2014-04-29,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4912034?pdf=render
Feature Selection Methods for Identifying Genetic Determinants of Host Species in RNA Viruses,We first analyse polymerase gene sequences of RNA viruses to identify the genetic signatures predicting host species,"Aguas, Ricardo; Ferguson, Neil M.",2013-10-10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794897/
Molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses,Avian coronavirus IBV creates genetic diversity through rapid replication and large population sizes coupled with a high mutation rate and recombination,"Jackwood, Mark W.; Hall, David; Handel, Andreas",2012-08-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.05.003
Evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus in Felidae: Implications for human health and wildlife ecology,"Molecular genetic tools are informative in evaluating emerging pathogens and provide essential information such as pathogen identification, association of particular or novel strains with disease outbreaks, mutational changes leading to increased or decreased pathogenesis, and geographic and/or evolutionary origins of the pathogen
 These are but a few of the growing number of studies using molecular genomic technologies in nonhuman animal species that will advance our ability to identify regulatory/virulence genes in pathogens as well as host genes that regulate transmission, incubation, latency, virulence, morbidity, mortality and the immune response","Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Johnson, Warren E.; O’Brien, Stephen J.",2008-05-01,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2774529?pdf=render
