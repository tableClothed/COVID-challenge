37, The delayed rise of the innate immune response to a respiratory virus is explained by the suppression of immunity by the viral antagonist in vivo,0.7576757165073531,Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses
37," Therefore, inhibiting inflammation for two days not only affects innate immunity but also delays the initiation of adaptive immunity",0.7480695027721952,Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses
37, Type I IFN primed cells are protected from viral antagonism allowing the innate immune response to proceed,0.742492572018125,Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses
1,The magnitude of adaptive immune responses does not explain differences in susceptibility to infection,0.7301833183694296,Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics
37, This observation points out that immune modulation by the pathogen not only targets local lung immunity but also the external intervention of pre-programmed leukocytes with advantageous antiviral machinery,0.7266660493815124,Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses
1," Genetic resistance to infection, viral transmission, route of infection and regulation by immune responses were all subject to investigation",0.7238422326800763,Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics
3," The immune response to IAV infection in swine is similar to that of the human antiviral responses, with experimental evidence showing similar activation and secretion of cytokines is triggered in response to infection with the same virus",0.7197016693453252,The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission
37,"In vivo, lung secreted cytokines and chemokines also promote systemic awareness to the virus infection",0.7101872938108044,Buying Time-The Immune System Determinants of the Incubation Period to Respiratory Viruses
1," Firstly, differences in resistance and susceptibility were observed within 2-3 days postinfection, too early for an adaptive immune response and indicative of innate factors including innate immune mechanisms",0.7084778343937261,Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics
38," Nucleotide misincorporation by RdRp during replication contributes to antigenic drift, which increases the probability of the virus evading host immunity against seasonal influenza viruses",0.7050473845603099,"Naturally occurring mutations in PB1 affect influenza A virus replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability"
