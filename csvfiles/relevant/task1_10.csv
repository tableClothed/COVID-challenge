"Naturally occurring mutations in PB1 affect influenza A virus replication fidelity, virulence, and adaptability"," Nucleotide misincorporation by RdRp during replication contributes to antigenic drift, which increases the probability of the virus evading host immunity against seasonal influenza viruses","Lin, Ruey-Wen; Chen, Guang-Wu; Sung, Hsiang-Hsuan; Lin, Ren-Jye; Yen, Li-Chen; Tseng, Yu-Ling; Chang, Yung-Kun; Lien, Shu-Pei; Shih, Shin-Ru; Liao, Ching-Len",2019-07-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668090/
The ecology and adaptive evolution of influenza A interspecies transmission," The immune response to IAV infection in swine is similar to that of the human antiviral responses, with experimental evidence showing similar activation and secretion of cytokines is triggered in response to infection with the same virus","Joseph, Udayan; Su, Yvonne C. F.; Vijaykrishna, Dhanasekaran; Smith, Gavin J. D.",2016-08-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155642/
Host genetics determine susceptibility to avian influenza infection and transmission dynamics,"The magnitude of adaptive immune responses does not explain differences in susceptibility to infection
 Genetic resistance to infection, viral transmission, route of infection and regulation by immune responses were all subject to investigation
 Firstly, differences in resistance and susceptibility were observed within 2-3 days postinfection, too early for an adaptive immune response and indicative of innate factors including innate immune mechanisms","Ruiz-Hernandez, Raul; Mwangi, William; Peroval, Marylene; Sadeyen, Jean-Remy; Ascough, Stephanie; Balkissoon, Devanand; Staines, Karen; Boyd, Amy; McCauley, John; Smith, Adrian; Butter, Colin",2016-06-09,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899695/
