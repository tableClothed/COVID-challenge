Resistance to synthetic blood penetration of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators and surgical N95 respirators," 8 For N95 FFRs, the primary tests are filtration efficiency and airflow resistance","Rengasamy, Samy; Sbarra, Deborah; Nwoko, Julian; Shaffer, Ronald",2015-11-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.06.014
Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review," Procedures that might promote the generation of droplets or aerosols (nonexhaustive list) included non-invasive ventilation (CPAP and BiPAP), endotracheal intubation, airway suctioning, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, bag-valve mask ventilation, chest physiotherapy, nebulizer therapies, aerosol humidification, bronchoscopy or other upper airway endoscopy, tracheotomy, and open thoracotomy","Tran, Khai; Cimon, Karen; Severn, Melissa; Pessoa-Silva, Carmem L.; Conly, John",2012-04-26,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3338532/
"Applications of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation disinfection in health care facilities: Effective adjunct, but not stand-alone technology"," Under experimental laboratory conditions with mechanical ventilation rates of up to 6 ACH, the rate at which microorganisms are killed or inactivated by UVGI systems appears to be additive with mechanical ventilation systems in well-mixed rooms
 Experimental research has indicated that mechanical ventilation of up to 6 ACH does not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of upper-room UVGI systems; studies are needed to examine whether mechanical ventilation 
 Thus, room airflow is governed primarily, but not solely, by mechanical ventilation
 High ventilation rates, in terms of high values of air changes/hour (ACH), control particles by removal through ventilation","Memarzadeh, Farhad; Olmsted, Russell N.; Bartley, Judene M.",2010-06-30,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2010.04.208
Evaluation of the rationale for concurrent use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators during aerosol-generating medical procedures," Hospital engineering controls (eg, negative pressure rooms, room ventilation systems with high efficiency particulate filters, ultraviolet radiation, etc 8 ) and the use of medications to suppress coughing and salivation during airway procedures 4,10,35,38,39 further limit the airborne spread of respiratory pathogens and would additionally decrease the PAPR wearer's potential inhalational exposure","Roberge, Raymond J.",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2007.04.284
