Development of Novel DNA-Encoded PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibodies as Lipid-Lowering Therapeutics, The results of human DMAb studies in wild-type mice demonstrate the importance of considering intraspecies differences in antibody evaluation and how this may impact translation to other models,"Khoshnejad, Makan; Patel, Ami; Wojtak, Krzysztof; Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Humeau, Laurent; Lyssenko, Nicholas N.; Rader, Daniel J.; Muthumani, Kar; Weiner, David B.",2019-01-02,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.10.016
Molecular mechanisms for enhanced DNA vaccine immunogenicity,"As in traditional vaccine research, small rodent laboratory animals are principally used for DNA vaccine research
 An increasing number of these advances from preclinical models have advanced into human clinical trials
 While vaccine success in small animal models does not guarantee translation to humans, such studies remain an important part of the vaccine development pipeline","Li, Lei; Petrovsky, Nikolai",2015-12-28,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4955855?pdf=render
