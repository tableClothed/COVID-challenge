Stability of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus on Fomite Materials at Different Temperatures," Virus recovery from surfaces of Styrofoam, nitrile gloves, aluminum foil, Tyvek ® coverall, metal, rubber, plastic, cardboard, and cloth showed no significant differences between the materials at RT, suggesting that storage temperature had a substantial influence on virus survival
 Materials used were Styrofoam, nitrile gloves, cardboard, aluminum foil, Tyvek ® coveralls, cloth, metal, rubber, and plastic
 Specifically, Styrofoam, metal, and plastic provided extensive PEDV stability
 The rate of loss in infectivity was uniform on Styrofoam, aluminum, plastic, and Tyvek ® coverall, whereas viral infectivity on metal, nitrile gloves, and rubber dropped rapidly after 5 days at 4 • C
Circular pieces (approximately 1 cm 2 ) of various fomite materials were cut to fit into individual wells of Costar ® 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Inc","Kim, Yonghyan; Krishna, Venkatramana D.; Torremorell, Montserrat; Goyal, Sagar M.; Cheeran, Maxim C.-J.",2018-02-13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876564/
HVAC filtration for controlling infectious airborne disease transmission in indoor environments: Predicting risk reductions and operational costs,"From a mass balance perspective, HVAC filtration and other removal mechanisms are treated similarly to outdoor air ventilation because they both can be used to reduce indoor concentrations of airborne infectious particles","Azimi, Parham; Stephens, Brent",2013-12-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.025
