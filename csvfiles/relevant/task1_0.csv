SEIR Transmission dynamics model of 2019 nCoV coronavirus with considering the weak infectious ability and changes in latency duration,"77 SARS epidemic [4] ã€‚In the absence of comprehensive treatments or vaccines, China has adopted the most effective isolation prevention and control measures to isolate patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV to control the spread of infection, but the number of 2019-nCoV infections has far exceeded that of SARS epidemics",Pengpeng Shi; Shengli Cao; Peihua Feng,2020-02-20,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023655
Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease, EVD contagiousness is most pronounced in the later and more severe stages of Ebola infection when infectious individuals are confined at home or health care settings and mostly exposed to caregivers (e,"Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2015-01-21,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301953/
"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus"," Vaccination reduces a dog's susceptibility to infection by decreasing the probability that a virus population initially transferred through infectious contact will enter a phase of exponential growth, prerequisite to significant viral shedding and clinical symptoms [50] ","Dalziel, Benjamin D.; Huang, Kai; Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Dubovi, Edward J.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Ellner, Stephen P.; Holmes, Edward C.; Parrish, Colin R.",2014-10-23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207809/
Seasonality and prevalence of respiratory pathogens detected by multiplex PCR at a tertiary care medical center,"Acute respiratory tract illnesses are the most common illness in all age groups and are an important cause of hospitalization and mortality, especially in the winter months","Litwin, Christine M.; Bosley, James G.",2013-07-24,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086932/
Quantifying the transmission potential of pandemic influenza," Besides, for many recurrent infectious diseases including seasonal influenza, estimating the background immunity p in the population is extremely difficult due to cross-immunity of antigenically-related influenza strains and vaccination campaigns","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",2008-03-31,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2007.12.001
