Resistance to synthetic blood penetration of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators and surgical N95 respirators,"Background: Surgical N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a respirator and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a surgical mask, are often used to protect from the inhalation of infectious aerosols and from splashes/sprays of body fluids in health care facilities. A shortage of respirators can be expected during a pandemic. The availability of surgical N95 FFRs can potentially be increased by incorporating FDA clearance requirements in the NIOSH respirator approval process. Methods: Fluid resistance of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs, and FDA-cleared surgical N95 FFRs and surgical masks was tested using the ASTM F1862 method at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities and compared with the results from a third-party independent laboratory. Blood penetration through different layers of filter media of masks were also analyzed visually. Results: Four N95 FFR models showed no test failures at both velocities. The penetration results obtained in the NIOSH laboratory were comparable to those from the third-party independent laboratory. The number of respirator samples failing the test increased with increasing test velocity.","Surgical mask (SM) or facemask refers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared surgical, laser, isolation, dental, and medical procedure masks with or without a face shield. A SM covers the user's nose and mouth and provides a physical barrier to splashes/sprays of large droplets of body fluids. 1 SMs are used by health care personnel during surgical and nonsurgical procedures to protect both the patient and the health care worker from splashes/sprays of blood or other body fluids. 2 FDA clears SMs based on manufacturer-submitted test data and proposed claims. 3 Manufacturers submit the test results for particle filtration efficiency, bacterial filtration efficiency, fluid resistance, differential pressure, and flammability for FDA clearance. 3 The use of respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), at least as protective as a N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 FFR), is recommended during care of patients with diseases such as tuberculosis and measles and during aerosol-generating procedures on patients with certain infectious diseases (eg, seasonal influenza, novel influenza A, and Ebola virus disease). [4] [5] [6] [7] NIOSH tests and certifies the performance of FFRs according to requirements outlined in the US Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 84. 8 For N95 FFRs, the primary tests are filtration efficiency and airflow resistance.

The need for N95 FFRs with SM capabilities (eg, fluid resistance and flammability) was initially addressed, starting in 1996, by the FDA with the introduction of surgical N95 respirators. These are NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs that have been cleared by the FDA for fluid resistance and flammability. The surgical N95 FFRs offer the protection of both an N95 FFR and a SM. Because of these properties, surgical N95 FFRs are preferably used by health care personnel when protection from either fluids or aerosols, or both, may be needed. Currently, FDA clears only a small percentage of the total number of NIOSH-certified N95 FFR models under the Surgical N95 Respirators category. The use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical environments increases during outbreaks involving a known or suspected respiratory pathogen. For example, a scarcity of respirators during the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 9 and influenza 10 has been reported.

One possible option to increase the availability of surgical N95 FFRs for protection against inhalational hazards would be to expand NIOSH certification of N95 FFR models to include additional protection for fluid resistance and flammability. To better assess this option, NIOSH published a request for information in the Federal Register (Docket CDC-2014-0005) on the desirability of incorporating additional requirements and tests in the 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval process to match the FDA clearance requirements for surgical N95 respirators. 11 NIOSH provided data in the docket showing that non-FDA cleared, NIOSH-approved respirators were routinely used in health care and that several models of these types of devices were included in the United States Strategic National Stockpile for use during public health emergencies such as a pandemic. NIOSH solicited data on the performance of non-FDA cleared, NIOSH-approved respirators for fluid resistance against splashes/sprays faced by health care workers. Comments to the docket 11 did not include data on the fluid resistance properties of non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs.

Manufacturers evaluate fluid resistance of SMs and surgical N95 FFRs according to the ASTM F1862 method. 12 This method is also being used to test the fluid resistance of respirators for research purposes. 13 The fluid resistance test is a qualitative method based on visual inspection. Resistance to synthetic blood penetration is tested at 3 different velocities; 450, 550, and 635 cm/sec, corresponding to the range of human blood pressures 80, 120, and 160 mm Hg, respectively. FDA clearance 3 of a surgical N95 FFR requires testing of 32 samples for each model. Of the 32 samples, >29 (>90.6%) must pass the ASTM F1862 fluid resistance test at any of the above 3 velocities. FDA clears surgical N95 FFRs at 3 levels of fluid resistance based on their performance at 3 different velocities. Fluid resistance at low, medium, and high levels refers to the device passing the test at 450, 550, and 635 cm/ sec velocities, respectively. The level of fluid resistance is directly related to the test velocity. 14 Some models may pass the testing only at 450 cm/sec, whereas others may also pass at 550 cm/sec or even at 635 cm/sec. The model that passes the test at the highest velocity would have higher level of resistance compared with other models that pass the test only at the lower velocities (450 and 550 cm/sec).

In this study, NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs commonly used in industrial workplaces were evaluated for fluid resistance. N95 FFRs from 6 manufacturers were tested for resistance to synthetic blood penetration using the ASTM F1862 standard method at NIOSH (Morgantown, WV) and the results were compared with those obtained from a third-party independent (TPI) laboratory (Nelson Laboratory, Salt Lake City, Utah). In parallel, resistance testing was done for 3 FDA-cleared surgical N95 FFR and 2 SM category devices. The pass/fail results of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 FFRs, and SMs at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities were evaluated. The consistency of the test method was assessed by comparing the results obtained from NIOSH laboratory with the results from the TPI laboratory. The results, limitations of the test method, and future needs are discussed.

Six N95 FFR models, 3 surgical N95 FFR models, and 2 SM models were selected for this study. Two surgical N95 models were chosen for their identical physical appearance with 2 non-FDA cleared N95 models, whereas others were selected randomly from leading manufacturers (based upon market share) and from those in the Strategic National Stockpile. The manufacturers and devices are: 

A synthetic blood penetration test apparatus (Blood Spurt Tester, model SDL, Atlas LLC, Rock Hill, SC), similar to the 1 described in the ASTM standard, 12 was used in our study. The test apparatus consists of a specimen-holding fixture, a targeting plate, a pressurized fluid reservoir, a pneumatically actuated valve with an interchangeable canula (18-gauge stainless steel with an internal diameter of 0.084 cm), and a valve controller. The canula size was suitable to test synthetic blood penetration at arterial blood pressures ranging from 80-120 mm Hg corresponding to 450-635 cm/sec velocities. The specimen holder and the supporting frame of the fixture were rigid to resist the impact of the bloodspraying process. The height of the specimen holder was 420 mm, corresponding to the height of the synthetic blood reservoir. A targeting plate with a 0.5-cm hole was placed 1 cm in front of the mask to ensure that the synthetic blood hit the target area of the mask. The actuated valve was attached to a stable metal stand to withstand any flex during activation by the pneumatic control. The valve was positioned according to the ASTM F1862 method so that the exit of the canula was 30.5 cm from the point of impact on the specimen mask.

The fluid reservoir was filled with approximately 1 L fresh synthetic blood (Johnson, Moen & Co Inc, Rochester, Minn) and a canula was installed on the front of the pneumatically controlled valve. The canula used in the method is a 1.27-cm (0.5-in) long 18gauge stainless needle with an internal diameter of 0.084 cm (0.033 in). The synthetic blood penetration test was performed only at velocities of 450 and 635 cm/sec, corresponding to blood pressures of 80 and 160 mm Hg, respectively. The reservoir pressure was adjusted to approximately 8 psi or 12 psi to achieve a velocity of 450 cm/sec or 635 cm/sec, respectively. The test apparatus was calibrated for each target velocity by delivering the synthetic blood for a 1-second difference in spurt duration. The weight of synthetic blood delivered for a 0.5 second and a 1.5 second spurt were collected in separate small beakers. The 2 weights of the samples were recorded and the difference between the 2 weights was calculated. According to ASTM F1862, the target difference in weight plus lower and upper limits for a velocity range should be within 2% of the target. The target difference in weights for the test at the target velocities of 450 and 635 cm/sec were 2.506 g and 3.537 g, respectively. In this study, the acceptable weight range was between 2.456 g and 2.556 g for the 450 cm/sec velocity and was between 3.466 g and 3.607 g for the 635 cm/sec velocity, which were within the specified ranges.

During testing, 2.0 mL (2.0 g) synthetic blood was directed to the test sample for durations of 0.825 seconds and 0.550 seconds corresponding to target velocities of 450 cm/sec and 635 cm/sec, respectively. After every 15 samples, a check was performed to ensure that the test apparatus was still delivering 2.0 g synthetic blood by collecting and weighing the output passing through the targeting hole. When the blood sample delivered showed a shift of >0.10 g, all prior data since the last calibration were discarded. The canula was also cleaned after testing 15 samples.

Before use, test samples were conditioned in an environmental chamber (Caron Environmental Chamber, model 6001-1, Marietta, Ohio) for 4-6 hours at a temperature of 21 C AE 5 C and 85% AE 5% relative humidity, to simulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the mask on a wearer. Each test sample was removed from the environmental chamber and was mounted on the testing apparatus, centered, and 2-mL synthetic blood was dispersed at the target velocity within a minute. The synthetic blood penetration through the sample was assessed visually. A control mask for each model for all category devices was used for comparison. A drop of the blood was placed on the inner side of the control mask and compared with the color on the inner side of the test sample.

The fluid resistance pass/fail data for each test velocity at the NIOSH laboratory and TPI laboratory were combined for statistical analysis. The data at the 2 different test velocities and the 2 laboratories were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test matched pairs using SPSS software (version 20, IBM-SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY). The synthetic blood penetration results obtained at the NIOSH laboratory were compared with the results obtained by the TPI laboratory ( Table 2) . The number of samples tested at each velocity at the NIOSH laboratory varied from 10-15 for each model, whereas, only 10 samples per model were tested at TPI laboratory. Despite the difference in the number of samples tested at the 2 laboratories, the penetration results obtained at NIOSH were comparable to those from the TPI laboratory. For example, the same 4 N95 FFR models (ie, B, C, E, and F) that showed no penetration at the NIOSH laboratory also had no penetration at TPI laboratory. Model A showed penetration for some samples at the 2 test velocities in both laboratories. Similarly, some samples of model D showed penetration at 635 cm/sec at both testing laboratories. No penetration was obtained for 1 surgical N95 FFR model (ie, H) at both 450 and 635 cm/sec in both testing laboratories. In the case of SMs, 1 model showed penetration at both velocities at the NIOSH laboratory, but, no penetration at TPI laboratory. The other model had penetration only at 635 cm/sec at the NIOSH laboratory, but at both velocities at the TPI laboratory. Overall, 11 of 22 test results were the same between the 2 laboratories. Although the NIOSH laboratory found more samples (ie, 7) with higher failure rates than the TPI laboratory (ie, 4), the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .327).

For FDA clearance, synthetic blood penetration for 32 samples of each device is evaluated using the ASTM F1862 standard test method to achieve an acceptable quality limit of 4% as defined in the American National Standards Institute/American Society of Quality Control 15 standard. An acceptable quality limit of 4% includes minor deviations from the standard, such as the acceptance of synthetic blood penetration for <3 samples (<9.4%). To pass the test, <3 samples can show penetration at 450 cm/sec (the lowest of the 3 test velocities) at a minimum. A device that passes the test only at 450 cm/sec indicates its lower fluid resistance level. A very high fluid resistant device passes the penetration test at all 3 velocities. Table 3 shows the blood penetration results for the total number of samples for all models tested in the study. The results for the NIOSH and TPI laboratory samples were combined, because only a limited number of samples were tested at each laboratory. Moreover, a similar trend in penetration was obtained between the 2 laboratories. Samples from 4 out of 6 models of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs showed no penetration. Of the other 2 N95 FFR models, model A had penetration for 2 of 24 samples at 450 cm/sec and 7 of 25 samples at 635 cm/sec, indicating that model A may pass the resistance test at 450 cm/sec, but not at 635 cm/sec. Model D showed penetration for several samples at the lower velocity at 1 of the laboratories (see Table 2 ), but not at the other. Because of the contradictory results obtained at the lowest velocity, whether model D will meet the fluid resistance requirement is uncertain. Three surgical N95 FFR models were tested in the study, of which only model H had no failures at either velocity. All samples of model G passed the test at 450 cm/sec, whereas model I had 1 sample that failed the test at 450 cm/sec. Two SM models were tested and only 1 of 20 samples of both models failed at the lowest velocity. For this initial study, we did not test the full recommended sample size of 32, so it is not possible to say with 100% certainty whether the N95 FFR models with <3 failures would meet the FDA clearance requirements or not. However, because four of the models had no failures even at the highest velocity for the first 20-25 samples, it would seem likely that they would pass if testing had continued to the recommended sample size. Surgical N95 FFR models H and I were specifically included in this study because they appear to be identical to 2 non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs models (ie, C and E). Models C and I are both flat-folding respirators from the same manufacturer and visually appear to be identical except for color (1 is orange and the other is white). Similarly, E and H are identical in appearance, except for the labeling and packaging. As shown in Table 3 , both pairs exhibited similar fluid resistance properties.

Overall, the results showed an increase in synthetic blood penetration with increasing test velocity (Fig 1) , similar to other studies. 16 For comparison between the 2 velocities, the pass/fail data obtained in the 2 test laboratories were combined.

The number of samples of the 3 categories of masks that showed penetration increased with increasing velocity from 450-635 cm/sec. N95 FFR, surgical N95, and SM masks showed penetration for 7, 1, and 2 samples at 450 cm/sec, which increased to 16, 4, and 8 samples at 635 cm/sec. The percentage of samples that showed penetration was significantly (P ¼ .043) higher at 635 cm/sec than at 450 cm/sec. Penetration for large numbers of samples at higher velocity can be expected because an increase in the test velocity is likely to increase the permeability of the masks for fluids, including synthetic blood. Other factors include the configuration of the different types of filter media used in the multilayer construction of the mask. In general, the hydrophobic filter media-containing models are less likely to show penetration because of their ability to retard the penetration of a hydrophilic challenging test agent. The presence of a hydrophobic filter media on the outer surface may provide a barrier to the entry of hydrophilic water-based synthetic blood. 17 The lack of penetration of the devices may be maintained when the outer surface is hydrophobic and dry. Penetration can be expected when the outer layer is wet.

To gain more information on synthetic blood resistance of the mask, penetration through the different layers of the masks were analyzed visually. All of the models block the initial spray, but differences were found in how the synthetic blood moved through the layers of the device. Figure 2 shows the blood penetration through different layers of respirator models. A representative N95 FFR sample of model C, 1 of the 4 N95 models that passed the resistance testing, was analyzed for blood penetration through the different layers. Blood color was seen on the outer and inner sides of the outer layer (model C, 1a and 1b, respectively) and middle layer (model C, 2c and 2d, respectively). There was no red color on the outer or inner side (model C, 3e and 3f, respectively) of the innermost layer of the mask demonstrating no blood penetration. Two N95 FFR models (A and D) failed the test as shown by the blood color on the inner side of the masks. Model A had 3 layers of filter media. The outer and inner side (model A, 1a and 1b) of the outermost layer showed a wide area of the synthetic blood color. The middle layer had a relatively smaller area with color on the outer surface (model A, 2c), which diminished on the inner side (model A, 2d), indicating very little blood penetration. Surprisingly, a larger area of blood color was seen on the outer surface of the innermost layer (model A, 3e and 3f), which increased along the crease line on the inner side (model A, 3f) exposed to the face. The result was consistent between the different samples of the same model. The results are supported by the design of the respirator with different layers of filter media. The outer layer was thin and hydrophobic and blood was able to penetrate at the velocities tested in the study. The dense middle hydrophobic layer can be separated into 2 layers, but is considered as a single layer for simplicity. Although the hydrophobic middle layer appears to decrease blood penetration dramatically as shown by the reduction in the area of blood color, it actually allowed the blood to pass through it. This can be seen by the appearance of a wide area of blood color on the innermost hydrophilic layer, because of its affinity toward the water-based synthetic blood. In the case of model A  24  22  2  92  25  18  7  72  N95 FFR  B  25  25  0  100  25  25  0  100  N95 FFR  C  25  25  0  100  25  25  0  100  N95 FFR  D  25  20  5  80  25  16  9  64  N95 FFR  E  20  20  0  100  20  20  0  100  N95 FFR  F  20  20  0  100  20  20  0  100  Surgical N95 FFR  G  24  24  0  100  25  23  2 Test Velocity (cm/sec) D, there was an outer shell and 2 hydrophobic layers with a second shell layer in between (Fig 2, bottom panel) . The 2 hydrophobic layers were not sufficient to prevent blood penetration at the test velocities. The results indicate that the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media, packing density of the layers, and the arrangement of the layers on the outer or inner side of the mask may influence blood penetration. The penetration of synthetic blood through hydrophobic filter media layers raises a question on the interpretation of the test method. In the case of model A, the inner side of the middle hydrophobic layer showed only traces of blood color. However, blood penetration through the middle layer could be seen by the wide area of color on the outer and inner sides of the innermost hydrophilic layer. This indicates that the innermost layer should be made of a hydrophilic material to reveal penetration of synthetic blood. In the absence of a hydrophilic layer, the device may still allow blood penetration, but it may not be easily identified by the test method. The results indicate the need for the development of a more accurate test method that can identify blood penetration on the inner side of the mask with either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic layer.

The synthetic blood penetration test addresses the potential for infectious biologic fluids reaching/touching the human face in a surgical environment. There are scenarios in which splashes/sprays occur outside of surgical procedures. For example, significant volumes of respiratory secretions from infected individuals are released at high velocity in the form of a sneeze or cough, which can spray or splash on a nearby individual wearing an SM or FFR. The possibility that some devices may allow the penetration of biologic fluids exists because of the wide variation in their construction. The design of many surgical N95 FFRs and N95 FFRs prevents the inner surface of the respirators from touching a user's face. On the other hand, some models with a flat-fold type respirator may touch the facial skin during breathing, indicating that nasal secretions can diffuse through the mask under high humidity conditions of the mask. One study tested human subjects wearing SMs to evaluate the physiologic, thermal, and subjective influence of an SM on the wearer. 18 Those authors 18 reported that 11% of subjects complained about the SM sticking to the face during inhalation. Further studies are needed to understand the diffusion of biologic fluids through filter media in SMs, surgical N95 respirators, and FFRs.

The results for synthetic blood penetration tests obtained in our study may have implications for respirator use in the health care environment. FDA clears only a small percentage of NIOSHapproved N95 FFRs as surgical N95 respirators. The extensive use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical health care practices results in shortages during emergencies and pandemic events involving a respiratory pathogen. To address this issue, NIOSH could incorporate additional test requirements in 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval process to parallel the protections in the FDA clearance of surgical N95 respirators. Current FDA clearance procedures 3 accept NIOSH respirator certification in lieu of filter efficiency performance and differential pressure. In theory, similar arrangements for streamlined approvals could be made if NIOSH began evaluating fluid resistance as part of its certification process. Our study showed 4 out of 6 N95 FFR models approved by NIOSH but not cleared by FDA likely also meet the fluid resistance requirement for surgical N95 FFR clearance. Even the 2 N95 FFR models that demonstrated lesser fluid resistance ability still had pass rates of 80% and 92% at the lowest velocity, insufficient to meet requirements of the standard, but suggestive of ability to provide some level of fluid resistance. A detailed analysis of the pros and cons of NIOSH incorporating fluid resistance requirements into 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval and its influence on infection control policies and respirator shortages is outside of the scope of this article, but is needed.

The ability of all of the N95 FFRs tested to pass 80% or greater at the lowest velocity also presents an opportunity to scrutinize the need for this specific test in determining suitability of respirators for use in medical environments. For situations with increased respirator use like a pandemic, the need for protection against projectile blood at 435 cm/sec may be less common than the need for protection against lower-velocity splashes/sprays from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Additional studies are needed to determine whether non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs would be sufficient for these types of situations, but the preliminary data here are promising.

Limitations of this study include that only 6 non-FDA cleared NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models were tested for synthetic blood penetration. Additional models need to be tested to provide conclusive information on whether most N95 FFR models would meet existing FDA requirements for penetration resistance of synthetic blood. The ASTM F1862 standard test method requires 32 samples per model to obtain an acceptable quality limit of 4%. This means that 29 or more samples should pass the test. In our study, only 10-15 samples per model in each laboratory were tested for synthetic blood penetration. Future studies should use the 32 samples per model described in the ASTM F1862 standard test method. Other limitations include the subjective nature of the blood penetration test as well as the variation in the test results obtained by different test performers in the same laboratory as well as between laboratories.

Nevertheless, the synthetic blood penetration results obtained in the study indicate that many NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs may meet the FDA clearance requirement for synthetic blood penetration. Although many models would likely pass the synthetic blood penetration criterion, whether they would pass the flammability tests for FDA clearance remains to be evaluated. Studies on the blood penetration for longer times may provide information on any change in the penetration pattern, when the exposed mask is worn for a protracted period.

Four out of 6 NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models that were not cleared by FDA that were tested in our study showed resistance to synthetic blood penetration at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities. Similar results were obtained from a TPI laboratory. The combined results for resistance to blood penetration from the 2 laboratories indicate that these models may pass the FDA clearance process provided they also pass the flammability requirement. As expected, the numbers of respirator samples that failed the test increased with increasing test velocity. Respirator design, using different numbers of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media layers at different packing densities, may influence resistance to blood penetration.

A synthetic blood penetration test apparatus (Blood Spurt Tester, model SDL, Atlas LLC, Rock Hill, SC), similar to the 1 described in the ASTM standard, 12 was used in our study. The test apparatus consists of a specimen-holding fixture, a targeting plate, a pressurized fluid reservoir, a pneumatically actuated valve with an interchangeable canula (18-gauge stainless steel with an internal diameter of 0.084 cm), and a valve controller. The canula size was suitable to test synthetic blood penetration at arterial blood pressures ranging from 80-120 mm Hg corresponding to 450-635 cm/sec velocities. The specimen holder and the supporting frame of the fixture were rigid to resist the impact of the blood-spraying process. The height of the specimen holder was 420 mm, corresponding to the height of the synthetic blood reservoir. A targeting plate with a 0.5-cm hole was placed 1 cm in front of the mask to ensure that the synthetic blood hit the target area of the mask. The actuated valve was attached to a stable metal stand to withstand any flex during activation by the pneumatic control. The valve was positioned according to the ASTM F1862 method so that the exit of the canula was 30.5 cm from the point of impact on the specimen mask.

The fluid reservoir was filled with approximately 1 L fresh synthetic blood (Johnson, Moen & Co Inc, Rochester, Minn) and a canula was installed on the front of the pneumatically controlled valve. The canula used in the method is a 1.27-cm (0.5-in) long 18-gauge stainless needle with an internal diameter of 0.084 cm (0.033 in). The synthetic blood penetration test was performed only at velocities of 450 and 635 cm/sec, corresponding to blood pressures of 80 and 160 mm Hg, respectively. The reservoir pressure was adjusted to approximately 8 psi or 12 psi to achieve a velocity of 450 cm/sec or 635 cm/sec, respectively. The test apparatus was calibrated for each target velocity by delivering the synthetic blood for a 1-second difference in spurt duration. The weight of synthetic blood delivered for a 0.5 second and a 1.5 second spurt were collected in separate small beakers. The 2 weights of the samples were recorded and the difference between the 2 weights was calculated. According to ASTM F1862, the target difference in weight plus lower and upper limits for a velocity range should be within 2% of the target. The target difference in weights for the test at the target velocities of 450 and 635 cm/sec were 2.506 g and 3.537 g, respectively. In this study, the acceptable weight range was between 2.456 g and 2.556 g for the 450 cm/sec velocity and was between 3.466 g and 3.607 g for the 635 cm/sec velocity, which were within the specified ranges.

During testing, 2.0 mL (2.0 g) synthetic blood was directed to the test sample for durations of 0.825 seconds and 0.550 seconds corresponding to target velocities of 450 cm/sec and 635 cm/sec, respectively. After every 15 samples, a check was performed to ensure that the test apparatus was still delivering 2.0 g synthetic blood by collecting and weighing the output passing through the targeting hole. When the blood sample delivered showed a shift of >0.10 g, all prior data since the last calibration were discarded. The canula was also cleaned after testing 15 samples.

Before use, test samples were conditioned in an environmental chamber (Caron Environmental Chamber, model 6001-1, Marietta, Ohio) for 4-6 hours at a temperature of 21°C ± 5°C and 85% ± 5% relative humidity, to simulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the mask on a wearer. Each test sample was removed from the environmental chamber and was mounted on the testing apparatus, centered, and 2-mL synthetic blood was dispersed at the target velocity within a minute. The synthetic blood penetration through the sample was assessed visually. A control mask for each model for all category devices was used for comparison. A drop of the blood was placed on the inner side of the control mask and compared with the color on the inner side of the test sample.

The fluid resistance pass/fail data for each test velocity at the NIOSH laboratory and TPI laboratory were combined for statistical analysis. The data at the 2 different test velocities and the 2 laboratories were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test matched pairs using SPSS software (version 20, IBM-SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY). Of the 2 SM models tested in the study, model J showed penetration for 1 of 15 samples at both 450 and 635 cm/sec. The other model (ie, K) showed penetration for 3 of 10 samples at 635 cm/sec, but none at 450 cm/sec.

The synthetic blood penetration results obtained at the NIOSH laboratory were compared with the results obtained by the TPI laboratory ( Table 2) . The number of samples tested at each velocity at the NIOSH laboratory varied from 10-15 for each model, whereas, only 10 samples per model were tested at TPI laboratory. Despite the difference in the number of samples tested at the 2 laboratories, the penetration results obtained at NIOSH were comparable to those from the TPI laboratory. For example, the same 4 N95 FFR models (ie, B, C, E, and F) that showed no penetration at the NIOSH laboratory also had no penetration at TPI laboratory. Model A showed penetration for some samples at the 2 test velocities in both laboratories. Similarly, some samples of model D showed penetration at 635 cm/sec at both testing laboratories. No penetration was obtained for 1 surgical N95 FFR model (ie, H) at both 450 and 635 cm/sec in both testing laboratories. In the case of SMs, 1 model showed penetration at both velocities at the NIOSH laboratory, but, no penetration at TPI laboratory. The other model had penetration only at 635 cm/sec at the NIOSH laboratory, but at both velocities at the TPI laboratory. Overall, 11 of 22 test results were the same between the 2 laboratories. Although the NIOSH laboratory found more samples (ie, 7) with higher failure rates than the TPI laboratory (ie, 4), the difference was not statistically significant (P = . 327).

For FDA clearance, synthetic blood penetration for 32 samples of each device is evaluated using the ASTM F1862 standard test method to achieve an acceptable quality limit of 4% as defined in the American National Standards Institute/American Society of Quality Control 15 standard. An acceptable quality limit of 4% includes minor deviations from the standard, such as the acceptance of synthetic blood penetration for <3 samples (<9.4%). To pass the test, <3 samples can show penetration at 450 cm/sec (the lowest of the 3 test velocities) at a minimum. A device that passes the test only at 450 cm/sec indicates its lower fluid resistance level. A very high fluid resistant device passes the penetration test at all 3 velocities. Table 3 shows the blood penetration results for the total number of samples for all models tested in the study. The results for the NIOSH and TPI laboratory samples were combined, because only a limited number of samples were tested at each laboratory. Moreover, a similar trend in penetration was obtained between the 2 laboratories. Samples from 4 out of 6 models of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs showed no penetration. Of the other 2 N95 FFR models, model A had penetration for 2 of 24 samples at 450 cm/sec and 7 of 25 samples at 635 cm/sec, indicating that model A may pass the resistance test at 450 cm/sec, but not at 635 cm/sec. Model D showed penetration for several samples at the lower velocity at 1 of the laboratories (see Table 2 ), but not at the other. Because of the contradictory results obtained at the lowest velocity, whether model D will meet the fluid resistance requirement is uncertain. Three surgical N95 FFR models were tested in the study, of which only model H had no failures at either velocity. All samples of model G passed the test at 450 cm/sec, whereas model I had 1 sample that failed the test at 450 cm/sec. Two SM models were tested and only 1 of 20 samples of both models failed at the lowest velocity. For this initial study, we did not test the full recommended sample size of 32, so it is not possible to say with 100% certainty whether the N95 FFR models with <3 failures would meet the FDA clearance requirements or not. However, because four of the models had no failures even at the highest velocity for the first 20-25 samples, it would seem likely that they would pass if testing had continued to the recommended sample size. Surgical N95 FFR models H and I were specifically included in this study because they appear to be identical to 2 non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs models (ie, C and E). Models C and I are both flat-folding respirators from the same manufacturer and visually appear to be identical except for color (1 is orange and the other is white). Similarly, E and H are identical in appearance, except for the labeling and packaging. As shown in Table 3 , both pairs exhibited similar fluid resistance properties.

Overall, the results showed an increase in synthetic blood penetration with increasing test velocity (Fig 1) , similar to other studies. 16 For comparison between the 2 velocities, the pass/fail data obtained in the 2 test laboratories were combined.

The number of samples of the 3 categories of masks that showed penetration increased with increasing velocity from 450-635 cm/sec. N95 FFR, surgical N95, and SM masks showed penetration for 7, 1, and 2 samples at 450 cm/sec, which increased to 16, 4, and 8 samples at 635 cm/sec. The percentage of samples that showed penetration was significantly (P = .043) higher at 635 cm/sec than at 450 cm/sec. Penetration for large numbers of samples at higher velocity can be expected because an increase in the test velocity is likely to increase the permeability of the masks for fluids, including synthetic blood. Other factors include the configuration of the different types of filter media used in the multilayer construction of the mask. In general, the hydrophobic filter media-containing models are less likely to show penetration because of their ability to retard the penetration of a hydrophilic challenging test agent. The presence of a hydrophobic filter media on the outer surface may provide a barrier to the entry of hydrophilic water-based synthetic blood. 17 The lack of penetration of the devices may be maintained when the outer surface is hydrophobic and dry. Penetration can be expected when the outer layer is wet.

To gain more information on synthetic blood resistance of the mask, penetration through the different layers of the masks were analyzed visually. All of the models block the initial spray, but differences were found in how the synthetic blood moved through the layers of the device. Figure 2 shows the blood penetration through different layers of respirator models. A representative N95 FFR sample of model C, 1 of the 4 N95 models that passed the resistance testing, was analyzed for blood penetration through the different layers. Blood color was seen on the outer and inner sides of the outer layer (model C, 1a and 1b, respectively) and middle layer (model C, 2c and 2d, respectively). There was no red color on the outer or inner side (model C, 3e and 3f, respectively) of the innermost layer of the mask demonstrating no blood penetration. Two N95 FFR models (A and D) failed the test as shown by the blood color on the inner side of the masks. Model A had 3 layers of filter media. The outer and inner side (model A, 1a and 1b) of the outermost layer showed a wide area of the synthetic blood color. The middle layer had a relatively smaller area with color on the outer surface (model A, 2c), which diminished on the inner side (model A, 2d), indicating very little blood penetration. Surprisingly, a larger area of blood color was seen on the outer surface of the innermost layer (model A, 3e and 3f), which increased along the crease line on the inner side (model A, 3f) exposed to the face. The result was consistent between the different samples of the same model. The results are supported by the design of the respirator with different layers of filter media. The outer layer was thin and hydrophobic and blood was able to penetrate at the velocities tested in the study. The dense middle hydrophobic layer can be separated into 2 layers, but is considered as a single layer for simplicity. Although the hydrophobic middle layer appears to decrease blood penetration dramatically as shown by the reduction in the area of blood color, it actually allowed the blood to pass through it. This can be seen by the appearance of a wide area of blood color on the innermost hydrophilic layer, because of its affinity toward the water-based synthetic blood. In the case of model D, there was an outer shell and 2 hydrophobic layers with a second shell layer in between (Fig 2, bottom panel) . The 2 hydrophobic layers were not sufficient to prevent blood penetration at the test velocities. The results indicate that the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media, packing density of the layers, and the arrangement of the layers on the outer or inner side of the mask may influence blood penetration.

The penetration of synthetic blood through hydrophobic filter media layers raises a question on the interpretation of the test method. In the case of model A, the inner side of the middle hydrophobic layer showed only traces of blood color. However, blood penetration through the middle layer could be seen by the wide area of color on the outer and inner sides of the innermost hydrophilic layer. This indicates that the innermost layer should be made of a hydrophilic material to reveal penetration of synthetic blood. In the absence of a hydrophilic layer, the device may still allow blood penetration, but it may not be easily identified by the test method. The results indicate the need for the development of a more accurate test method that can identify blood penetration on the inner side of the mask with either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic layer.

The synthetic blood penetration test addresses the potential for infectious biologic fluids reaching/touching the human face in a surgical environment. There are scenarios in which splashes/sprays occur outside of surgical procedures. For example, significant volumes of respiratory secretions from infected individuals are released at high velocity in the form of a sneeze or cough, which can spray or splash on a nearby individual wearing an SM or FFR. The possibility that some devices may allow the penetration of biologic fluids exists because of the wide variation in their construction. The design of many surgical N95 FFRs and N95 FFRs prevents the inner surface of the respirators from touching a user's face. On the other hand, some models with a flat-fold type respirator may touch the facial skin during breathing, indicating that nasal secretions can diffuse through the mask under high humidity conditions of the mask. One study tested human subjects wearing SMs to evaluate the physiologic, thermal, and subjective influence of an SM on the wearer. 18 Those authors 18 reported that 11% of subjects complained about the SM sticking to the face during inhalation. Further studies are needed to understand the diffusion of biologic fluids through filter media in SMs, surgical N95 respirators, and FFRs.

The results for synthetic blood penetration tests obtained in our study may have implications for respirator use in the health care environment. FDA clears only a small percentage of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs as surgical N95 respirators. The extensive use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical health care practices results in shortages during emergencies and pandemic events involving a respiratory pathogen. To address this issue, NIOSH could incorporate additional test requirements in 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval process to parallel the protections in the FDA clearance of surgical N95 respirators. Current FDA clearance procedures 3 accept NIOSH respirator certification in lieu of filter efficiency performance and differential pressure. In theory, similar arrangements for streamlined approvals could be made if NIOSH began evaluating fluid resistance as part of its certification process. Our study showed 4 out of 6 N95 FFR models approved by NIOSH but not cleared by FDA likely also meet the fluid resistance requirement for surgical N95 FFR clearance. Even the 2 N95 FFR models that demonstrated lesser fluid resistance ability still had pass rates of 80% and 92% at the lowest velocity, insufficient to meet requirements of the standard, but suggestive of ability to provide some level of fluid resistance. A detailed analysis of the pros and cons of NIOSH incorporating fluid resistance requirements into 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval and its influence on infection control policies and respirator shortages is outside of the scope of this article, but is needed.

The ability of all of the N95 FFRs tested to pass 80% or greater at the lowest velocity also presents an opportunity to scrutinize the need for this specific test in determining suitability of respirators for use in medical environments. For situations with increased respirator use like a pandemic, the need for protection against projectile blood at 435 cm/sec may be less common than the need for protection against lower-velocity splashes/sprays from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Additional studies are needed to determine whether non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs would be sufficient for these types of situations, but the preliminary data here are promising.

Limitations of this study include that only 6 non-FDA cleared NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models were tested for synthetic blood penetration. Additional models need to be tested to provide conclusive information on whether most N95 FFR models would meet existing FDA requirements for penetration resistance of synthetic blood. The ASTM F1862 standard test method requires 32 samples per model to obtain an acceptable quality limit of 4%. This means that 29 or more samples should pass the test. In our study, only 10-15 samples per model in each laboratory were tested for synthetic blood penetration. Future studies should use the 32 samples per model described in the ASTM F1862 standard test method. Other limitations include the subjective nature of the blood penetration test as well as the variation in the test results obtained by different test performers in the same laboratory as well as between laboratories.

Nevertheless, the synthetic blood penetration results obtained in the study indicate that many NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs may meet the FDA clearance requirement for synthetic blood penetration. Although many models would likely pass the synthetic blood penetration criterion, whether they would pass the flammability tests for FDA clearance remains to be evaluated. Studies on the blood penetration for longer times may provide information on any change in the penetration pattern, when the exposed mask is worn for a protracted period.

Four out of 6 NIOSH-approved N95 FFR models that were not cleared by FDA that were tested in our study showed resistance to synthetic blood penetration at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities. Similar results were obtained from a TPI laboratory. The combined results for resistance to blood penetration from the 2 laboratories indicate that these models may pass the FDA clearance process provided they also pass the flammability requirement. As expected, the numbers of respirator samples that failed the test increased with increasing test velocity. Respirator design, using different numbers of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media layers at different packing densities, may influence resistance to blood penetration.

The efficacy of medical masks and respirators against respiratory infection in healthcare workers,We aimed to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in protecting against respiratory infections using pooled data from two homogenous randomised control clinical trials (RCTs).,"There is currently a lack of consensus around the efficacy of medical masks and respirators for healthcare workers (HCWs) against influenza, with only five published randomised control trials (RCTs) in HCWs conducted to date. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] While N95 respirators have been shown to be superior to medical masks in preventing clinical respiratory infection (CRI), influenza illness (ILI) and other outcomes, none of the studies were adequately powered to examine laboratory-confirmed influenza.

In the smallest of the trials, involving only 32 HCWs, there was no difference in the rates of respiratory illnesses between HCWs who used medical masks and the control group. 1 A Canadian study of 422 hospital nurses compared targeted use of N95 respirators and medical masks and found that the rate of serologically defined influenza was 25% in both arms. 2 However, in the absence of a control arm for comparison, the finding of no difference in outcomes between the intervention arms could represent either equal efficacy or equal inefficacy of the two interventions. The other two published HCW RCTs used a more specific and less sensitive definition of influenza based on nucleic acid testing (NAT) of respiratory specimens in symptomatic subjects.

As such, even these substantially larger RCTs were unable to demonstrate any significant difference in influenza infection between N95 respirators and medical masks. 3, 4 Finally, a recent study examined the efficacy of cloth masks compared to medical mask and control groups, and found that cloth masks may increase the risk of infection in HCWs. 5 Guidelines for respiratory protection have been driven by presumed transmission mode alone, and under an assumption that influenza and other pathogens are spread by one mode alone. 6 However, the paradigm of unimodal droplet or airborne spread is based on outmoded experiments from the 1940s, which concluded that only large droplets are found at close proximity to the patient, while small droplet nuclei and airborne particles are found at a longer distance. [7] [8] [9] It has since been shown that both small and large particles can exist at short distances from the patient, and that aerosolised transmission can occur at close proximity. 9 In our two published RCTs conducted in China, 3,4 we used the same outcomes, case definitions and measurement tools, and used the same testing methods for a range of different pathogens transmitted by different routes. This afforded an opportunity to pool the data from both trials for improved statistical power to examine the outcomes by pathogens and mode of transmission. The aim of this pooled analysis was to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in HCWs against respiratory infection.

We pooled the results of our two RCTs on mask and respirator use in hospital HCWs in Beijing, China. The first RCT (Trial 1) was conducted from December 2008 to January 2009, 3 

HCWs randomised to: medical mask arm (n = 492), N95 fit-tested arm (n = 461) and N95 non-fit-tested arm (n = 488). The rate of fit-test failure was very low (5/461) in this trial, so data from both N95 arms were combined for analysis.

An additional 481 healthcare workers from nine hospitals were recruited to a control arm. These hospitals were purposefully selected as they indicated low levels of routine mask/respirator use during a pretrial assessment. Participants in the control arms continued their usual mask wearing practices and were followed using the same protocol as applied to the other arms. 3 The second trial (Trial 2) was conducted from 28 December 2009 to 7 February 2010, using the same design. 4 In Trial 2, participants were randomised to three arms: medical masks at all times on shift (n = 572), continuous N95 respirators at all times on shift (n = 516) and targeted/intermittent use of N95 respirators only while doing high-risk procedures or barrier nursing of a patient with known respiratory illness (n = 521). Fit testing was not performed in the second RCT. In both trials, participants were followed for 4 weeks of wearing the medical masks or respirators, and an extra week of non-wearing of masks for the development of symptoms. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including gender, age, smoking, vaccination status, pre-existing medical illnesses, hand hygiene and high-risk procedures. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic participants, and samples were tested at the laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There was no major difference in the products used in both clinical trials. In the first trial, we used medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1820) and N95 fit/ non-fit-tested respirator (3M, catalogue number 9132). The following products were used in the second trial: medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1817) and respirator (3M, catalogue number 1860).

The interventions compared in the pooled analysis were as follows: (i) continuous use of N95 respirators (pooled data from both trials -1530 subjects); (ii) targeted N95 respirator use (data from trial 2-516 subjects); (iii) continuous use of medical masks (pooled data from both trials -1064 subjects) and (iv) and a control group (data from trial 1-481 subjects).

Only laboratory-confirmed outcomes were included in the analysis, which were defined and measured identically in both trials, and The laboratory testing has previously been described. 3, 4 Laboratory-confirmed bacteria and viruses identified in participants were categorised according to droplet (n = 285), contact (n = 6) and airborne (n = 3) transmission modes (Table S1A) . Sixty-one coinfection cases with multitransmission were categorised separately. (Table S1A) . As the largest number of confirmed infections was in the droplet category, we conducted a subgroup analysis of droplet-transmitted infections. Given there were a large number of RSV cases (n = 33) in our data set and RSV is variously categorised as | 513

either ""droplet"" 11 or ""contact"" spread 12 in different guidelines, we performed a sensitivity analysis by including RSV into the droplet transmission category instead of contact.

Ethics approvals of two clinical trials were obtained from the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

We did not involve patients and their families in the design and conduct of the study. We have acknowledged the support of participants, and the results will be published in open access journal.

The data sets from the two trials were pooled incorporating the common variables. We calculated the attack rate (proportion of outcome) of each of the four outcomes by the study arms.

We conducted a fixed effect individual patient data (IPD) metaanalysis by fitting a multivariable log binomial model, using generalised estimating equation (GEE) to account for clustering by hospital/ward. We used a fitted fixed effect model because there are only two trials.

Two studies were conducted in the same setting with similar participant characteristics, and they examined the same underlying effect.

In the analysis, relative risk (RR) was estimated using the control arm as the referent category after adjusting for potential confounders and their interaction terms with a trial ID number. The overall rates of seasonal infection were higher in the second trial than the first. The consistency assumption (ie between study homogeneity) for the IPD meta-analysis was tested by fitting an interaction term between trial ID and trial arms where a significant interaction is indicative of inconsistency. 13 Any interaction term (between trial ID and covariates other than trial arm) that was not a confounder was subsequently excluded from the model using backward elimination approach. This approach is described in detailed elsewhere. 4 We repeated the above-described methods for each of the outcomes.

After combining the data sets from the two trials, 3591 cases were In the IPD meta-analysis, none of the interaction terms between trial arm and trial ID was significant for any of the outcome variables.

Thus, the consistency assumption for the IPD meta-analysis was satisfied. However, a significant interaction was observed between trial ID and hand washing for laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation only; therefore, we estimated the RR for trial ID stratified by hand washing. In the similar analysis, the risk of influenza was also lower in medical mask arm compared to control; however, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.81 and 95% CI 0.25-2.68) arm. Table 5 compares the results of this analysis with the individual studies.

We demonstrated superior clinical efficacy of continuous use of N95 respirator (also known as ""airborne precautions"") against infections presumed to be spread by the droplet mode, including influenza. This suggests that transmission is more complex than assumed by traditional classifications, and supports the fact that both large and small droplets are present close to the patient, and that aerosol transmission may occur for presumed ""droplet"" infections. Respirators are designed to provide respiratory protection through filtration and fit, and properly fitted respirators provide better protection compared to medical masks. 3, 4 We could not demonstrate efficacy of medical masks against any outcome, but the non-significant trend appeared to be towards protection. Medical masks may well have efficacy, 5 but if so, the degree of efficacy was too small to detect in this study, and larger studies are needed, given the widespread use of these devices in health care. a diagnosis of influenza requires the detection of virus from respiratory specimens, or a fourfold rise in serological titres, both of which are highly resource-intensive and depend on daily subject follow-up and on optimal timing of specimen collection. For all these reasons, the published studies to date have been unable to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy against influenza infection between medical masks and N95 respirators. This study can therefore usefully inform policies for prevention of influenza.

In the first RCT, compared to medical masks, N95 respirators were found to be protective against CRI, but not against ILI or laboratoryconfirmed influenza. 3 When compared with the control arm, rates of laboratory-confirmed virus and bacterial colonisation were significantly lower in N95 arm (Table 5 ). In the second RCT, continuous use of N95 respirators was associated with lower rates of CRI and laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation compared to the medical mask use. 4 Pooled analysis of these studies improved the power to analyse other infectious outcomes by intervention and to allow analysis by mode of transmission.

An important finding of this analysis was the efficacy of N95 respirators against droplet-transmitted infections. Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet-transmitted infections such as influenza. 18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet-transmitted infections with a high-case fatality rate. 6 This study has some limitations. Firstly, the reporting of the results included in Figure 1 is different from the IPD meta-analysis results. This is due to the uneven distribution of randomisation arms and differing seasonal attack rates between the trials. In Figure 1 , these between-trial differences were not taken into account. The IPD meta-analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome. The major strength of this study is the use of the same endpoints, measurements and methods in the two trials, which allowed valid pooling of the data.

It is a long-held belief in hospital infection control that a mask is adequate for droplet-transmitted infections. We showed that the use of respirators provides better protection against respiratory infections, even those presumed to be spread predominantly by the droplet mode. The targeted use of a respirator was also effective, whereas no efficacy was demonstrated for medical masks alone.

However, the trends suggest some degree of protection from medi- 3. For many infections, more than one mode of transmission is possible, and our data suggest that transmission of infections is more complex than suggested by these paradigms.

Clinical efficacy data are a higher level of evidence than theoretical paradigms of transmission, and show better protection afforded by respirators.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of N95 respirators and medical masks to protect healthcare workers in China from respiratory infections,"Background: There are substantial differences between the costs of medical masks and N95 respirators. Costeffectiveness analysis is required to assist decision-makers evaluating alternative healthcare worker (HCW) mask/ respirator strategies. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of N95 respirators and medical masks for protecting HCWs in Beijing, China. Methods: We developed a cost-effectiveness analysis model utilising efficacy and resource use data from two cluster randomised clinical trials assessing various mask/respirator strategies conducted in HCWs in Level 2 and 3 Beijing hospitals for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 influenza seasons. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per clinical respiratory illness (CRI) case prevented. We used a societal perspective which included intervention costs, the healthcare costs of CRI in HCWs and absenteeism costs.","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting influenza and other respiratory infections compared to the rest of the adult working population [1] . The use of respirators and masks to reduce transmission of these infections within hospitals can decrease the costs associated with HCW absenteeism and the costs of nosocomial infections in vulnerable patients. Mask/respirator availability can also be crucial in the context of emerging respiratory infection threats to

HCWs where effective pharmaceutical interventions may not be available, e.g. the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks since 2012 [2, 3] .

Medical masks, referred to as surgical masks in some countries [4] , were not designed to protect the wearer from aerosol transmission of droplet nuclei and viral particles [5, 6] . Respirators are specially engineered for this purpose [7] . The N95 respirator models have been tested and proven to have at least 95% particle filter efficiency [8] . The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the use of a mask in low-risk settings and a respirator in high-risk settings (e.g. during aerosol generating procedures) to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from seasonal influenza [9, 10] . In the context of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, the WHO recommended similar precautions to those advised for seasonal influenza while the CDC recommended at least the equivalent of a fit tested N95 respirator for HCWs in contact with pandemic influenza patients, even when aerosol-generating procedures were not being conducted [11, 12] .

There are substantial differences between the costs of respirators and masks that may affect the development of country specific mask/respirator guidelines for HCWs [4] . Another potentially important consideration is fit testing, which adds to the cost of respirator use, but may help ensure the seal of a respirator to a HCW's face [7] . A recent review identified the lack of economic evaluations that used clinical efficacy estimates to assess the cost-effectiveness of mask/respirator use in healthcare settings [13] . The aim of this present study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of respirator and mask interventions in HCWs using data from two large clinical trials conducted in Beijing hospitals [14, 15] .

The two previously published cluster randomised trials used in this economic evaluation [14, 15] were designed to measure the efficacy of N95 respirators and medical masks to protect HCWs from respiratory infections in Beijing hospitals. In these trial designs, the units of randomisation were entire emergency departments or respiratory wards from Level 2 and 3 hospitals, assigned to each intervention. The participants were the HCWs working in each of the enrolled wards, i.e., all nurses, doctors and administration staff. These wards were selected as they were considered to be high-risk settings for occupational exposure to respiratory infections. The intervention period in the first trial (Trial 1) was during the winter of 2008/09, from December 2008 to January 2009 [14] . The second trial (Trial 2) intervention period followed in the winter of 2009/10, from December 2009 to January 2010 [15] .

In Trial 1 continuous use of fit tested and non-fit tested N95 respirators was compared to medical masks [14] . Continuous use referred to the wearing of N95 respirators or medical masks for the entire shift. It was deemed unethical to randomise wards to a control arm (i.e. no mask use), so a convenience sample of HCWs from hospitals with documented pre-study low rates of mask use was recruited. This arm was excluded from this economic analysis due to the lack of randomisation. In Trial 2 there were two fit tested N95 respirator arms and the difference between these arms was that one arm employed continuous respirator use while the other carried out targeted (i.e. selective) respirator use by HCWs only whilst conducting high-risk procedures such as common aerosol-generating procedures, or when barrier nursing patients with known respiratory illness. These arms were compared to a continuous use medical mask arm (as used in Trial 1).

In Trial 1, the number of HCWs per arm was 492, 461 and 488 for the continuous medical mask, continuous N95 fit tested and continuous N95 non-fit tested arms respectively. In Trial 2, the number of HCWs per arm was 572, 516 and 581 for the continuous medical mask, targeted N95 fit tested and continuous N95 fit tested arms respectively. The criterion for clinical respiratory illness (CRI) in both trials was the presentation of two or more respiratory symptoms or one respiratory symptom and one systemic symptom [14, 16] . Respiratory symptoms considered were cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sore throat and sneezing. Systemic symptoms considered were a temperature > 38°C, perceived chills and/or fever, lethargy, loss of appetite and myalgia.

The respirators and masks used in both trials were sourced from the manufacturer 3 M China [14, 15] . As the models supplied in Trial 1 had been discontinued for China by the following season, different models of the same respirator and mask types were supplied in Trial 2. Both trials included at least one arm that applied qualitative fit testing for participating HCWs once at the beginning of the trial period, according to the manufacturer's instructions [17] .

We adopted a societal perspective, as recommended by the WHO cost-effectiveness analysis guidelines [18] . We included the costs for the interventions in addition to inpatient and outpatient costs to the healthcare system for HCW CRI cases. Indirect (productivity) costs were included for 15 min of staff time lost while being fit tested for respirators and due to HCW absenteeism for CRI. The only out-of-pocket costs included were the costs of medications and outpatient visits to healthcare centres/fever clinics and emergency wards for CRI. Other potential out-of-pocket costs incurred to HCWs with CRI, such as healthcare co-payments and direct non-medical costs (e.g. transport costs) were excluded as no trial data was collected on these items.

We applied a decision analytic model using Microsoft Excel to construct a separate economic evaluation for each trial. Costs and health outcomes were not discounted as the time horizon of the analysis was less than one year (28 days). The primary outcome was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per CRI case prevented. This was chosen as CRI in HCWs was the primary endpoint in both trials (CRI cases in patients were not recorded). A one-way sensitivity analysis was carried out on a range of parameters to identify those that most substantially impacted on the ICER. In scenario analysis we examined seasonal variation in attack rates for CRI (from 1-30%) [1] to capture values outside of those observed in the years the trials were run.

Before adjusting for confounding, Trial 1 found that only the continuous use non-fit tested N95 arm was significantly more protective against CRI than medical masks [14] . However, a combined ' All N95' arm, which included both fit tested and non-fit tested N95 groups (there was no significant difference between these groups), was found to be significantly more protective in post-hoc cluster confounder adjusted analysis compared to medical masks [14] . For these reasons, we calculated our ICER results for this trial using the efficacy estimated for this ' All N95' arm. However, to explore the impact of fit testing on cost-effectiveness, we selectively either included/excluded the cost of fit testing for those in the ' All N95' arm. For Trial 2, after the results were cluster and confounder adjusted, only the continuous use fit tested N95 arm had a significantly more protective effect compared to medical masks [15] . We excluded the targeted use fit tested N95 arm from the economic analysis as there was no significant difference in results for this arm when compared to medical masks [15] .

The CRI rates observed in each of the arms of the trials were used when reporting preliminary results for all arms, however when estimating ICERs, CRI rates were generated from the intention-to-treat cluster and confounder adjusted significant efficacy results from both trials [14, 15] . Information on intervention efficacy, the number of respirators or masks used per shift and shift durations, were obtained from the trial publications [14, 15] . Data on HCW resource use due to CRI cases, the exact proportions of each staff type in each arm, the number of shifts worked and the number of days of leave taken, were extracted from the trial databases. Healthcare resource use costs for treatments were sourced from the Beijing pharmaceutical sunshine procurement platform [19] . Estimates were used for the costs of visits to healthcare centres or emergency departments and staff monthly salary costs (Xiaoli Wang, Beijing CDC, personal communication, July 2014). The estimated salary costs were comparable (approximately) with the National Bureau of Statistics China average health and social work salary for 2014 [20] . Costs are reported in 2014 US Dollars and 2014 Chinese Renminbi using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 6.2RMB ( Table 1) .

For both trials separately, respirator and mask costs per HCW for each arm were calculated by multiplying the mean number of shifts worked in the 28 day trial periods, by the cost of either two N95 respirators or three medical masks as provided per HCW for each shift worked in the trials [14, 15] . HCWs worked an average of 20 shifts in Trial 1 and 22 shifts in Trial 2 over the trial duration, with a typical shift being eight hours in duration.

For fit tested arms, the mean cost of 15 min of HCW time to be fit tested was included, taking into account the proportion of each staff type (doctors, nurses, etc.) in the trial. Fit tester time was included as the cost of 15 min of an administration staff member's time per HCW, US $1.98 (12 RMB) in Trial 1 and US $1.81 (11 RMB) in Trial 2. This cost (calculated from monthly salaries) was estimated to be different between the trials as HCWs worked slightly more shifts per month on average in Trial 2. As test operators can be self-taught we did not include any training costs [17] . The respirator, mask and fit test kit costs applied are shown in 

Information on the direct healthcare resource use of each HCW who was documented as having a CRI during the trials was collected through surveys completed in person. HCWs who had symptoms were required to report to the ward head nurse for survey completion. This provided data on the different types of treatment used by the HCW for a specific CRI episode and on the number of healthcare centre/fever clinic visits and emergency ward visits. This was used to calculate the mean cost of CRI for a HCW in each trial.

Indirect costs, in terms of productivity loss due to HCWs taking leave for a CRI episode, were estimated using the human capital approach [21] . The mean leave cost per HCW with CRI in each trial was calculated taking into account the proportions of each staff type that took leave. The productivity cost per day of leave was calculated by dividing mean monthly income by the average number of shifts for all HCWs in the 28 days trial period (i.e. 20 shifts in Trial 1 and 22 in Trial 2).

In Trial 1 the CRI attack rates for those allocated to continuous N95 use were 4.6% and 3.3% (with/without fit testing respectively) and 6.7% for those allocated to the medical mask use arm (Table 2 ) [14] . In Trial 2, the CRI attack rate was 7.2% for those allocated to fit tested N95 respirators compared to 17.1% for those allocated to the medical mask use arm (Table 2 ) [15] . These were also compared to a CRI attack rate of 11.8% for the targeted use fit tested N95 arm in Trial 2 [15] , which was excluded from further analysis due to lack of statistical difference compared to the medical mask arm.

Intervention costs per HCW in Trial 1 for the 28 days were US $32.07 (199 RMB) in the continuous use nonfit tested N95 arm. They were nearly two-fold higher for the continuous use N95 fit tested arm at US $60.40 (374 (12) Beijing pharmaceutical sunshine procurement platform [19] Antitussives (e.g. Apricot cough syrup 250 ml bottle) 4 .03 (25) Beijing pharmaceutical sunshine procurement platform [19] Antipyretics (e.g. Paracetamol 12 tablets)

Chinese Medicine (e.g. Ganmao Qingre Granules) 10 bags 1.93 (12) Beijing pharmaceutical sunshine procurement platform [19] Healthcare [20] RMB) and were US$8.53 (53 RMB) for the medical mask arm ( Table 2) . Results for Trial 2 were similar, with intervention costs per HCW of US$61.31 (380RMB) for both N95 arms and US $9.35 (58 RMB) per HCW for the medical mask use arm (Table 2) .

The mean CRI costs per HCW case were low in all arms compared to intervention costs ( Table 2 ). The most commonly reported treatment used by those with CRI in both trials (56% in Trial 1 and 30.5% in Trial 2) was traditional Chinese medicines (commonly Ganmo Qingre Granules, US $1.93 [12 RMB]). A breakdown of mean CRI costs per HCW and mean intervention costs per HCW for respective trial intervention arms is shown in Fig. 1 

The cost-effectiveness estimates described below are focused around the intention-to-treat trial efficacy results for N95 respirators which showed a significant protective effect against CRI, when compared to medical masks, after adjusting for clustering and confounding (shown in bold in Table 2) .

In Trial 1, when we included the cost of fit testing, the ICER for continuous N95 respirator use was US $1224 (7589 RMB) per CRI case prevented when compared to medical mask use. In Trial 2 the ICER was US $489 (3032 RMB) for continuous fit tested N95 respirator use when compared to medical mask use. The difference between the trials is primarily explained by the higher CRI attack rates in Trial 2 ( Table 2) .

In Trial 1, when we excluded the cost of fit testing, the ICER for continuous N95 respirator use was US $549 (3404 RMB) per CRI case prevented when compared to medical mask use. In response to the relatively low fit test failures observed in both trials of 1.1-2.6% [14, 15] , we 

One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that CRI attack rate and intervention effectiveness have the greatest impact on the ICERs (Fig. 2) . In scenarios where we assumed the attack rate was greater than approximately 4% for continuous non-fit tested respirators and 8% for fit tested respirators, the ICERs were below US $1000 (6200 RMB) per CRI case prevented (see Fig. 3 ). The importance of the attack rate is also shown by the overlap in the Trial 1 and 2 results for the N95 continuous fit tested arms when we modelled the same background CRI attack rate in the medical mask arm (see Fig. 3 ).

In both trials the ICER worsened substantially when the lower effectiveness values from the trial confidence intervals were applied (see Table 3 and Fig. 2) . Sensitivity analysis was also carried out on costs for treatment including healthcare visits and the impact of doubling and halving the cost of N95 respirators (see Table 3 and Fig. 2 ). The potential for the interventions to be cost-saving was only estimated when we assumed a severe illness treatment cost for each CRI case (US $525, 3255 RMB) [22] . This is an extreme scenario and is unlikely except in a highly pathogenic influenza epidemic/pandemic where a mean case requires substantial healthcare treatment. 

We estimated that the incremental cost to prevent a CRI case in a HCW for continuous N95 respirator interventions compared to medical masks ranged from US $490-$1230 (3000-7600 RMB) in this setting, which is in the acceptable range. We found that including fit testing in a N95 respirator intervention approximately doubles the cost of the intervention and substantially decreases the cost-effectiveness per CRI case prevented compared to medical masks during seasons with a low CRI attack rate. However, these results must be interpreted with caution as the low respirator fit test failure rates (1.1-2.6%) observed in the trials may be specific to the N95 respirator models used in both trials [14, 15] . A potential policy option could be to forego fit testing if respirators with known low fit test failure rates were used (such as those used in the trials), although this decision requires careful consideration and would depend on the severity of circulating pathogens. This incremental approach to considering the additional costs and benefits of fit testing may be particularly important in settings where resources are limited and choices must be made between fit testing and other potential lifesaving interventions. At present there is insufficient literature to support that the low failure rates seen in the trials would apply for all respirator models.

We also found that variation in the CRI attack rate was a major factor in determining the cost-effectiveness of respirators (see Fig. 2 ). The higher attack rate in Trial 2 was most likely due to the more active influenza season observed in the 2009/10 influenza season [14, 15] . The incidence and severity of CRI cases which occur in any given year will vary in accordance with the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the annual influenza strains that are circulating during that season. The incremental cost per CRI case prevented for continuous use N95 respirators compared to medical masks was found to be substantially lower in high attack rate seasons (Fig. 3) . It is important that this seasonal variation is accounted for when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of influenza prevention measures [23] .

Whilst the results of our study are indicative of costeffectiveness, economic evaluations are not usually seen as transferable between settings. Mask/respirator interventions in HCWs need to be evaluated for countries separately to account for inter-country variations in factors such as intervention acceptability [24, 25] , healthcare costs and productivity costs. Variation within countries is also possible and hence the results of this study which only includes trial data from Beijing hospitals may not be generalisable to all settings in China.

China has comparatively high cultural acceptability of mask/respirator use compared to western countries [26] . Furthermore, a study of Beijing HCWs regarding A(H1N1)pdm09, suggests that some HCWs in this setting may continue to attend work with symptoms of influenza like illness [27] . This may partially explain the relatively low levels of absenteeism for HCWs with CRI in the trials. The low mean healthcare costs for CRI in both trials may have been due to the relatively modest influenza seasons and low levels of healthcare seeking by staff [14, 15] . The existing economic studies on masks/respirators have suggested that the interventions were likely to be cost-effective in the high income settings they examined [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, it is difficult to compare the results of our evaluation to these previous high income setting studies as they often did not report results in an easily comparable format (e.g. cost per case prevented) and most did not use clinical trial efficacy data to inform their analyses [33] .

A limitation of the original trials was the 28 day duration [14, 15] meaning that the results may not translate to longer term interventions which may have different adherence levels. A limitation of our analysis is that the effect of the interventions on CRI rates in the patients or family members of HCWs could not be included due to the absence of data. The exclusion of these factors will make our results more conservative. HCWs are known to transmit various types of nosocomial infections to patients [34] and the literature indicates that there are likely to be substantial benefits if the number of patients with CRI is reduced [22] . For example, the benefits of preventing HCW infection transmission through vaccination have been observed in long-term care facilities that found an associated decrease in mortality in their elderly residents [35] [36] [37] . The difference in mean direct healthcare costs per HCW with CRI between the trials (i.e. US $5.45 [34 RMB] in Trial 1 and US $2.60 [16 RMB] in Trial 2) may partly reflect variation in the thoroughness of the sick follow-up data collection between the trials. Another potential limitation of this study is that stochastic uncertainty was not directly explored using the individual level data from the trials [21] . Instead, we adopted a decision-model based approach using clinical trial data to inform input parameter values and explored the uncertainty of these values in deterministic sensitivity analyses. This approach facilitated a focus on forms of uncertainty unrelated to sampling, such as the potential inter-year variation in the CRI attack rate. Finally, as data on quality of life were not collected in the trial we chose to focus the economic analysis on the primary trial outcome (CRI). This limits the ability to compare the value for money offered against other interventions.

This economic evaluation is the first economic analysis of mask/respirator interventions to be conducted for a middle income setting and it is one of the first to make use of clinical trial evidence [14, 15] . This evaluation provides valuable evidence that can be used by decision makers to help assess the costs and benefits of alternative HCW mask/respirator protection strategies. The determination of cost-effectiveness will depend on the willingness to pay to prevent a CRI case in a HCW and this varies between countries and is not easily transferrable between different settings. The extent to which a decision maker is likely to focus on cost-effectiveness evidence when it comes to HCW protection will in part depend on the seriousness of the infections being prevented [33, 38] . In the case of a highly pathogenic pandemic, respirator use in HCWs would likely be a cost-effective intervention.

Clinical Infectious Diseases Healthcare Workers' Strategies for Doffing Personal Protective Equipment,"Background. Personal protective equipment (PPE) helps protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from pathogens and prevents cross-contamination. PPE effectiveness is often undermined by inappropriate doffing methods. Our knowledge of how HCWs approach doffing PPE in practice is limited. In this qualitative study, we examine HCWs' perspectives about doffing PPE.","Effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers (HCWs) is an important component of infection prevention in healthcare settings. PPE (eg, gowns, gloves, masks) protects HCWs from contamination with infectious agents and helps prevent cross-contamination to other patients. However, PPE effectiveness is influenced by how HCWs wear and doff (remove) PPE, which was highlighted prominently by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) [1] .

Despite wearing PPE for their safety, HCWs routinely selfcontaminate while doffing PPE, with self-contamination rates as high as 46%-90% across PPE types (eg, gowns, gloves) and scenarios [2] [3] [4] . For example, Kwon et al [5] found that among HCWs asked to doff either contact precautions or EVD PPE, 26% and 44% contaminated themselves, respectively. Casanova et al [6] found contamination on 53% of inner gloves and 13% of scrubs worn by HCWs trained specifically in EVD PPE. In an observational study, Kang et al [3] estimated that 66% of HCWs potentially contaminated themselves when doffing PPE after caring for patients in isolation precautions.

Contamination commonly results from critical doffing errors [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] , even when HCWs believe they are proficient in doffing [11] . When HCWs doff complex PPE for a high-risk scenario such as EVD, they often make errors during key ""vulnerable processes, "" including when reaching for equipment during the doffing process and when removing respirators and hoods [8] [9] [10] . During more routine contact precautions, HCWs often selfcontaminate when removing gloves [2, 12] and gowns [7, 13] . Several factors may contribute to self-contamination, including poorly fitting or ""universally sized"" PPE [14] [15] [16] , difficulty distinguishing between dirty (outside) and clean (inside) surfaces while doffing [14] , and forceful or rushed movements [14, 17] . HCWs may use incorrect doffing sequences or methods that do not work well with the PPE design [17] . Furthermore, doffing protocols are often not standardized [15] , and HCWs may receive suboptimal and inconsistent PPE training [18] , leading to further confusion regarding appropriate doffing approaches.

Our understanding of doffing practices and factors that contribute to self-contamination is growing but is largely based on examination of PPE doffing protocols for high-consequence infectious agents, such as Ebola virus. Furthermore, we have limited knowledge about HCWs' perceptions and thoughts about doffing PPE. In this study, we focused on HCWs' perceptions of doffing PPE used in routine care, and we examined how HCWs approach doffing, what they think about and pay attention to while doffing, and what factors facilitate or inhibit their ability to doff.

This qualitative study was part of a larger simulation study to investigate doffing practices with methods that include task analysis, contamination count and location analysis, eye tracking, basic anthropometry measurements, and participant thinkaloud interviews. We briefly describe the larger study to provide context. All findings reported here are based on qualitative participant interviews; findings that pertain to other data collected will be reported in future articles. The study was reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board.

We recruited 30 HCWs and students (medical and nursing students doing clinical rotations who use PPE) at a large teaching hospital in the Midwestern United States. We excluded faculty and staff who did not have clinical patient care duties and students who were not doing clinical rotations. After obtaining written consent, we conducted anthropometry measurements and asked participants to fill out a demographics questionnaire.

Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios. The first 10 participants used standard gloves and 3 mask designs: procedure mask with ear loops, surgical mask with ties, and pouch-style mask with headbands. The next 10 participants used standard gloves and 2 gown designs: over-the-head isolation gown with break-away neck closure and thumb loops and isolation gown with tape-tab neck closure and elastic cuffs. The last 10 participants used 2 glove designs: standard nonsterile nitrile exam gloves and Doffy gloves (nonsterile exam gloves with a Doffy flap, a doffing aid positioned in the wrist area [19] ). We examined the participants with a black light to assess baseline contamination, asked them to don the PPE items, and sprayed them with Glo Germ fluorescent marker. We then instructed participants to doff PPE as they would in practice. Because participants were not familiar with Doffy gloves, we showed them the Doffy flap and explained that it was to help them doff the gloves. After participants doffed the PPE, we reexamined them with a black light to assess self-contamination and asked them to thoroughly wash their hands and faces. The study was conducted in a simulation room where the whole sequence was video-recorded from 4 angles.

We reviewed the video recordings with the participants and conducted short (typically about 10 minutes) semistructured interviews using the retrospective think-aloud method [20, 21] . In these interviews, we asked participants open-ended questions to explain their doffing approach and to share what they were thinking about or paying attention to at each step in the process. We paused or rewound the video, asked follow-up probing questions, and reviewed the donning process as necessary. The interviews were audio-recorded (after obtaining verbal consent) and transcribed verbatim.

We analyzed the transcripts using both a priori (deductive) and emergent (inductive) codes [22] . The a priori codes were overarching themes that reflected our research questions, and the emergent codes were subthemes identified within each overarching theme. One investigator (J. B.) started developing and refining the codebook based on a sample of transcripts and met periodically with 2 medical anthropologists on the team (H. S. R., K. D.) to discuss and refine the themes. After the codebook was finalized, J. B. coded the remaining transcripts. To further enhance reliability, a second coder (J. P. S.) randomly selected and coded 2 transcripts from each simulation scenario (6 total, or 20% of all transcripts). The 2 coders met to compare the coded content and found that the codebook did not need to be revised. They discussed coding differences until they reached agreement. After coding the overarching themes, J. B. examined the coded content within each theme to identify and enumerate the most prominent response patterns, which he compared and grouped together into subthemes using comparative analyses [23] . Finally, to identify any systematic differences, we determined whether occurrence of subthemes varied across PPE types and designs and by HCW type. Table 1 . We identified 3 overarching interview themes: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies focused on how participants generally approached doffing PPE. Cognitive processes focused on what participants thought about or paid attention to while doffing PPE, chiefly reflecting how they carried out the strategies or how they overcame unanticipated issues and doffing barriers. Barriers and facilitators addressed factors that helped or hindered doffing (eg, PPE design, personal factors). Table 2 includes exemplar quotes to illustrate each theme.

In the following sections we describe each theme and its subthemes and we highlight differences across PPE types and designs and by HCW type (as applicable). We also include the number of participants who discussed each subtheme (in parentheses); however, the numbers are provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for statistical inference. Furthermore, comparison across HCW types should be interpreted with caution because the sample size was small, different groups of HCWs were unequally represented in the 3 doffing scenarios (which could bias group comparisons), and since the subthemes emerged later in our analyses, we did not solicit responses that pertained to specific subthemes during the interviews (ie, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).

We identified 2 subthemes of doffing strategies: doffing safely and doffing expediently. Most participants (n = 29) described trying to doff safely and minimize the likelihood of selfcontamination, primarily by avoiding contact with the surfaces they perceived as contaminated (eg, front of the gown, outside surface of the gloves) and using gestures to better control PPE (eg, not ripping PPE off or ripping in a careful, controlled manner). About half of the participants (n = 17) also described doffing expediently, which involved approaches to doffing PPE quickly and with minimal burden (eg, ripping PPE off) or using shortcuts and work-arounds (often initiated at donning; eg, not fastening gown straps). Participants who described both strategies did not specify which strategy was their priority, but some noted that doffing expediently could undermine safety.

We found that response patterns for doffing strategies varied across PPE types and designs. In the mask simulation scenario, the tension between safety and expediency tended to be most pronounced for the surgical mask with ties (which can be ripped off). For example, several participants tried to untie the mask because they thought it would be safer to remove that way, though some admitted that in practice they would probably rip the mask off. However, most participants described using both strategies to doff gowns and typically did not see much conflict or tension between them. While ripping gowns was not perceived as inherently unsafe, some participants described difficulties ripping gowns off in a controlled manner or described other barriers (see Cognitive Processes and Barriers and Facilitators). For gloves, most participants described only doffing safely; they mentioned expediency (or lack thereof) only in reference to alternative glove doffing methods (eg, the ""beak method""), which they rarely use in routine practice. We also found that doffing expediently was less commonly reported by physicians (2/6) than other HCWs (15/24).

Participants described several things they thought about or paid attention to when doffing (and also donning) PPE. Most commonly (n = 20) they described tracking PPE surfaces they thought were most likely contaminated and trying not to touch them. About half of the participants (n = 14) also described looking for PPE design cues (eg, the type of fastener used), often starting this process while donning the PPE. These cues helped suggest the optimal doffing method, particularly when the HCW was not familiar with the PPE item. In unforeseen circumstances (eg, doffing unfamiliar PPE designs, encountering doffing barriers), participants also tended to improvise approaches that made sense to them, typically relying on training or experience with similar PPE designs (n = 7).

Participants' responses regarding cognitive processes did not vary notably across different PPE types and designs. Tracking contaminated surfaces and looking for design cues were more common with gowns than with masks and gloves, and improvising was more common with masks and gowns than with gloves. Four participants described relying on muscle memory and not thinking much at all when doffing gloves. Furthermore, we found that tracking PPE surfaces was more commonly reported by students (5/5) than other HCWs (15/25) and that looking for PPE design cues was also more commonly reported by students (4/5) than other HCWs (10/25).

Doffing barriers and facilitators typically pertained to PPE design. Participants identified the fasteners (eg, bands, straps) on masks and gowns as particularly problematic. For example, a common barrier was the (perceived) need to untie certain mask and gown designs (n = 14). Knots were often behind participants' heads or backs, making them hard to find or hard to reach (particularly for HCWs with mobility issues). Sometimes knots were also hard to untie. Furthermore, when untied, the loose fasteners or the PPE itself could be hard to control and could pose a contamination risk. Several participants described workarounds that prevented or minimized the problem of untying PPE (n = 5), such as tying just 1 knot, not tying the fasteners while donning, or simply ripping the PPE off rather than untying the fasteners. However, ripping off PPE was not easy with certain designs (n = 7), particularly the masks with bands and the gowns with thicker belts. Some participants also found the gown with the tape-tab neck closure harder to rip off in a predictable and controlled way. While gloves were not associated with the barriers described above, several participants (n = 6) described difficulty safely doffing the glove on the second hand (because the other hand was exposed). PPE fit was also a barrier to doffing all types of PPE (n = 10), typically when PPE fit too tightly. However, while 2 participants found tighter-fitting gowns harder to doff, 2 participants found looser-fitting gowns harder to doff. Participants also identified personal barriers (n = 10), such as wearing personal items (glasses, watches), having long hair, and having mobility issues. However, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. For example, procedure masks with ear loops were the easiest to doff for participants who wore glasses. Some participants also admitted that they struggled to recall the correct doffing approach, but they generally described remembering or ""figuring out"" how to doff correctly. Finally, 3 participants explicitly commented on the benefit of using familiar PPE designs because it allowed them to rely on their doffing habits.

In this study, we examined how HCWs perceive and think about doffing PPE in routine care settings. Our findings indicate that HCWs seek a balance of safety and expediency when doffing PPE. While doffing, they track and avoid contact with PPE surfaces they think are likely contaminated. When doffing unfamiliar PPE items or in other unforeseen circumstances, HCWs tend to improvise and rely on PPE design cues, prior training, and experience with similar PPE. We identified several factors that facilitated or impeded doffing, most of which were related to PPE design, such as type and location of fastener and fit.

HCWs are often aware that they violate doffing protocols [17, 24] and are cognizant of the trade-offs between safety and expediency. HCWs in clinical practice are busy and use PPE frequently, which likely influences them to doff more expediently than they would otherwise. They may be more likely to doff expediently in routine care, which they perceive to be low risk, particularly if they see PPE as self-protection rather than a measure to prevent cross-contamination [24, 25] . These findings suggest that efforts to improve PPE use and doffing should address both safety and expediency through new and improved PPE designs, doffing methods, training approaches, and organizational policies and procedures.

We found some differences between groups of HCWs. Physicians were less likely to report doffing expediently, which could either mean they are less likely to acknowledge during an in-person interview that they doff expediently or that doffing expediently is less salient to them. The difference in salience could be due to differences in clinical practice workflows. For example, Harrod et al found that during routine care, physicians (and physical therapists) don and doff PPE much less frequently than nurses [26] . This suggests that different HCWs groups have unique PPE needs and challenges and that each group may require a training program tailored to their clinical practice. We also found that students were more likely to report tracking potentially contaminated PPE surfaces and looking for PPE design cues. While other HCW types may have simply omitted this information from their responses (eg, it may be self-evident to them that one would do those things while doffing), it may also suggest that more experienced HCWs have internalized cognitive processes associated with specific tasks and, thus, may perform tasks such as PPE doffing without consciously processing relevant information, relying rather on muscle memory and habits.

Our findings indicate that PPE should be redesigned in ways that facilitate expedient and safe doffing methods. Design cues could help HCWs envision and execute appropriate doffing methods; for example, color-coding PPE surfaces to differentiate ""dirty"" outside surfaces from ""clean"" inside surfaces could help HCWs track where these surfaces are at each step of the doffing process [16, 27] . Fasteners (eg, straps, belts) that do not require untying and are easy to undo (or rip) quickly would facilitate speed and ease of doffing [16, 27] . PPE also must fit people of different sizes and physical abilities and should be either adjustable or available in several sizes [14, 27] . In addition, new doffing methods and additional training may be required to optimize HCWs' doffing of redesigned PPE. The new PPE designs and doffing methods also must be rigorously tested, not only for efficacy in ""ideal"" and controlled settings but also for effectiveness in practice. If HCWs use work-arounds to avoid doffing PPE with cumbersome but safe methods, it may be prudent to design PPE that leads to fewer work-arounds and allows for better compliance with doffing methods in practice, even if such designs and methods are shown to be somewhat less safe in controlled settings. In addition to efficacy and effectiveness studies, well-designed ethnographic and human factors approaches can help us better understand the variety of factors that influence HCWs' ability to doff in routine clinical practice, where and why critical errors occur, and how to improve usability of PPE and doffing methods.

New training approaches may help improve HCWs' doffing performance [2, 18] . Our findings indicate that HCWs draw on prior training experiences when encountering new PPE designs or facing doffing barriers, suggesting that PPE training should cover the range of PPE types and designs HCWs may encounter in clinical practice and the most appropriate doffing methods for each. HCWs should also be given just-in-time training if their standard PPE is replaced with a new style during shortages or vendor changes. Furthermore, HCWs could benefit from training that would help them assess how to doff unfamiliar PPE or improvise solutions when they encounter doffing barriers or PPE failures (eg, if the gown shreds into multiple pieces). New training approaches must be tested for effectiveness [18] . While computerized training may be prevalent [18] , HCWs may prefer hands-on practical training [24] , which would also allow for feedback on self-contamination with fluorescent markers [2] and would allow HCWs to develop muscle memory. HCWs at different stages (eg, in-school vs on-the-job training) may also need different training approaches. Thus, training protocols should accommodate HCWs' level of experience and the work they perform.

Finally, hospitals and other healthcare organizations can play an important role in implementing needed changes and sustaining high performance over time by providing necessary support [3, 16, 28] . Hospitals should consider assembling interdisciplinary teams to periodically review and revise their PPE protocols [16] . PPE protocols must be clear and unambiguous in order to provide guidance for key processes, from PPE selection to its use in practice. After carefully examining their PPE needs, hospitals could eliminate unnecessary variation in PPE designs to minimize the likelihood that HCWs would encounter unfamiliar PPE, and they could procure PPE that is safe and expedient to use and doff. Furthermore, hospitals could tailor their PPE training approaches for the PPE available at their institution in order to increase the likelihood that HCWs use appropriate doffing methods. HCWs may require refresher training, particularly if new PPE designs are introduced into practice or they start working in new settings that use different PPE designs. To maintain or improve performance over time, hospitals should monitor compliance with PPE use and doffing protocols and investigate reasons for poor performance.

Our study had several limitations. First, all participants were recruited at 1 teaching hospital and its affiliated schools. Common influences (eg, institutional policies and procedures, training, available PPE) may have limited the range of perspectives we identified in the study. However, participants' work experience (in years) varied substantially. Thus, participants likely were initially trained at different times, in different institutions, and with different PPE designs, which should mitigate this limitation. Second, the simulation context of our study (eg, presence of observers, simulation room, recording, fluorescent marker, other prompts) may have influenced participants to pay closer attention to doffing and particularly to avoiding self-contamination, leading them to adopt different doffing approaches than they use in practice, or bias their interview responses. Furthermore, in a simulation study, we could not account for the range of tasks and circumstances that HCWs encounter in day-to-day practice but may influence doffing performance (eg, carrying objects while doffing [17] ). Thus, we may have not explored the full range of factors that influence HCWs' PPE doffing practice.

This study contributes to the literature on PPE doffing performance and self-contamination by focusing on HCWs' perspectives. HCWs try to balance safety and expediency when doffing PPE, which triggers various cognitive processes during doffing. Different PPE designs can facilitate or inhibit HCWs' doffing practices. These findings have implications for designing the next generation of PPE and new doffing methods, developing and implementing PPE training protocols, and revising policies and procedures in hospitals and other healthcare organizations.

SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF PROTECTIVE FACEMASKS AND AIR-PURIFYING RESPIRATORS HHS Public Access,"Speech Intelligibility (SI) is the perceived quality of sound transmission. In healthcare settings, the ability to communicate clearly with coworkers, patients, etc. is crucial to quality patient care and safety. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the suitability of the Speech Transmission Index (STI) methods for testing reusable and disposable facial and respiratory personal protective equipment (protective facemasks [PF], N95 filtering facepiece respirators [N95 FFR], and elastomeric half-mask air-purifying respirators [EAPR]) commonly worn by healthcare workers, 2) quantify STI levels of these devices, and 3) contribute to the scientific body of knowledge in the area of SI. SI was assessed using the STI under two experimental conditions: 1) a modified version of the National Fire Protection Association 1981 Supplementary Voice Communications System Performance Test at a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of −15 (66 dBA) and 2) STI measurements utilizing a range of modified pink noise levels (52.5 dBA (−2 SNR) − 72.5 dBA (+7 SNR)) in 5.0 dBA increments. The PF models (Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818) had the least effect on SI interference, typically deviating from the STI baseline (no-mask condition) by 3% and 4% STI, respectively. The N95FFR (3M 1870, 3M 1860) had more effect on SI interference, typically differing from baseline by 13% and 17%, respectively for models tested. The EAPR models (Scott Xcel and North 5500) had the most significant impact on SI, differing from baseline by 42% for models tested. This data offers insight into the performance of these apparatus with respect to STI and may serve as a reference point for future respirator design considerations, standards development, testing and certification activities.","Speech Intelligibility (SI) and clear communication among healthcare workers (HCWs) are vital components of healthcare delivery systems and occupational safety. This is especially true in times of public health emergencies and disaster situations. With approximately 13 million HCWs in the United States, clear communication in healthcare has a broad scope with significant impacts. SI is the quality or condition of speech being intelligible and clearly understood. It is well-documented that hospitals are often loud environments, which makes the issue of SI challenging. Hospital noise levels have been rising consistently since the 1960s. The background noise levels in hospitals rose from 57 dBA in 1960 to 72 dBA today during daytime hours, and from 42 dBA in 1960 to 60 dBA today during nighttime hours (1) . The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for hospital noise levels are 35 dBA during the day and 30 dBA at night in patient rooms, with recommended nighttime peaks of 40 dBA (2) . Many studies indicate that peak hospital noise levels often exceed 85 dBA to 90 dBA (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Noise from alarms and certain equipment that exceeds 90 dBA (for example, portable X-ray machines) are comparable to walking next to a busy highway when a motorcycle or large truck passes. These increased noise levels can pose significant challenges to communication among hospital staff and with patients. Busch examined hospital noise levels reported in 35 published research studies over the last 45 years (1) . It was found that not one published study reported noise levels that complied with the WHO guidelines for noise levels in hospitals (1) .

(which includes SI) was recently deemed not practical for inclusion in a draft B95 standard (19) . The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has also identified communication interference as a key issue to be studied and rectified in the next generation of facial and respiratory PPE developed for HCWs (14) .

Previous studies involving SI have primarily employed the use of the Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) in clinical settings or controlled listener/speaker orientations (20) . The MRT is standardized under the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S3.2 1960 and involves a listener attempting to properly identify certain key words preceded by a carrier sentence. For example, Radonovich et al. found that the odds of correctly hearing a word spoken by a HCW wearing an EAPR in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting was approximately 0.46, compared with other commonly used respirators in the same location, on average (20) . However, the MRT involves human test subjects, causing results to be variable and validity to be diminished based on each individual's unique variations in speech and the way listeners interpret those variations in speech. Sample size has also been small in previous studies, which may have decreased reliability (20) . Human subject testing is also time-consuming, expensive, and often leads to incomplete data sets due to test subject attrition. Furthermore, the spoken words in the MRT are not industry specific, which plays a vital role in a field such as healthcare where highly technical words and sentence structures are used, as well as numerous acronyms.

Recently, an alternative method for assessing speech transmission, called the Speech Transmission Index (STI), has been applied to respirators and included in a voluntary consensus standard for Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) in their 1981 Standard on Open-Circuit SCBA for Emergency Services (2013 edition). STI testing is a quantitative and objective method of speech transmission quality assessment in the presence of ambient (pink) noise. The STI was developed in the 1970s and is standardized under the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 60268-16. In contrast to subjective methods used to measure SI, the STI offers the advantages of being objective, highly repeatable, reproducible and time-efficient. A single value is calculated by the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) using the signal-to-noise ratios per octave band with weightings that reflect the SI. The STI uses seven octave bands in the range of 125Hz to 8000Hz.

The objectives of this collaborative study between the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (Pittsburgh, PA) and respirator manufacturer Scott Safety Inc. (Monroe, NC) were to 1) assess the suitability of the STI method in the NFPA 1981 standard for testing facial PPE commonly worn by HCW, 2) quantify STI levels of these devices, and 3) contribute to the scientific body of knowledge for Project BREATHE and other research in the area of SI.

The facial and respiratory PPE models and sizes selected and used in this study are summarized in Table I . Three types of facial PPE were tested: 1) N95 FFR, 2) PF and 3) EAPR. Each model was selected based on U.S. market share, ubiquity in healthcare workplace settings, use in previous studies (20) , and tolerability among healthcare workers based on previous occupational health studies (21, 22) . SI interference of these PPE have not been previously investigated to this degree under such controlled conditions as utilized in this study. Furthermore, SI interference of these types of PPE has not been extensively investigated utilizing a quantitative methodology such as the STI. It must be noted that the EAPR models tested did not contain voicemitters (also known as speaking diaphragms).

The STI component of the NFPA 1981 standard method was developed for tight-fitting, full facepiece SCBA respirators and thus is in need of validation for use on other respirator types. To assess the method for respirator and facial PPE use it was desirable to examine both repeatability measurements within each sample donning, and reproducibility measurements between each sample donning. The NFPA method requires three facepiece samples, each of which is donned on the manikin five times, with three measurements taken during each donning, for a total of 45 measurements. To assess repeatability within each donning, it is desirable to have a sample size larger than three repeats. Ideally, 28 measurements per sample and donning would need to have been performed in order to achieve the desired statistical power of 0.90. This would have led to a total of over 1,500 measurements for the six models tested. However, due to time constraints, this power level was not within the scope of this study. In an effort to increase the number of repeat measurements, the current study used three respirator samples, which were donned three times with five measurements taken during each donning. Utilizing this type of measurement protocol allowed for a better assessment of repeat measurements in a consolidated timeframe, while still maintaining a sufficient quantity of replicates.

The test system setup conforming to the NFPA 1981 standard for SI testing was used for all experimental conditions. Testing took place at Technicon Acoustics (Concord, NC) inside a hemi-anechoic chamber. The test setup schematic is shown in Figure 1 per the NFPA 1981 Standard. Outside the hemi-anechoic chamber, a computer (Dell, Round Rock, TX), two graphic equalizers (Behringer-Willich, GE), pink noise generator and acoustic analyzer (NTI Audio AG, Schaan, LS) and STI test output signal were used. Inside the hemi-anechoic chamber, a K.E.M.A.R HATS Manikin (GRAS, Holte, DE), pink noise speaker and microphone (NTI Audio AG) were used. Prior to initiating each test, each model containing a nasal bar (3M 1860, 3M 1870, KC Tecnol 49214 and 3M 1810F) was molded to the K.E.M.A.R manikin in the same manner that a human would in order to achieve the best fit possible, not a protective fit. Figure 2 further depicts the STI testing setup inside the hemianechoic chamber and specifies equipment distances. All equipment was set up and calibrated conforming to the NFPA 1981 standard each day prior to testing by staff familiar with the testing setup, system and calibration of equipment.

SI was measured for each PPE sample utilizing the STI under two different experimental conditions: 1) STI measurements using a modified version (3 samples × 5 replicate measurements) of the NFPA 1981 standard and a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of −15 (66 dBA) and 2) STI measurements utilizing modified pink noise levels of 52.5 dBA (−2 SNR) to 72.5 dBA (+7 SNR) in 5.0 dBA increments to further characterize the SI of each facepiece. Three donnings of each facial PPE sample were performed under each experimental condition with five replicate measurements per donning. To ensure consistency, the same investigator performed each donning. Each STI value was measured directly in front of the K.E.M.A.R HATS Manikin at 1.5m per NFPA 1981. This distance was re-measured and readjusted inside the hemi-anechoic chamber when necessary to ensure the utmost accuracy ( Figure 2 ).

Five STI measurements were taken for each sample (n=3) of each facepiece model (facepiece model n=6) per background noise decibel range (52.5, 57.5, 62.5, 67.5 and 72.5 dBA. This resulted in 25 STI measurements per sample (5 measurements × 5 background ranges) for a total of 75 STI measurements (25 measurements × 3 samples) per model.

Data analysis was completed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and Microsoft Excel. For this study it was desirable to examine both repeatability (defined as variability in measurements within each sample donning) and reproducibility (defined as variability in measurements between sample donnings).. The NFPA method requires three face piece samples, each of which is donned on the manikin five times with three measurements taken during each donning for a total of 45 measurements. To assess repeatability within each donning it is desirable to have a sample size larger than three repeats, ideally 28 measurements per sample and donning would have been performed in order to achieve the desired power of 0.90 (the implemented modification had a negligible impact on the power). This would have lead to a total of over 1500 measurements for the six models under test. The modified version of the NFPA method was utilized in order to yield more STI measurements per facepiece sample to assess the variability and repeatability. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each respirator model comparing the means by sample (3 samples per model) and donning (3 donnings per sample) as well.

To assess the repeatability of measurements, standard deviations for this testing were compared against two sets of data; one from MRT testing performed by Coyne and Barker and another STI study performed by Symons (23, 24) . For the STI method to be considered a suitable SI measurement for facial and respiratory PPE worn by HCW, the standard deviation should be less than those found by Coyne and Barker using the MRT to evaluate full facepiece air-purifying respirators (24) . The standard deviations found during the tests should also be similar to those found by Symons (23) when testing SI of full facepiece respirators using the NFPA 1981:2013 method. At the time of this study, no STI testing had been done on the respirator models utilized in this study, so the data from full facepiece respirators was used as a comparison of the means and standard deviations. This is illustrated in the data shown in Table II .

To assess reproducibility of the measurements, the means of each sample were compared between donnings of the same sample. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each full facepiece respirator tested comparing the means by sample and donning. The differences in means between each donning were again compared to data from full facepieces tested using the NFPA method from Symons (23) . The differences in means should be similar to data from Symons (23) . Upon closer examination of the standard deviations in Table III of each sample donning, it is noted that the largest standard deviation is 0.026 (3M 1860), with the average deviation across all models, samples, and donnings being 0.012. A chi-square test for SD less than 0.03 shows that the standard deviations of 41 of the 54 sample donnings were less than 0.03 STI or 3% of full scale with a 90% confidence interval.

From Coyne and Barker, the average standard deviation among listeners across all 12 full facepiece samples using the MRT method was 9.9% (24) . From Symons, the average standard deviation across all three facepieces and 7 test runs was 0.014 STI when using the NFPA STI method (23) . The standard deviations found in this study (0.012 STI) were less than those found by Coyne and Barker using MRT (9.9%) and similar to those found by Symons (0.014 STI) (23, 24) . Day 1 Testing-For the first experimental condition, the difference in means were assessed using a one-way ANOVA for each model sample. For both N95 FFR models (3M 1860 and 1870), the data from each sample donning is not statistically different (p > 0.05). Similarly, for the PF (KC 49214 and 3M 1818), the data from each sample donning can be considered statistically equivalent with p > 0.05. For the EAPR's (North 5500 and Scott Xcel), only sample 3 in each case was found to be statistically equivalent. For the North 5500, the maximum difference in means between donnings was 0.052 for sample 1 and 0.042 for sample 2. For the Scott Xcel, the maximum difference in means between donnings was 0.024 for sample 1 and 0.052 for sample 2. Figure 3 shows data from the second experimental condition (STI measurements utilizing modified pink noise levels of 52.5 dBA (−2 SNR) to 72.5 dBA (+7 SNR) in 5.0 dBA increments. The graph in Figure 3 illustrates that significant differences in SI exist between the different classes of PPE tested and the effect of background noise. This is shown in the boxplot illustrating STI scores by model in Figure 4 at a background noise level of 57.5 dBA (−15 SNR). Overall, the PF (Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818) had the least effect on SI interference, typically deviating from the STI baseline (no-mask condition) by 3% and 4% STI for the Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818, respectively. The N95FFR had more effect on SI interference, typically differing from baseline by 13% for the 3M 1870 and 17% for the 3M 1860. The EAPR's had the most significant impact on SI, differing from the baseline by 42% for the Scott Xcel and 45% for the North 5500.

The STI score ranges from 0 to 1.0 as shown in Figure 5 and predicts the likelihood of words and sentence comprehension. Table IV illustrates the relationship between the STI, subjective intelligibility measures, and intelligibility ratings. A value of 0 is equivalent to a very poor SI, while 1.0 is an ideal channel with excellent speech transmission. The products tested in this study fall into the poor/fair (EAPR), good (N95 FFR), and excellent (PF) ranges.

From the results of both experimental conditions, it is seen that PF have the least impact on SI under these test methodologies followed by N95 FFR and EAPR. PF yielded the highest STI scores during both experimental conditions, most likely due to the thinness and type of materials used in their design and that they do not adhere as firmly as N95 and EAPR to the face, allowing sound to dissipate through gaps in the PF-to-face contact area. However, unlike the N95 and EAPR, the PF is not intended for respiratory protection. From a design perspective, the potential gains that could be made to both the N95 FFR class and PF class in terms of SI would be incremental.

Some of the overall trends observed here (EAPR < N95 FFR < PF) agree with those from human subject studies (20) . In one set of experiments, Radonovich et al. (20) reported that the North 5500 EAPR showed a speech intelligibility rating of 72% compared to an 85% average from six disposable N95 FFRs (including the 3M 1860 used in this study) and one powered air purifying respirator. However, unlike this study, word intelligibility between PFs and N95 FFRs were not found to be statistically different. According to Table IV , the STI value of 0.45 found for the North 5500, falls in the upper range of the ""poor"" quality category or lower range of ""fair"", corresponding roughly to an intelligibility between 67% and 87%, that is consistent with a previous study which reported an average three foot MRT score of 73% and 88% (Tables II, III Radonovich et al. (20) ), depending upon the experimental conditions. Likewise, the one N95 FFR (3M 1860) common to this study (average STI = 0.71) and the Radonovich (20) study resulted in an average three foot MRT score of 91%, which falls in the middle of the ""good"" quality category.

Based on the data from this investigation, a minimum pass/fail criterion of ≥70 (0.70 STI) with respect to the NFPA STI standard is suggested as a baseline for current facial PPE, in the development of future B95 respirator standards (19) . Facial and respiratory PPE with an STI of ≥70 fall within the ""good"" quality range according to IEC 60268-16 (Table IV) . Further support for setting this level as a baseline can be found when comparing the results of this study with the Radonovich et al. study (20) . The 3M 1860 N95 FFR with an STI of 0.71 was not found to be statistically different from control (no facial PPE) using the MRT (see Table II , Radonovich et al. (21) ). Thus, facial and respiratory PPE with STI values ≥70 likely have little negative impact on SI.

Beyond facial and respiratory PPE design factors, controlling background noise in the healthcare environment will be paramount in improving SI in future healthcare environments. This can be accomplished through architectural design improvements, engineering controls and quieter equipment. As shown in Figure 3 , with increasing background noise SI decreases and the differences between the PPE types quickly shrinks. Furthermore, a HCW using either an N95 FFR or a PF loses little with respect to SI. Thus, reducing background noise will be one of the most effective ways to improve SI in healthcare environments.

Limitations of this study include time, non-human testing, uni-directionality and difficulty to generalize findings based on the limited number of samples used for each PPE type. A nonhuman modality was undertaken for this study for the purposes of objectivity and time constraints. The uni-directionality of testing was performed in order for the results to be valid, consistent and reproducible. Testing in multiple angles or distances would considerably increase the amount of time and resources needed. The surgical masks used were a flat-fold design whereas the N95 FFRs were cup-shaped (3M 1860) and tri-fold (3M 1870), rendering them further away from the face when donned. No models tested contained exhalation valves or voicemitters, which may have an effect on SI.

If SI becomes a performance requirement for future ""B95"" respirators, the STI methodology used in this study could be used for testing and certification requirements and standards development. Also, independent replication of this experimental work would provide validation of the STI method as a reliable methodology for testing different types of PPE. Data could also be used for benchmark testing and design improvements for manufacturers of facial and respiratory PPE. Further investigation into a more diverse range of models and sizes under different conditions (different directions, reverberation, etc.) would be valuable contributions as well. Future studies should identify the design features that could lead to EAPRs and N95 FFRs with STI scores in the excellent range, which would allow a higher B95 standard STI pass/fail criterion to be considered (e.g., 0.75) in the future.

The PF models studied here (Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818) had the least effect on SI interference, typically deviating from the STI baseline measurement (no-mask condition) by 3% and 4% STI. The two N95FFR models (3M 1870 and 1860) had a greater effect on SI interference compare to the PF models, typically differing from the STI baseline measurement by 13% for the 3M 1870 and 17% for the 3M 1860. The two EAPR models (Scott Xcel 742 and North 5500) had the most significant impact on SI, differing from the baseline STI measurement by 42% for the Scott Xcel and 45% for the North 5500 shows the sounds pressure levels per octave band for each respirator model during the testing with the background noise at 52.5 dbA (−15 SNR). Figure 6 illustrates why the EAPRs performed worse than the N95's and surgical masks. Examining the sound pressure level in the 1kHz to 4 kHz range, it is noted that the sound pressure level for both EAPR models is lower than baseline by approximately 10 dBA at 1kHz, 20 dBA at 2kHz and 15 dBA at 4kHz. This indicates that the STI signal sound pressure level has been significantly attenuated by the EAPR facepiece in these frequency ranges. Furthermore, at the 2kHz and 4 Khz frequencies, the sound pressure level of both EAPR models is nearly equivalent to the background noise level. Thus, the STI signal is masked by the background noise and intelligibility in these key frequency ranges is significantly degraded. To a lesser degree the same observation can be made about the N95 respirators (3M 1860 and 3M 1870) .

The thinness and thickness of the materials used in the construction of the respirators and the materials themselves (e.g. silicone vs. polypropylene) may also be contributing factors to the variation in STI scores between respirator models and samples. The rigidity, type and number of materials used in the speech path are all contributing factors to the STI score. These factors should be taken into consideration and investigated further as the next generation of facial PPE is developed.

Reusable elastomeric air-purifying respirators: Physiologic impact on health care workers,"Background: Elastomeric air-purifying respirators offer the benefit of reusability, but their physiological impact on health care workers is unknown. Methods: Ten health care workers exercised at 2 health care-associated work rates wearing an elastomeric air-purifying respirator. Mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide) were sampled, and physiological parameters were monitored (heart rate, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide). Numerical rating scales were used to evaluate comfort and exertion. Results: Compared with controls (no respirator), significant decreases in the breathing rate at both work rates (P , .05) and increases in tidal volume at the lower work rate (P , .01) were noted with respirator use. Approximately half the subjects had transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels above the upper limit of normal after 1 hour of use. Although well tolerated, comfort was negatively impacted by elastomeric air-purifying respirators wear. Conclusion: Reusable elastomeric air-purifying respirators impose little additional physiological burden over the course of 1 hour at usual health care work rates. However, the potential for carbon dioxide retention in a significant proportion of users exists and requires further investigation.","The current pandemic influenza and previous experience with other respiratory infectious outbreaks (eg, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome) have raised concerns about the availability of disposable N95 filtering face piece respirators (N95 FFRs). Given the very real possibility of N95 FFR shortages, elastomeric air-purifying respirators (EAPRs) for health care workers (HCWs) have been suggested as one alternative. 1 These are reusable, air-purifying respirators with face pieces made of pliable materials (eg, silicone, rubber, plastic) that employ 1 or 2 particulate filters and come in full face piece or half-mask models, of which the latter is the more commonly used in health care. 2 Compared with disposable N95 FFRs, EAPRs offer advantages that include improved face seal (for some wearers), easier donning and doffing, enhanced user seal check capability, ability of the face piece to be decontaminated multiple times, capacity for use by single or multiple HCWs, and potential cost savings during a pandemic. [2] [3] [4] [5] Widespread use of EAPRs in the health care industry has not occurred, 5 and little is known about their physiological impact on HCWs. This study, part of a larger investigation of multiple types of respiratory protection equipment that was carried out over 6 months, 6 was undertaken to determine the physiological burden imposed on HCWs when wearing an EAPR.

Ten HCWs (7 women, 3 men), none of whom had previously used an EAPR, were recruited. Demographic variable means included the following: age, 25.1 years; body weight, 76.0 kg; height, 169.1 cm; and body mass index, 26.4. Nine subjects had never smoked, and 1 subject had not smoked in .1 year (20 pack year smoking history). The study was approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Human Subject Review Board, and all subjects provided oral and written informed consent.

Physiological parameters (heart rate, breathing rate, tidal volume) were monitored with the LifeShirt Ò System (VivoMetrics, Ventura, CA), a lightweight spandex vest incorporating physiological sensors and circumferential respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) bands. Minute ventilation was calculated as the product of breathing rate 3 tidal volume. The LifeShirt Ò was calibrated against a fixed volume immediately prior to each trial. Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations (percentage) in the EAPR dead space were sampled at 18 samples/second (total sampling volume of 500 mL/ min) via a 2-mm internal diameter sampling line attached to a port in the EAPR face piece (positioned equidistant between nares and mouth) that directed samples to gas analyzers (AEI Technologies, Naperville, IL). The gas analyzers were calibrated before each trial with gas mixtures weighed into the cylinder using a balance that has been calibrated with weights that are certified to the National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. 7 Continuous oxygen saturation and transcutaneous carbon dioxide values were obtained with the Tosca 500 Monitor (Radiometer, Copenhagen, DK), a heated (428C) combination pulse oximeter and Severinghaus-type PCO 2 sensor that is earlobe mounted. The unit was calibrated over a 10-minute period immediately prior to use.

A single model EAPR (North 5500; North Safety, Providence, RI) that incorporates 2 P-100 filters was selected for the study because it had previously been shown to be well tolerated by HCWs 8 (Fig 1) . To ensure proper fit, quantitative respirator fit testing was carried out with the PortaCount Ò Plus (TSI, Shoreview, MN). All subjects attained fit factors $100 (ie, ratio of ambient particles to within-face piece particles), indicating #1% leakage, the level required by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration for half mask respirators. 9 Subjects donned the LifeShirt Ò and were tested in athletic shorts, tee shirts, and athletic shoes (no headgear of any type [eg, caps, head nets, or others] was worn). The EAPR was donned according to the manufacturer's instructions, negative and positive user seal checks 10 were carried out with the sample line pinched off, and the Tosca 500 sensor was attached to the left earlobe. Subjects were exercised for 1 hour (cumulative length of respiratory protective equipment use per shift by nursing staff 11 ) in a randomized fashion at each of 2 treadmill rates representative of HCW activities 12 that have been used in other studies 13, 14 : (1) 1.7 mph (2.74 km/h) treadmill speed (0% grade) that equates to stationary work (eg, writing nursing notes, using a telephone, and others) and (2) 2.5 mph (4.03 km/h) treadmill speed (0% grade) that equates to some bedside nursing patient care activities. Data were compared to 15-minute control values (no EAPR use) for the same subjects, at the same randomized work rates, and obtained no more than 3 weeks prior (15-minute values were considered valid for control purposes because, at relatively low intensity steady state exercise, steady state respiratory parameters are achieved in 3-6 minutes in healthy subjects 15, 16 ). Numerical rating scales (ie, modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion [numerical range, 0-5; least to most exertion 17 ]; modified Perceived Comfort Scale [numerical range, 1-5; most comfortable to least comfortable 18 ]) were utilized for subjective evaluations of exertion and comfort. Speaking was allowed ad lib by subjects throughout the trials to mimic HCW communicating with staff, patients, and visitors. At the end of each trial, subjects filled out questionnaires related to any subjective sensations experienced (eg, facial heat, sweating, and others) or design features (pinching, odor, and others) causing discomfort. EAPRs were weighed pretrial and post-trial to determine moisture retention. A new EAPR was utilized for each of the 2 sessions, and there was a minimum 30-minute respite between sessions. The study laboratory average temperature was 21.768C (range, 20.18C -22.48C) and the relative humidity averaged 58.3% (range, 47.4%-71.5%).

All physiological data and respirator dead space CO 2 and O 2 data are reported as means (standard deviation). The time of the sessions is 1 hour, and all variables are reported as mean 1-minute values at 5 time increments (1, 15, 30, 45 , 60 minutes [Tables 1 and 2]). One-hour averages were used for the statistical analysis because no significant changes over time were observed at the individual time increments. To assess differences between the EAPR and controls at the 2 intensity levels during 1 hour of exercise, a 1-way (4 conditions) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. To determine differences for physiological variables, repeated-measures ANOVAs for oxygen saturation, partial pressure of transcutaneous carbon dioxide, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, and heart rate were performed. Significant differences were further analyzed utilizing pair-wise comparisons tests with least significant differences adjustments with the a level set at P 5 .05. Paired t tests were performed to examine respirator dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide responses to EAPR at the 2 exercise intensities. Exertion scores, comfort scores, and EAPR weights were analyzed by paired t tests. SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses.

All subjects were able to complete all trials. Compared with controls, the EAPR resulted in significant decreases in breathing rate at both work rates and significantly increased tidal volume at the 1.7-mph work rate; otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in measured physiological variables (Tables 1 and 2) There were no significant differences in mean mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space carbon dioxide concentrations at 1.7 mph and 2.5 mph (P 5 .61) or respirator dead space oxygen concentrations at 1.7 mph or 2.5 mph (P 5 .80) ( Table 2 ). There were no significant differences between controls and EAPR in mean exertion scores at 1.7 mph (P 5 .67) and 2.5 mph (P 5 .96), mean comfort scores (P 5 .67 for both comparisons), or EAPR moisture retention (P 5 .72) ( Table 3) . Subjective complaints and EAPR features associated with discomfort are listed in Table 3 .

The study data indicate that the use of an EAPR by healthy HCWs, over 1 hour at work rates associated with the health care environment, was associated with statistically significant decreases in the breathing rate at 1.7 mph (P 5 .02) and 2.5 mph (P 5 .03) that was compensated by a significant increase in the tidal volume at 1.7 mph (P 5 .009) and nonsignificant increase at 2.5 mph (P 5 .14) compared with controls (Table 3) . This is not unexpected because all respirators alter breathing patterns, and the increased ventilation associated with the (generally) greater dead space of the EAPR compared with FFRs (eg, N95 FFR, and others) usually employed by HCWs, favors an increase in tidal volume over breathing rate because it is more efficient from an energy standpoint. 19 A recent review concluded that respirator use has little impact on minute volume during resting or low-intensity work conditions like those normally encountered in health care environments. 20 Mean absolute increases in transcutaneous carbon dioxide with the EAPR at 1.7 mph (13.2 mm Hg) and 2.5 mph (12.1 mm Hg) were not significantly different from controls (P 5 .09, P 5 .27, respectively). Of concern is the finding that mean transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels, averaged over the course of the last 15 minutes of the EAPR use, were elevated (ie, .45 mm Hg) in 4 of 10 subjects at the 1.7-mph work rate (range, 46-56 mm Hg) and 5 of 10 subjects at the 2.5-mph work rate (range, 45.4-62.8 mm Hg), despite the EAPR being equipped with an exhalation valve that presumably allows for a smaller proportion of the exhaled breath (and associated carbon dioxide) to be retained in the respirator dead space (all subjects were asymptomatic of hypercapnia). 21 Furthermore, at the 2 work rates, the mean mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space oxygen concentrations (17.85%, 17.81%, respectively) and respirator dead space carbon dioxide concentrations (2.50%, 2.47%, respectively) did not meet Occupational Health and Safety Administration ambient workplace standards (ie, ,19.5% is considered oxygen deficient; maximum 0.5% carbon dioxide as an 8-hour time weighted average), 22 although these standards apply to the workplace, not to respirators. Oxygen saturation was not adversely affected. Nonetheless, this raises concerns that extended continuous EAPR wear (.1 hour) might lead to further increases in transcutaneous carbon dioxide that could be deleterious to the wearer. Also, the impact of mild-to-moderate EAPRassociated increased retention of carbon dioxide upon specific subgroups of HCWs who might be more susceptible to hypercapnia (eg, pregnant, asthmatics, and others) needs to be considered. Although the use of other air-purifying respirators (ie, gas masks) for upwards of 2 hours by pregnant women in active labor without adverse effects on mother or fetus has been reported, 23 as has tolerance to EAPR use by controlled asthmatics over short periods of mild-to-moderate work activities, 24 data are scarce overall.

Comfort is an important determinant of compliance with the use of respiratory protective equipment. 8 In the current study, mean comfort scores with the EAPR were low (indicating less discomfort) and were not significantly different from controls at either work rate, suggesting that EAPRs are reasonably comfortable. Part of this comfort may be related to the low exertion work rates employed in this study, as supported by the fact that no significant differences were noted in the (low) mean exertion scores reported when comparing controls and EAPR use at either work rate. Furthermore, recent findings on HCWs respirator tolerance (a measure of comfort) reported that the same model of an EAPR as used in the current study was tolerated, on average, for 6.8 hours of use. 8 Nonetheless, numerous complaints were offered by the current study subjects regarding subjective symptoms and design features ( Table 3 ) that lend some credence to other recent findings that an EAPR, although tolerable, has a greater adverse subjective impact on wearers than N95 FFRs. 24 Moisture retention in respiratory protective equipment has been anecdotally suggested as a possible mechanism for increased respirator breathing resistance with prolonged use because of trapping of moisture in filter pores 4,25,26 but has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny of any significant degree. Although no significant differences in moisture retention were noted at the 2 work rates (P 5 .72), we did not perform airway pressure measurements and cannot comment on any physiological effect of the moisture retention. We observed that there was significant moisture on the inner surface of the EAPR, including the exhalation valve, no doubt related to the relatively nonporous nature of the materials.

Limitations of the current study include the relatively small sample size (n 5 10). There are many differences between this model and the many EAPRs available on the market with respect to materials (eg, silicone, rubber, plastic), price, size, weight, tethering device configuration, filters and performance so that we are unable to generalize our findings to other EAPRs. The study subjects had no prior experience with an EAPR, and that could have negatively impacted performance, but this may be a more plausible study group given that most HCWs have not had experience with EAPRs. 6 The use of RIP for ventilation data is subject to intra-and interpersonal variability 19 and is not as reliable as standard laboratory monitoring equipment (eg, spirometer, pneumotachygraph), but refinements in RIP have led to improved accuracy in recent exercise studies. 27, 28 Similarly, transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels are not as precise as arterial measurements, but improvements in sensors have led to greater precision, 29, 30 and this technique is not discomforting to the subject and avoids needle puncture-associated complications. Last, the current study was not carried out in a health care facility; however, laboratory studies have been suggested as actually representing the upper boundary of study parameter measurements. 24 

Compared with controls over the course of 1 hour at 2 work rates associated with the health care environment, EAPR use by HCWs results in a lower breathing rate and compensatory higher tidal volume. Absolute increases in transcutanous carbon dioxide levels over control values were not statistically significant over the course of 1 hour and not associated with symptomatology of hypercapnia, but variable retention of carbon dioxide occurred in a significant proportion of subjects and is a cause for concern. This will have to be evaluated further in a larger study and over more prolonged periods of continuous use. Subjective ratings indicated that, although an EAPR was tolerable over 1 hour and not associated with significant perceptions of exertion, comfort was negatively impacted.

Protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome: filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks,"Guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation state that healthcare workers should wear N95 masks or higher-level protection during all contact with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In areas where N95 masks are not available, multiple layers of surgical masks have been tried to prevent transmission of SARS. The in vivo filtration capacity of a single surgical mask is known to be poor. However, the filtration capacity of a combination of masks is unknown.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious, potentially life-threatening condition that frequently affects healthcare workers caring for infected patients. 1 The exact mode of transmission is unknown but may involve airborne as well as respiratory droplet and fomite spread. In view of the possibility of airborne transmission, current guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) state that healthcare workers should wear N95 masks or higher-level protection during all contact with suspected SARS patients. These masks are expensive and not necessarily easily available in poorer countries. In some areas, multiple layers of surgical masks have been tried to prevent SARS transmission.

The filtration capacity of a single surgical mask is known to be poor. 2 It is not known whether this improves when more than one mask is worn simultaneously.

This was a prospective unblinded study of six healthy volunteers using combinations of one, two, three or five surgical masks (Surgikos, Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, TX, USA). The Surgikos mask is a pleated rectangular three-ply mask with a bacterial filtration efficiency of 95% at 3 mm. All volunteers gave written informed consent. Approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

All six volunteers underwent a set of tests with each of the combinations of masks. These involved standard testing procedures using a protocol described previously. 3 In brief, the tests consisted of comparisons of particle counts inside and outside the masks during a series of activities: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning the head from side to side, flexing and extending the head, talking loudly, and bending over followed by normal breathing again. The tube for sampling the mask particle count was connected to a test probe that was inserted through the fabric of the protective device. The probes were provided by TSI (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, MI, USA) for this purpose. The design of the probe is such that there is no leak around the insertion point, so the efficiency of the mask at filtering ambient particles should remain unchanged. The insertion site was centrally in the area directly in front of the mouth, as per the instructions for use provided by TSI. The tube for sampling the ambient particle count was fixed approximately 3 cm from the sampling probe.

A PortaCount Plus (TSI Incorporated) connected to a computer running FitPlus for Windows software (TSI Incorporated) was used to count particles and calculate the ratio of ambient to device particle counts. This device counts all particles with a diameter between 0.02 and 1 mm. It calculates a fit factor, which is the average ratio of atmospheric to device particle concentrations. The equation used is:

where N is the number of exercises performed and ff j is the fit factor for the individual exercise. One modification was made to the PortaCount Plus. The re-usable tubing supplied by the manufacturer was replaced with disposable PVC tubing of the same internal diameter and length to minimize any risk of cross-infection. To ensure an adequate ambient particle count throughout the testing, the 8026 Particle Generator (TSI Incorporated) was used to generate saline particles throughout the testing procedures. Each surgical mask was tied separately.

The American National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health requirements for a half mask respirator are that it should have an assigned protection factor of 10. 4 Further to this, a safety factor of 10 is required when conducting performance or fit testing, so a half face respirator should achieve a minimum fit factor of 100.

Data obtained while wearing one mask were compared with data obtained while wearing five masks using a paired t-test (Statview 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A P value !0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results of the filtration capacity of the devices are shown in Figure 1 . The median reduction in particle count for a single surgical mask was 2.7. This increased to 5.5 with five surgical masks. The difference in particle count reduction in a given subject between one and five surgical masks ranged from 1.6 to 4.2. The best particle count reduction with five surgical masks was 13.7 times, which is less than the required value of 100 for a half face respirator.

Our data confirm previous findings that the filtration of submicron-sized airborne particles by a single surgical mask is minimal. The ratio of the concentration of particles inside the mask to the concentration in ambient air was only 2.7. Although greater filtration was afforded by multiple masks, with an approximate doubling in the filtration factor when five masks were worn compared with a single mask, the absolute filtration factor remained low and well below the minimum fit factor of 100 required for a respirator. For this reason, even multiple masks are not a suitable alternative to N95 masks when the latter are available.

The more difficult question to answer is whether the use of multiple masks provides significant, albeit suboptimal, protection against infection with SARS Co-V. This is likely to depend on the route of transmission of SARS Co-V, the viral load required to cause infection and the degree of viral shedding by the patients.

Surgical masks are designed to prevent the wearer from transmitting infection to others, but do provide some protection against respiratory droplet and fomite spread. If SARS Co-V is not transmitted by airborne particles but only by respiratory droplets and fomites, even one surgical mask is likely to protect the user to a significant degree. If the virus is spread by airborne transmission, the likelihood that surgical masks will provide significant protection is dependent on the viral load required to cause infection and the degree of viral shedding by the patient(s). If the number of viruses required to produce clinically significant infection is low and large numbers of viruses are shed by patients, it is unlikely that even multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. If, however, large numbers of viruses are required and small numbers are shed, it is more likely that multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. Unfortunately, those data are not available, although an epidemiological study has suggested that SARS is only moderately infectious. 5 Data from a recent retrospective multiple logistic regression study suggest that surgical masks may afford significant protection against SARS. This study showed that wearing either a N95 mask or a surgical mask reduced the risk of contracting SARS with little difference in risk reduction. 6 These data must be treated with considerable caution for two reasons. Firstly, the authors took no account of the degree of exposure of the wearers to high-risk situations. It is likely that staff exposed to high-risk situations would be more likely to wear a N95 mask, while those only exposed to low-risk situations would be more likely to wear a surgical mask. Without controlling for this confounding factor, it is not reasonable to compare the two types of mask. Secondly, the number of staff who contracted SARS was too small to allow meaningful multiple logistic regression analysis.

One limitation of the study is that the Portacount measures dust particles of less than 1 mm in size rather than SARS CoV. If SARS CoV is carried on larger particles, it is possible that the masks may provide better protection than our results suggest. On the other hand, surgical instruments are known to produce submicron-sized particles that carry viable viral particles. 7 Furthermore, a study has shown that particles of up to 22 mm in size enter the respiratory zone when these masks are worn. 8 In conclusion, our data show that no combination of multiple surgical masks was able to meet the requirements for a respirator. If protection against airborne organisms is required, an N95 respirator or better should be used, as currently recommended by the CDC and WHO guidelines for SARS prevention. Multiple surgical masks will reduce the number of viruses inhaled, but whether the degree of reduction is sufficient to produce significant protection is unknown and cannot be predicted at present. Multiple surgical masks should, therefore, only be used if N95 masks are not available.

Review of economic evaluations of mask and respirator use for protection against respiratory infection transmission,"Background: There has been increasing debate surrounding mask and respirator interventions to control respiratory infection transmission in both healthcare and community settings. As decision makers are considering the recommendations they should evaluate how to provide the most efficient protection strategies with minimum costs. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. Methods: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. Results: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. Conclusions: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.","Both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines recommend the use of a mask in low-risk settings and a respirator in high-risk settings (e.g. during aerosol generating procedures) to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from seasonal influenza [1, 2] . The use of a respirator at all times is also advised for HCWs caring for patients with suspected infectious tuberculosis [3, 4] . These measures are important to protect HCWs as well as to reduce the spread of respiratory infections within hospitals. This can help to reduce both the costs associated with HCW absenteeism and the costs of nosocomial infections.

Mask/respirator availability may also prove crucial in the context of newly emerging respiratory infections, particularly as some diseases such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) may initially have no vaccine or treatment available, leaving nonpharmaceutical measures as the only available protection for HCWs. For other diseases such as pandemic influenza, reliance on vaccines for protection is not always possible due to time delays in vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution [5] . Furthermore, the stockpiling of relatively expensive antivirals for influenza pandemics may not be cost-effective in low and middle income settings [6] .

In the absence of standardised mask/respirator nomenclature [7] , we will use the term 'mask' to indicate standard surgical masks, also referred to as ""medical masks"" in some countries. These are not specially engineered to protect the wearer from aerosol transmission of droplet nuclei and viral particles [8, 9] . 'Respirator' will be used to denote all personal protective facemasks engineered for filtration and fit to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses and aerosol droplets. Several air purifying respirators that filter the inhaled air through filtering materials are available for use by HCWs [10] , these include: N95, HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air), PARP (powered air purifying respirator), DM (dust-mist) and DMF (dust-mist-fume).

There are substantial differences in cost between different mask/respirator options. These cost differences may be an important determinant in the development of country specific mask/respirator guidelines for HCWs. For example, the more costly PARP is only recommended in the guidelines for high income countries [7] . Many countries' guidelines recommend fit testing and training sessions for respirator use, but contain limited descriptions of what this should entail [7] . Fit testing can be qualitative or quantitative, with the latter being more expensive and adding a substantial cost to respirator use but not to mask use, which does not require fit testing [10] .

Two studies evaluating mask/respirator use [11, 12] were included in a previous economic review of influenza pandemic measures [13] . There are a small but growing number of economic evaluations for masks/respirators. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate this existing literature and offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted.

The Scopus database was searched for all Englishlanguage literature on the economic evaluation of mask or respirator use for the control of respiratory infection transmission. Scopus includes 100 % coverage of both MEDLINE and EMBASE [14] . The majority of the relevant literature identified in the initial Scopus search included influenza or tuberculosis as either the single focus or one of the diseases to control. For this reason, these terms (influenza OR tuberculosis) were used in addition to the generic terms related to infection and transmission, i.e. they did not prevent the identification of articles focused on other infectious respiratory diseases. The final search strategy contained publications until the 1st of August 2014, and used the search terms (as keyword, title or abstract): 'facemask*' (or 'mask*' or 'respirator' or 'N95' or 'non$pharm*' or '{personal protect*}') AND 'economic*' (or 'cost*') AND 'infect*' (or 'transmi*' or 'influenza' or 'tuberculosis').

The 806 results from this initial Scopus search were screened (Fig. 1) . The abstracts of these articles were reviewed on the basis of whether they were economic evaluations (e.g. cost-effectiveness, cost-utility or costbenefit studies), and whether the intervention being evaluated involved masks and/or respirators as a strategy to prevent the transmission of respiratory infections. From this process, 112 full text articles were considered potentially relevant and their full texts were further reviewed for eligibility. Of these, only six were confirmed to be economic evaluations of mask or respirator infection control interventions. One additional study by Dan et al. [12] was identified from the reference list of a systematic review [13] . These were the main studies used in our qualitative synthesis. Four other costing studies [15] [16] [17] [18] have been published but these examined the cost of the intervention only and were not classified as full economic evaluations (i.e. they did not examine the health impacts or the cost savings from prevented illness). Data from the included studies was independently extracted intro a spread sheet by SM and this was reviewed by ATN. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between these authors.

Seven economic evaluations of mask/respirator use in the control of respiratory infections were identified (Table 1) [11, 12, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . These studies varied widely in their settings and methodologies. The studies by Adal et al. [19] and Nettleman et al. [23] were published in 1994 and were on tuberculosis in healthcare settings. Five others (published post 2008) were focused on seasonal or pandemic influenza [11, 12, [20] [21] [22] . One of these by Dan et al. [12] also considered a SARS scenario. Other than this study, to date, no other mask/respirator economic evaluations have been identified that focus on SARS, MERS-CoV or other respiratory viruses (other than influenza). There were also no economic evaluation studies identified on mask or respirator use to prevent transmission of Ebola.

The interventions evaluated by the studies included N95 respirators [12, 20, 22] , HEPA, DM and DMF respirators [19, 23] , and surgical masks [19] [20] [21] 23] . Amongst the studies that focused on influenza, two of the five, by Dan et al. [12] and Chen and Liao [21] , integrated mask/respirator use in a scenario in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical control measures e.g. natural ventilation [21] or isolation measures [12] , as opposed to evaluating the use of masks/respirators exclusively. This makes it difficult to assess to what degree the mask/respirator aspect of the intervention is driving the cost-effectiveness, or if the results are more attributable to the other control measures included.

The settings of the evaluated studies varied more broadly for the influenza studies than for those on tuberculosis. Three of the five influenza studies were in a community setting [11, 20, 22] . Of the others, one considered control measures for both the community and hospital setting [12] and the last was set in a primary school [21] . All of the seven identified studies were set in the USA or other developed countries, limiting the generalisability of the findings, e.g. for decision making in low resource settings. The lack of studies in low resource settings has been cited as one of the major impediments to the use of cost-effectiveness analysis for pandemic influenza preparedness planning in this context [24] .

Four of the five influenza studies included the number of infection cases as one of the outcome measures of intervention effectiveness (Table 1) [11, 12, 21, 22] . The remaining influenza study quantified and reported the consequences of infection on other outcomes e.g. prevented deaths, hospitalisations, outpatient visits and absenteeism [20] .

Both tuberculosis studies measured conversion rates of newly positive protein derivative tests in HCWs at study hospitals [19, 23] . A positive test indicates a 5-10 % chance that the individual will develop active tuberculosis in their lifetime [25] . One of the two studies also estimated the number of patients isolated for known tuberculosis per month, confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis cases in patients in the past year and active cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in HCWs in the last 5 years [23] . This additional information provided a more complete measure of the impact of the intervention.

Only three [12, 19, 23] of the seven studies reported results as cost per unit of effect. The evaluation by Dan et al. [12] of influenza and SARS reported an incremental cost per death averted [12] . The other two were the tuberculosis studies, with one reporting the cost to prevent a single occupational case of tuberculosis in the next 41 years [19] and the other reporting the cost per tuberculosis case prevented and the cost per life saved [23] . Two of the pandemic influenza studies evaluating combinations of interventions in the community concluded that mask/respirator interventions were cost saving in a pandemic setting [11, 22] . The first estimated substantial net savings if 10 % of the population had worn N95 respirators during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, assuming an effectiveness of 20 % [11] . The second estimated that surgical mask use at 60 % compliance would yield savings of $US100-250 million, far exceeding the estimated intervention cost of $US20 million [20] . The influenza modelling studies by Jones and Adida [22] focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the methods rather than reporting key economic results. The influenza study by Chen and Liao [21] calculated a cost per individual to implement control measures, but limited the inclusion of costs to intervention and outpatient treatments costs.

Approaches to incorporate intervention effectiveness amongst the seven studies varied ( Table 1 ). Both of the tuberculosis evaluations by Adal et al. [19] and Nettleman et al. [23] reported that no efficacy studies were available and thus no specific measures of mask or respirator effectiveness were included in their evaluations. Nettleman et al. [23] assumed that in a best case scenario, HEPA respirators would prevent 25 % of HCW exposure to tuberculosis, but no data was cited to support this estimate. Adal et al. [19] implicitly assumed that all HCW cases of tuberculosis that may have been acquired from patients in isolation with active tuberculosis would be prevented by the intervention.

Of the five influenza studies, Tracht et al. [11] was the only study that attempted to utilise clinical efficacy data. They obtained this from a randomised trial in a university residence setting [26] that found a significant decrease (35-51 %) in influenza-like illness if hand hygiene and medical masks were used together compared to a control, but no difference for medical mask use alone. Tracht et al. [11] uses this result to estimate N95 respirator use provides a 50 % decrease in susceptibility to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. This may not be robust as the clinical trial measured different outcomes (i.e. influenzalike illness, not influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases) and it assumes there is no difference between the efficacy of medical masks and N95 respirators based on the findings of Loeb et al. [27] , although other trials have found evidence that there is a difference [28] . The study by Jones and Adida [22] derived efficacy estimates from the assigned protective factor (APF) measure for N95 respirators released by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [29] . The APF is estimated from laboratory testing completed by this organisation, including laboratory testing of the quantitative measure of fit when the respirators are fit tested to ensure a protective seal around the wearer's face. Cahill et al. [20] also used efficacy estimates from laboratory investigation data [30] . These estimates may have limited applicability to measuring real-world effectiveness [31] . Dan et al. [12] estimated baseline intervention effectiveness rates of 50, 80 and 90 % as protective equipment (including masks) and isolation precautions were increased. They did not cite data to support these estimates, however a 5 % failure rate where transmission still occurs despite the use of protective equipment and isolation measures, was obtained from a hospital simulation study [32] . Chen and Liao [21] applied a relative efficacy estimate of masks in combination with other control measures which was developed in a previous modelling study that did not cite supporting data for efficacy input assumptions [33] . Other than Tracht et al. [11] , none of the analyses used intervention effectiveness estimates from clinical trials such as the mask/respirator randomised trials that have been published to date on interventions in community and healthcare settings [26] [27] [28] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .

Only two of the seven evaluations, by Dan et al. [12] and Jones and Adida et al. [22] , explicitly stated the economic perspective from which they had conducted their evaluation, these being a policy developer view [22] and the healthcare institution perspective [12] . On the basis of costs included and excluded, four of the seven studies are most aligned with healthcare payer perspectives [12, 19, 21, 23] and the remaining three with a societal perspective [11, 20, 22] (e.g. they included some form of productivity costs). Both tuberculosis evaluations by Adal et al. [19] and Nettleman et al. [23] , considered costs from a healthcare provider perspective, reflecting the objective of preventing the burden of nosocomial cases in HCWs and patients. The influenza studies [11, 20, 22] more frequently applied a societal perspective, consistent with the substantial economic impact of productivity losses due to influenza absenteeism [39] .

The reporting of costs included in the evaluations was often not transparent. One evaluation by Dan et al. [12] identified the omission of the indirect costs of lost revenue from the cancellation of elective surgeries, decreased outpatient attendance, lost clinical teaching time and administration costs of senior staff meetings. These costs were not discussed in other influenza modelling studies where they may have been relevant [11, 20, 22] . The tuberculosis studies by Adal et al. [19] and Nettleman et al. [23] relied on hospital databases for the number of masks/respirators used, and multiplied this by unit costs to calculate total costs. Administration costs were most thoroughly reported in the tuberculosis study by Adal et al. [19] , which included staff program planning time and staff medical evaluation time.

All of the studies that estimated a cost per case, included the cost of infected individuals [11, 12, [20] [21] [22] . For example, one influenza modelling study by Jones and Adida [22] assumed a fixed average cost for each infection. This may not always be an ideal method to cost resources used as the cost of an average case may vary amongst patients [40] . Tracht et al. [11] allocated a separate average hospital cost per day due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections for three age groups.

Three of the studies evaluating the intervention in the community included the impact of compliance [11, 20, 22] . These included simple approaches, as used by Cahill et al. [20] of assessing 60 and 100 % adherence scenarios, as well as by Jones and Adida [22] where an estimate of 50 % compliance was assumed. Tracht et al. [11] conducted a more thorough sensitivity analysis by dividing the population into three age groups and testing three scenarios with different proportions of compliance in each group. No study attempted to use compliance rates from real-world investigations such as clinical trials [28, 36] .

There were a relatively small number of economic evaluations of mask/respirator use that met the inclusion criteria and no existing studies were found that address the costeffectiveness of these interventions in low-middle income countries. The seven evaluations identified have limited utility to advise decision makers on the value for money that masks and respirators offer compared with other health spending choices. This is due to the reporting of results in the form of intermediate outcomes (e.g. case prevented) and the analysis of combinations of masks/ respirators with other protection measures in evaluations [12, 21, 22] . There was also limited inclusion of clinical data to inform the effectiveness estimates and the impact of intervention compliance in the identified studies. Compliance has major implications for a mask/respirator intervention targeting HCWs [9] . For example, obtaining high adherence in HCWs has not been feasible in some high-income countries such as Australia [41] . Variation in HCW mask/respirator compliance has been observed between countries, such as the lower rates seen in UK hospitals compared to Hong Kong and Singapore during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [42] . Mask/respirator adherence is primarily driven by perceived susceptibility to the infectious disease threats present [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .

What clinical evidence is there on comparative mask and respirator effectiveness?

Only one of the reviewed studies [11] cited clinical evidence to support their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. However, there is a growing body of research in this area. An initial systematic review on the topic reported pooled efficacy measures from case control studies for N95 respirators and medical masks of 91 and 68 % respectively for the prevention of respiratory viruses [49] . A weakness of this initial review was that the case control studies included in the metaanalysis focused exclusively on SARS [50] . As a consequence, it should not be assumed that the conclusions of this meta-analysis are necessarily true for influenza or other respiratory infections [51] .

The updated edition of this review concluded that there was no evidence of a significant difference in effectiveness between N95 respirators and medical masks [50] . However, this conclusion was heavily influenced by a single cluster randomised trial by Loeb et al. [27] that compared N95 respirators and medical masks, both used selectively in high-risk situations. This trial contained only 446 HCWs and may have been underpowered to detect a difference between the arms [28] . Two larger trials not included in this review have been published [28, 36] . One of these by Macintyre et al. [28] , involving 1669 HCWs, found significantly greater protective efficacy for continuous N95 use when compared to continuous medical mask use, but no evidence that selective N95 use was superior to continuous medical mask use for the prevention of clinical respiratory illness [28] .

The limitations of the review include the restriction to English language articles used in the search of the Scopus database. Further potential limitations are that the identification and screening process was carried out predominantly by one of the authors (SM). Finally, the limited number of studies identified for inclusion made it difficult to make general conclusions about costeffectiveness.

One key recommendation is that future economic analyses should attempt to apply clinical mask/respirator efficacy data, preferably from clinical trials, where this data is deemed applicable to the infectious agent, intervention and setting, rather than using estimations derived from expert opinion or laboratory testing studies [31] . In some cases this may not be possible, for example, it is not appropriate to extrapolate clinical trial results for respiratory viruses to tuberculosis and for ethical reasons, randomised trial data cannot be collected on the effectiveness of a respirator intervention in HCWs for tuberculosis prevention. While the use of other types of efficacy data applied in the studies identified by this review have limitations, the results of the studies may still have validity. However, the underlying assumptions made in the analyses do need to be carefully considered.

Although economic evaluations have been conducted for the use of mask/respirator strategies in HCWs for tuberculosis, the way these evaluations should be used to inform policy needs to be carefully considered. Costeffectiveness criteria should only be one part of the decision making process for any intervention and there may be specific cases where this factor should be given less weight. Economic evaluations would be of less relevance to a decision maker in situations and settings where a respirator would be used regardless of its cost-effectiveness, but they may be more useful in evaluating situations where these devices are not currently recommended in a given setting.

Future evaluations should report their results in such a way that would allow them to be easily compared to other non-pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained). If an evaluation fails to report results in an appropriate format, this limits its use for decision making as it means that the value of mask/respirator interventions cannot be compared with spending on healthcare interventions targeted at other diseases [40] . However, in some cases the use of intermediate outcomes (e.g. cases prevented) can still be useful for comparing alternative ways of reducing specific infection events. This may provide useful information to decision makers.

Future analysts may also want to consider whether masks/respirators are cost-effective for use by HCWs in the seasonal influenza context, or if they are only costeffective in extreme pandemic scenarios which may necessitate a stockpiled supply of masks/respirators.

Although the WHO and the CDC recommend that HCWs use masks for low-risk influenza exposure and respirators for high-risk influenza or tuberculosis exposure [1] [2] [3] [4] , there is currently a lack of economic evidence to support these recommendations. Further robust economic evaluations on mask/respirator interventions are needed.

The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT): a cluster- randomized comparison of respirator and medical mask effectiveness against respiratory infections in healthcare personnel,"Background: Although N95 filtering facepiece respirators and medical masks are commonly used for protection against respiratory infections in healthcare settings, more clinical evidence is needed to understand the optimal settings and exposure circumstances for healthcare personnel to use these devices. A lack of clinically germane research has led to equivocal, and occasionally conflicting, healthcare respiratory protection recommendations from public health organizations, professional societies, and experts. Methods: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple U.S. study sites. Healthcare personnel who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators or medical masks for protection against infections during respiratory virus season. Outcome measures will include laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections, acute respiratory illness, and influenza-like illness. Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored by the study team.","Healthcare personnel (HCP) are exposed to respiratory pathogens in many clinical settings [1] . Infected HCP may spread infection to their patients [2] [3] [4] [5] or coworkers [3] [4] [5] [6] , to family members [4, 7] , or to other community members [4, 8] . Respiratory viral infections among healthcare workers can negatively impact delivery of healthcare services [9] [10] [11] .

United States national guidelines call for modes of transmission to dictate infection control measures [3] . For most human respiratory viruses, the precise mode(s) of person-to-person transmission is incompletely understood [12, 13] . The predominant mode of transmission for some human respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus is believed to be droplet transmission. Airborne transmission plays a role with some human respiratory pathogens via small aerosol particles, often called droplet nuclei [3] . Airborne transmission is the predominant mode of transmission for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3, 14] and recent evidence has suggested a larger role than previously thought for Influenza A and B viruses [15, 16] .

Disposable respiratory protective devices (RPD) that fit tightly to the wearer's face, sometimes called airpurifying respirators or filtering facepiece respirators, are primarily designed to protect the wearer against infection spread by ill patients. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly known as ""N95 respirators"") are one type of RPD capable, with proper facial fit and usage, of reducing inhalation of airborne particulates by a factor of 10 or greater [17] . Medical masks (MM), typically called surgical masks in operative settings, are primarily devised to protect patients against infection spread by the wearer [18] . Both types of devices also serve as a physical barrier keeping sprays and splashes of infectious materials and contaminated hands and objects away from oronasal region of wearer. Although RPD and MM are capable of filtering particulates [19] , RPD are designed to filter smaller particulates that may remain airborne for long periods. A tight seal between the respirator and the wearer's face is designed to prevent leakage of particulates, a feature not provided by loose-fitting MM. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to ensure each HCP, who may be exposed to airbornetransmissible infections in the workplace, receives an RPD with an adequate respirator-to-face seal that is determined during a mandated annual ""fit-test"".

However, evidence is inconclusive that RPD are better than MM at protecting HCPs from respiratory infections in clinical settings [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , despite tight-fitting RPD produced by manufacturers, with higher levels of exposure reduction validated by numerous laboratory studies [19, [26] [27] [28] , and the use of a complete respiratory protection program (e.g., training, initial and annual fit test) as defined by OSHA to protect HCP. Intuitively, RPD should better protect HCP against airborne infections than MM, but objective evidence has not validated this supposition. One possibility that may explain this discrepancy between expectations and observations is pragmatic: HCP, in general, do not tolerate N95 respirators as well as medical masks [29, 30] , perhaps prompting them to remove respirators more frequently and/or for longer periods, increasing the likelihood of exposure to infections. Models have shown that 25 % or more non-wear time during exposure negates any significant differences in protective ability between types of RPDs [17, 31] . Given the difficulty with HCP adherence to guidelines [4] and general dissatisfaction [4, [32] [33] [34] with RPD, medical masks worn more consistently may provide similar levels of reduction in respiratory viral disease transmission as N95 respirators.

This key gap in knowledge has contributed to discrepant clinical and public health recommendations about respiratory protection for HCP [35, 36] . Needed are additional well-designed clinical trials conducted in patientcare settings during outbreaks of respiratory infections. The following is an abridged version of the full research protocol for the Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT).

To compare the effectiveness of N95 respirators and medical masks at protecting HCP from acquiring viral respiratory illnesses in the workplace.

Null Hypothesis: The incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza (primary), influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory illness (ARI) and other respiratory infections will not be different between HCPs who practice 2007 guidelines (medical masks) or 2009 guidelines (N95 respirators).

Alternative Hypothesis: The incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza (primary), influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory illness (ARI) and other respiratory infections will be different between HCPs who practice the CDC's 2007 guidelines for influenza protection (medical masks) versus 2009 guidelines for influenza protection (N95 respirators).

ResPECT is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple, geographically distributed U.S. study sites. HCP who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators [37] or MM [38] for protection against infections during respiratory virus season, the ""intervention"" period.

The null hypothesis assumes N95 and MM intervention groups will have no differences in outcomes, including (1) laboratory confirmed influenza or (2) influenza-like illness (ILI), (3) acute respiratory illness (ARI), and (4) laboratory confirmed respiratory illness (LCRI). The alternative hypothesis asserts the incidence of at least one outcome would be different between intervention groups.

Because respiratory virus season varies year-to-year in onset, severity, and duration, multiple season-years of the study will be necessary to account for expected variance and optimally generalize the resulting knowledge. The beginning of each season's data collection will be independently determined for each study site using an epidemiologic predictive tool designed for ResPECT to capture the largest possible number of respiratory infections. These data will be collected for twelve weeks each season.

Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be measured by the study team at each site. Since periodic changes in infection control guidance and practice may occur over the study years, participants will be expected to adhere to the most up-to-date guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local policies at each study institution, at a minimum. For example, a participant randomized to the MM arm will be expected to don an N95 when participating in an aerosol-generating procedure, assuming no further changes in pertinent national guidance [39] .

The study participants will be recruited from outpatient settings where patients are relatively likely to present with symptoms and signs of acute respiratory infection. Participants will be eligible to enroll for multiple study seasons, yet each will be provided with informed consent and complete enrollment procedures prior to each study season.

Clinical Study sites will be distributed geographically: 

Participants will be cluster-randomized to one of the following N95 respirators or MM models, selected because they are commonly used in U.S. medical facilities, including the ResPECT study sites. Participants who participate in more than one of the study years will be cluster-randomized anew each year. N95 Respirators: 

(1) Precept 15320 or (2) Kimberly Clark Technol Fluidshield 47107.

All subjects participating in the study will be required to pass an OSHA-accepted respirator fit test for the N95 respirator model(s) available at the study site. No fit testing of medical masks will be performed as these devices are not designed to be tight-fitting to the face and studies [19, 20] have shown that their fit capabilities are generally low.

Filter Performance Although medical masks are loose-fitting, they create a physical barrier that helps prevent splashes and sprays from reaching the wearer's mucous membranes. In addition to passage around the mask, some of the small particle aerosols are able to pass through the mask's filter media. Therefore, in addition to RPDs, filtration testing was done on medical masks prior to enrollment of subjects to ensure consistency between models across study locations. The filtration performance of the N95 respirators and medical mask models in the study were tested in a manner similar to that used by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Devices were attached to a test fixture and placed in a TSI 8130 automated filter tester operated with an air flow rate of 85 liters per minute. The TSI 8130 uses a photometer to measure the flux of light scattering from aerosol particles. Polydispersed particles (mass median diameter of~0.3 microns) were generated from a 2 % NaCl solution and passed through each device being tested for 1 min. Each test was repeated 3 times with a fresh N95 respirator or medical mask. To be certified as an N95 respirator, filter penetration needs to be less than 5 % (or 95 % efficient). As shown in Table 1 , the average penetration percentages for the NIOSH certified N95 respirators were an order of magnitude lower than those of medical masks, which are not NIOSH certified. Filter results between N95 respirator models and between medical mask models were comparable.

Filter airflow resistance was measured simultaneously using the TSI 8130. As filter airflow resistance increases, more energy expenditure is required for ventilation during device wear and the greater potential for perception of discomfort [40] . The medical mask models selected for this study have filter airflow resistance levels about half of that of the N95 respirators. However, one study [40] found that subjective and physiological responses were not different among subjects exercising while wearing devices purposely made with different filter airflow resistance levels (3 mm H 2 O, 6 mm H 2 O, and 9 mm H 2 O) in the range similar to those of the devices in this study (Table 1) .

Participants will be instructed to don a new N95/MM with each patient interaction, every time a participant encounter occurs within 6 feet of a patient who has suspected or confirmed respiratory infection. Hand hygiene will be recommended to all participants in accordance with CDC guidelines [41] and policies at each study institution. Trained research assistants will observe participants during study periods to assess adherence to their assigned intervention arms and hand hygiene. A portable computer equipped with data recording software (HandyAudit; Toronto, Canada) will be used to document adherence. Participants will be expected to complete surveys about their attitudes and opinions concerning personal protective equipment before and after each seasonal study period.

During the twelve week data collection period each year, participants will self-document (a) perceived occupational exposures to patients or coworkers who have symptoms or signs of respiratory infection, (b) perceived 

Anterior nasal and pharyngeal swabs [42] [43] [44] [45] [FLOQSwabs UTM (99-08024), Diagnostic Hybrids; Athens, OH] will be collected by research assistants when symptomatic with study defined respiratory symptoms, as well as two, randomized asymptomatic swabs during each seasonal study period. Swabs will be collected when (a) participants self-report respiratory symptoms within a 24 h period, and again if participants remain symptomatic after 7 days; and (b) randomly, on all participants, twice during the active intervention period. The Primary Outcome Measures will be the incidence of:

Laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) A or B infection in participants, defined as a) detection of influenza virus by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an upper respiratory specimen swab collected within seven days of symptom onset, or b) influenza seroconversion defined as at least a 4-fold rise in hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HAI) titers to influenza A or B virus from the pre-to post-season serological samples that is not deemed attributable to vaccine.

The Secondary Outcome Measures will be the incidence of:

(1) Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) defined as the occurrence of one sign or two symptoms ( The incidence rate ratios between participants randomly assigned to wear N95 respirators or medical masks will be estimated for each of the primary and secondary outcomes.

Investigators will be paired and provided with blinded information about clinical and laboratory data to determine if a participant meets a primary or secondary outcome. If the paired investigators do not agree, a principal investigator will adjudicate the outcome.

Assays will be performed at Johns Hopkins University.

Collected respiratory specimens will be stored at −80°C until analyzed using multiplex PCR (PLEX-ID, Abbott Labs, Chicago IL). Automated extraction of nucleic acid (NA) from respiratory specimens will be performed utilizing NorDiag's Arrow instrument and the Magna Pure robotic system (Roche Indianapolis, IN) per manufacturer instructions. Each extraction run will include a quality control (NATrol Respiratory Validation Panel 3, Zeptometrix Inc., Buffalo NY); runs with control failures will be repeated. Purified NA will be amplified via RT-PCR using a broad respiratory virus identification kit (PLEX-ID RVS 3.0, Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). Desalting of RT-PCR product and electrospray mass spectrometry-based NA analysis will be performed on the PLEX-ID analyzer instrument. If funding is sufficient, samples will also be assayed by RT-PCR for Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and for Chlamydophila pneumoniae. 

Each study season, blood samples will be collected twice from each participant; one sample will be collected within two weeks of the beginning of the intervention period and a second within two weeks of the end of the intervention period. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody assays will be performed on serum for influenza A and B virus strains, dependent on the antigens in each annual trivalent vaccine using standard methods [46, 47] . In brief, serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples will be incubated with 8 hemagglutinin units of influenza antigen and a turkey red blood cell suspension. The serum HAI antibody titer will be defined as the dilution factor of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibits agglutination of turkey red blood cells in the presence of type-specific hemagglutinin antigen. Assays will be performed at the immunology core lab for the study at the VA Saint Louis Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.

To optimize compliance and generalizability, a clusterrandomized design will be utilized. All participants working in the same clinical unit will be assigned to wear the same respiratory protective equipment (i.e., an N95 or MM) during patient interactions for the entire 12 week seasonal study period. Clusters will be pairmatched within each study site based on the characteristics of each clinical cluster, including the (a) number of participants (b) occupational location, such as an emergency department, urgent care or primary care, (c) patient population served, such as children or adults, and (d) requirements for participants to wear additional protective equipment, such as goggles donned by dental hygienists. For each study season, the clinics in each matched pair will be randomly assigned to opposing study arms. For matched pairs participating in multiple study seasons, random sequences of arm assignments will ensure each is assigned to both study arms during the multi-year study. Each study season, an individual not involved in the study implementation and data analyses will perform the randomization scheme for each study site, using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel. The principal investigators will be blinded to the randomization scheme prior to assignment.

Incidence rates of LCI, ARI, ILI, and LCRI among cluster-randomized participants will be compared. The relationships between incidence of clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed illnesses will be analyzed with attention to potential confounders, such as participants' demographics, study arm compliance, attitudes and opinions about infection control, receipt of influenza vaccination, and infectious exposures within and beyond the workplace. Standard statistics will describe baseline characteristics and follow-up measures, summarized by treatment arm and stratified by study site.

To assess the primary outcome, a logistic regression model will be fit using a dichotomous variable to indicate whether a participant became infected with a respiratory pathogen. The odds of infection between the two treatment groups will be reported with a 95 % confidence interval. For secondary outcomes, Poisson loglinear mixed effects regression models will assess the difference in seasonal respiratory infection rates between intervention groups. Cluster-and individual-level random effects will be considered to account for clustered observations. Additional covariates may be added to the models to adjust for confounding.

Participants will be encouraged to complete the study. Those who withdraw from an intervention arm will be encouraged to complete follow-up laboratory specimen collection. An intent-to-treat analysis, in which all available data on all randomized participants are included, will be used for the primary comparison of interventions. A per-protocol secondary analysis will compare treatment effectiveness, accompanied by a planned sensitivity analysis that accounts for participants from whom researchers were not able to obtain a second serological sample. 

To detect a 25 % reduction (i.e., a relative risk of 0.75) in the incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza or laboratory confirmed respiratory illness among participants wearing an N95 respirator, compared to participants wearing a medical mask, ResPECT will need to accumulate approximately 10,024 or 5104 personseasons of data over four seasons respectively.

Sample size calculations are based on several assumptions about the incidence rate and levels of withincluster correlation. The attack rate laboratory-confirmed influenza during a single study season is assumed to be 20 % among unvaccinated individuals in the medical mask group. We assume 65 % of our population will be administered a vaccine that is 65 % effective in preventing influenza infection. Vaccine effectiveness at the higher end of published reports (86 % in health care workers) will lead to a reduction in the yearly attack rate to approximately 8.8 %, and effectiveness at the lower end of published reports (51 % in the general population) would lead to an increased yearly attack rate of approximately 13.4 %. Importantly, the anticipated effect on the needed sample size of annual variations in influenza incidence is larger than the expected impact of variation in vaccine effectiveness.

The ResPECT study will need 157 independent clusters with a median size of 16 participants each to achieve 80 % power to detect a relative risk of 0.75 between N95 and surgical masks at preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, with a Type-I error rate of 0.05. The total number of individuals participating each season will need to be approximately 2506, with 10,024 total person-seasons accumulating over the multi-year study. For the secondary outcome of laboratory confirmed respiratory illness, the estimated total number of clinics will need to be 80, the total number of individuals participating each season will need to be 1276, and total person-seasons accumulated need to be 5104 (Table 4) over the multi-year study. The sample size are made using the clusterPower software package for R [48] .

Power is estimated using an expected annual attack rate of 12 % {12 % = 0.35*0.2 + 0.65*(1-0.65)*0.2} [13] . This yearly attack rate translates into a 4-year attack rate of 39 % {39 % = 1-(1-(0.35*0.2 + 0.65*0.35*0.2)) 4 . Accounting for correlation of outcomes within clusters by assuming the correlation coefficient is 0.1, leads to a design effect of 2.5.

For scenarios representing the lower and higher ends of anticipated attack rates in the medical mask group, two quantities were calculated (a) the power to detect a relative-risk of 0.75 between the N95 group and the medical mask group and (b) the relative-risk that can be detected with 80 % power (Table 5 ). For all of these calculations the two-sided Type I error probability is 0.05.

Potential outcome analysis for laboratory-confirmed influenza Some data on the primary outcome may be missing due to participants withdrawing from the study early and missing the second serological sample. To account for the unavoidable uncertainty posed by missing primary outcome data, due to participant withdrawal or loss of follow-up, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted that randomly assigns binary outcomes to participants who did not complete the study. A two-dimensional grid will be created that varies the influenza attack rates among participants who withdraw. Withdrawal attack rates in both arms will be fixed between half and twice the observed attack rates, based on complete data. By varying these two parameters across the grid, and for each combination, the adjusted odds ratio will be calculated by averaging across n = 50 imputed datasets for each point on the grid.

Analysis of differential withdrawal The characteristics at the time of randomization for participants without complete follow-up will be examined. To assess the potential biases introduced by differential withdrawal among different N95 respirators, a comparison of withdrawal rates and time to withdrawal will be included as an ancillary analysis to the analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes.

ResPECT will be approved by the institutional review board at each participating study site and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prior to study initiation. (An unabridged version of the ResPECT protocol was approved by the intitutional review board at each study site and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 

Viral respiratory infections cause a wide range of illnesses, varying from mild to severe, in HCPs who may spread infection to their patients, family members, and other community members. Healthcare-associated infections cost $10B annually in U.S [49] . Factors influencing transmission of respiratory infections in healthcare facilities include the population density of ill patients in healthcare settings, the types of exposures within healthcare settings, the administrative and physical structures of healthcare facilities, and intrinsic characteristics of virulence [3] . Measures to prevent transmission within healthcare facilities include HCP vaccination, handhygiene, cleaning and disinfection of inanimate surfaces, pre-and post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, patient isolation, and personal protective equipment [3, 6] .

ResPECT is designed to better understand the extent to which PPE, specifically represented by differences in exposure reduction afforded by N95s and MMs, reduces clinical illness among HCPs.

While it may seem that N95 respirators should better protect HCPs than MM against airborne infections in the workplace, this notion has not been validated by objective clinical evidence. Low tolerance to respirator wear among HCPs may prompt more frequent or longer periods of removal, compared to MM, to an extent that the benefits of higher levels of filtration and lower levels of leakage around the facial seal afforded by respirators is offset or subjugated.

Key sources of variability in HCP health outcomes are difficult to control for, even in a rigorously designed clinical study such as ResPECT. For example, the inability to prevent HCP community exposures to respiratory infections and the inherent year-to-year variation of viral respiratory infections provide a challenging setting in which to evaluate the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. While community-acquired infections may pose a significant source of exposure for HCPs, this type of exposure, if occurring non-differentially between study arms, would bias the results from ResPECT towards the null hypothesis.

Key reasons for choosing a cluster-randomized design are (a) to increase compliance by equipping all members of a healthcare team with the same equipment and (b) to capture indirect effects of the intervention at the cluster-level, such as herd immunity [50] .

A fully successful study would produce clinically relevant results that help clinician-leaders make reasoned decisions about protection of HCPs against occupationally acquired respiratory infections and prevention of spread within healthcare systems.
