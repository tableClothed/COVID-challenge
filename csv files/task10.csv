The International Health Regulations: The Governing Framework for Global Health Security,"r The International Health Regulations (IHR) are the governing framework for global health security yet require textual and operational reforms to remain effective, particularly as parallel initiatives are developed.","The IHR's origins can be traced to a series of Sanitary Conferences beginning in 1851 to forge an international agreement to curb the spread of infectious diseases (originally cholera, followed by plague and yellow fever) entering Europe from Asia, particularly India and the Levant. 10 At that time, the concept of global health security meant protecting Europe without unduly hindering trade. The Sanitary Conferences led to a binding agreement in 1892-the International Sanitary Convention (ISC)-focused on quarantine for cholera. European states subsequently adopted additional conventions, which were incorporated into a single ISC. By 1926, the ISC covered primarily cholera, yellow fever, and plague. The raison d'être of the earliest treaties grew out of a perceived security imperative for powerful countries. Most important was selfprotection against external threats, rather than safeguarding the public's health in every region of the world.

In 1907, the Rome Agreement created the Office International d'Hygiène Publique (OIHP), entrusting this new agency with overseeing the international health agreements. 11 At its creation in 1948, the WHO assumed OIHP's mandate and oversight of the ISC as well as a separate convention on air travel. The WHO Constitution empowered the Organization to adopt regulations to prevent the international spread of disease (Articles 21, 22) . Its power to adopt regulations is far-reaching-binding on Member States unless they affirmatively opt out. 12 In 1951, the WHA exercised this authority to replace the ISC with the International Sanitary Regulations (ISR), covering 6 diseases. In 1969, the WHA revised the ISR, changed their name to the International Health Regulations, and removed typhus and relapsing fever. The WHA removed smallpox in 1981 after its global eradication. By the time the WHA called for fundamental revision of the IHR in 1995, the treaty applied to the same 3 diseases as the original ISC-cholera, plague, and yellow fever-and no others. hemorrhagic fever, it became clear that the IHR were insufficiently flexible to respond to new infectious disease threats. The WHA called for the IHR's revision in 1995, and subsequent resolutions in 2001 and 2002 brought critical attention to the early detection of, and rapid response to, public health threats; yet the WHA took little action to shore up the obvious weaknesses in the IHR. [13] [14] [15] The imperative for global health governance took on fresh urgency with the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although SARS cases emerged in November 2002, China delayed notifying the WHO until February 2003. China took 2 additional months before permitting WHO epidemiologists to enter Guangdong province, where the outbreak originated. Later, Beijing conceded it had experienced hundreds more cases than previously reported. 16 Then WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland criticized China's delays, 17 catalyzing a major political shift toward a global norm of transparency and prompt reporting, further driving IHR reform. 18 The WHA adopted the revised IHR in 2005, with the treaty entering into force in 2007. Currently, the IHR have 196 States Parties-every WHO Member plus Lichtenstein and the Holy See. 19 

The revised IHR aim ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease"" (Article 2). The IHR broke from a disease-specific model, embracing an ""all-hazards"" strategy. They define ""disease"" to include all illnesses or medical conditions, irrespective of origin or source, that could present significant harm to humans (Article 1). The drafters intended to incorporate biological, chemical, and radio-nuclear events, as well as zoonotic diseases and threats to food safety.

Recognizing the importance of travel and commerce, the IHR contain a ""balancing dynamic,"" comprising public health, commerce and human rights (Figure 1 ). This balance informs the health measures a State Party may take for international travelers upon their arrival and departure (eg, medical examinations, vaccinations, observation) and for keeping ships and aircraft free of contamination and disease vectors. States Parties must, though, have sufficient scientific evidence of the risk posed and of whether the measure adopted is likely to ameliorate that risk before taking restrictive travel or trade measures or impinging The IHR obligate States Parties to develop core capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern. The IHR (Annex 1) prescribe explicit capacities for surveillance and response and for controlling and containing disease at points of entry. The IHR identify minimum core capacities required at the local, intermediate (regional/provincial), and national levels to detect unexpected morbidity and mortality, report essential information, confirm and assess the status of reported events, notify the WHO when required (following the decision algorithm in Annex 2), and respond effectively to contain and mitigate the event.

To guide States Parties in developing IHR core capacities, the WHO published the IHR Core Capacity Monitoring Framework in 2010 (subsequently updated). 20 The IHR Monitoring Framework and accompanying IHR Monitoring Tool identified 8 specific core capacities, as well as 5 other capacities concerning points of entry and specific hazards ( Figure 2 ). For each of these 13 core capacities, the WHO identified attributes and actions, asking states to use these attributes to assess their compliance.

The concept of core capacities embraced an ""upstream"" public health strategy to prevent and contain outbreaks at their source. States Parties agreed ""to collaborate with each other to the extent possible"" to develop and maintain core capacities (Article 44). States Parties were required to develop and maintain core capacities by 2012, with a possible extension to 2014, and an additional extension to 2016. In 2015, the 68 th WHA extended the deadline to 2016 for all 81 States Parties that had requested extensions. The WHA also decided to support 60 priority countries, including those in west and central Africa, to meet core capacities by June 2019 3 ( Figure 3 ). Still, the Organization's pattern has been to accept continual delays in State Party compliance.

In line with their historical origins, the IHR contain rules regarding points of entry at ground, air, and water borders, as well as health measures for conveyances, goods, containers, and travelers. Further, States Parties must apply health measures in a nondiscriminatory manner, justify additional measures, collaborate with other states, and treat personal data confidentially. States Parties must report to the WHO on their IHR implementation and comply with prescribed dispute resolution procedures. Importantly, the IHR also set up new mechanisms for twoway communication and information sharing between the WHO and States Parties. The IHR mandate that each State Party appoint a National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for routine information sharing and coordination during health crises. All states have NFPs, at least on paper, but many NFPs either are not well trained in IHR implementation or-more often-are not properly tasked to routinely communicate with WHO headquarters.

The IHR require States Parties to promptly notify the WHO of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) with an ongoing obligation to inform and respond to follow-up requests ( Figure 4 ). Notifications alert the world to unfolding public health events as well as marshal resources and coordinate global response efforts. To guide notifications, Annex 2 contains a decision instrument requiring States Parties to always notify the WHO of 4 specific diseases: smallpox, wild poliomyelitis, novel human influenza, and SARS. The algorithm also lists pandemic-prone diseases that trigger further assessment, including cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Beyond listed diseases, States Parties must utilize the instrument to assess any event of potential international public health concern, including from unknown causes, to determine if it is unusual or unexpected, may cross boarders, or may require travel or trade restrictions (Annex 2). Departing from previous international norms, the IHR authorize the WHO to consider reports from unofficial sources, such as scientists, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), print and broadcasting outlets, and social media platforms. When it receives an unofficial report, the WHO seeks verification from the States Parties in whose territory the event occurs. The director-general (D-G) has sole power to declare a PHEIC. In determining whether to declare a PHEIC, the D-G shall consider: (a) information provided by the State Party; (b) the decision instrument; (c) the advice of the Emergency Committee, which the D-G also has sole discretion to convene; (d) scientific principles and evidence; and (e) a risk assessment regarding human health, international spread, and interference with international traffic. If the D-G declares a PHEIC, she must issue temporary, nonbinding recommendations describing health measures States Parties should take. She is also empowered to terminate a PHEIC, which automatically expires after 3 months unless extended, modified, or terminated earlier.

Declared PHEICs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic put the IHR to the test. The WHO declared the first-ever PHEIC after consultation with Mexico and the United States. 21 The WHO, however, was later criticized for fueling public fear when it became clear the virus was not highly pathogenic (although it still caused more than 200,000 deaths worldwide), 22 but that criticism was primarily aimed at WHO's then definition of the pandemic influenza phases, which stood outside the IHR framework. Many States Parties also disregarded the WHO's temporary recommendations against travel and trade restrictions; several states banned pork imports, while others instituted travel restrictions and advisories. 23, 24 In 2011, the WHO Review Committee charged with reviewing IHR functioning during the H1N1 pandemic cautioned, ""The world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic . . . with tens of millions at risk of dying."" 25 In 2014, the D-G declared 2 further PHEICs, for polio and for Ebola. The designation of polio appeared counterintuitive given there was only a handful of cases. Yet small pockets of polio in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria were putting global eradication at risk. The following year, the WHA endorsed extension of the PHEIC given political instability in the regions with ongoing outbreaks. 26 The polio PHEIC declaration is untraditional, appearing more to rally political support in targeted states than to alert the world to any large-scale reemergence of the disease.

In the case of Ebola, the D-G waited 4 months after announcing an ""unprecedented outbreak"" in April 2014 before declaring a PHEIC on August 8, 2014. 27 The delay only looked worse with time, as leaked WHO documents revealed that the WHO's decisions were highly political and lacked transparency. 28 The WHO's Ebola Interim Assessment Panel in July 2015 said that urgent warnings ""either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance."" 2 The Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola wrote, ""Confidence in the organization's capacity to lead is at an alltime low."" 4 The temporary recommendations also suffered major flaws of their own, asking states with limited infrastructure to ensure health system capacities without adequate international assistance. 29 The Ebola PHEIC declaration, though, ultimately rallied the international community to bring the epidemic under control, but not before it had claimed more than 11,300 lives. 30 Most notably, President Obama sent in military assets to build treatment facilities and provide logistical support; the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted a historic resolution calling Ebola a threat to international peace and stability; and the UN Secretary-General created a UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). Although the D-G continued the PHEIC on December 18, 2015, human-to-human transmission has virtually ended in the 3 most affected countries. This robust, albeit delayed, response demonstrates that political resolve and ample financing can bring seemingly intractable health threats under control.

On February 1, 2016, the D-G declared the fourth, and most recent, declaration of a PHEIC in response to the Zika epidemic. 31, 32 Since Brazil reported Zika in May 2015, an estimated 1 million infections have occurred across 25 countries in the Americas. IHR NFPs throughout the Americas have been reporting laboratoryconfirmed cases of Zika to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which has issued recommendations for the region. 33 Most concerning is a possible association between Zika virus and neurological disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS]) or fetal abnormalities (microcephaly). Curbing the Zika epidemic will require effective vector control, mosquito and human surveillance, and research for reliable diagnostic tests and a vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika-affected countries. Women who are considering becoming pregnant should talk with their doctor. 34 This is the first time the D-G has declared a PHEIC for a mosquitoborne disease, but the scope of the declaration was narrower than for other PHEICs. Dr. Margaret Chan said, ""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."" 35, 36 In other words, the PHEIC was for the cluster of microcephaly and GBS rather than for the Zika virus itself. From a legal perspective, the wording of the PHEIC introduces confusion as neither microcephaly nor GBS is an infectious disease. These neurological and congenital conditions per se do not appear to be hazards that could cross borders under the meaning of Annex 2. It is the Zika virus itself and the mosquito vector that have the potential for international transmission.

Undeclared and Potential PHEICs. The world is now closely watching outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which originated in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS has yet to trigger a PHEIC declaration despite its reaching more than two dozen countries and accounting for at least 1,621 laboratory-confirmed cases and 584 deaths as of December 2015. 37, 38 By September 2015, the D-G had convened 10 Emergency Committee meetings, 39 with the last two occurring during and after the spread of the virus from Saudi Arabia to the Republic of Korea, which sparked a large outbreak. 40 The Emergency Committee recommended careful monitoring and strengthened infection prevention and control. Most MERS cases were linked to hospital settings, and in the absence of sustained community transmission, the Committee concluded the conditions to declare a PHEIC had not been met. 41 For many global health crises, the D-G chose not even to convene an Emergency Committee, including cholera in Haiti, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and chemical weapons use in Syria. Each event would have required notification under Annex 2, in addition to the several hundred events that have been reported to the WHO as potential PHEICs. Confusion still exists as to what events warrant consideration by an Emergency Committee and a potential PHEIC declaration. What steps can and should the WHO take to ensure prompt notification and information sharing, and how can the D-G improve the transparency and scientific rigor for declaring a PHEIC?

The IHR afford a vital governing framework to limit the international spread of disease. Yet, 10 years of experience has shed light on the critical challenges in implementing the IHR, as well as major omissions in the regulations. These challenges and gaps have become politically salient, with deepening concern that the IHR, and the WHO itself, have failed to fulfill the promises of sound governance and leadership. The past decade has revealed an urgent need to improve the IHR's text, but failure to effectively implement the regulations has become far more important. States Parties, in particular, have undermined the IHR's effectiveness by failing to fully comply with their international obligations. Below, we explain the gaps and features of noncompliance that have undermined the IHR's operational viability.

National core capacities for preparedness, detection, and response form the bedrock of global health security. 42 Yet most States Parties have yet to fully establish core capacities. In 2014, only 64 States Parties reported meeting core capacities, while 48 failed even to respond to the WHO 43(p6) ( Figure 5 ). Governments have not properly funded and implemented required capacities, while international assistance has been limited. 43(p6) Achieving IHR core capacities by all states remains an indisputable baseline for global health security. The more time it takes to detect an event, the slower the response is and the more lives are lost. Every WHO IHR Review Committee and all the major commissions ( Table 1 ) have demanded that States Parties build and strengthen core capacities-all to little avail. 2,43(p12,13) Finding the resources to support health system capacity building has been challenging. While States Parties committed to providing domestic resources to build core capacities, national budgets often neglect this fundamental commitment under the IHR. Many countries with limited resources have had little bandwidth to prioritize building systems for unknown threats as they have struggled to meet the everyday health needs of their populations-ranging from primary care and essential medicines to safe childbirth and healthy mothers and babies. Similarly, the WHO and higher-income States Parties agreed to provide technical and financial assistance to countries in need (Article 44), but with some exceptions, 44,45 very few have funded projects explicitly for building IHR core capacities. The bulwark of international financing has been in the form of vertical funding streams, such as for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. All in all, sustainable funding commensurate with the need for IHR core capacities has come neither from national governments nor from donors.

Through the IHR Monitoring Tool, the WHO expects States Parties to conduct annual self-assessments on IHR implementation, focusing on the 13 core capacities. States were supposed to issue formal reports in 2012 (with additional reports in 2014 and 2016 for governments that requested extensions) to declare if they had fully implemented the regulations. If not, countries were supposed to submit a concrete plan to reach full implementation. Even if all States Parties had reported accurately and in a timely manner, national self-assessments are unacceptable and cannot ensure uniformly high-quality national preparedness. States Parties have not collected sufficient or the right kinds of data to produce quantitative assessments of what are predominately qualitative questions. Governments, moreover, do not use a consistent set of evidence-based metrics to measure their compliance. Most importantly, self-assessments are inherently self-interested and unreliable, absent rigorous independent validation. These deficiencies undermine the integrity and utility of self-assessments. 43(p6) Beyond the failure of political will, country assessments have not been directly linked to robust technical and financial assistance. Lowerincome states, perhaps understandably, express reluctance to upgrade their capacities without such assistance. Overall, responsibility for fulfilling core capacities must be a shared one, requiring dedicated domestic budgets, international financing, and WHO leadership. And absent these political and financial commitments to build core capacities, the world is considerably less secure.

Although the IHR call for robust information sharing through reporting of potential PHEICs and subsequent requests for follow-up data, countries continue to delay notifications and/or limit the information reported. Delayed reporting and/or lack of transparency and cooperation, for example, occurred in West Africa during Ebola and in Saudi Arabia during MERS. Additionally, governments have failed to share pertinent information about international travelers, either out of defiance of their international obligations or simply due to confusion about patient privacy-all despite guidance under Article 45.

The extant governance framework reveals an inherent tension, providing a disincentive to transparency and information sharing. The IHR cannot effectively govern global health security unless governments promptly report novel infections. This follows the simple pattern of the epidemiologic curve: the faster health authorities know about a novel event, the faster they can mount an effective response, leading to fewer cases ( Figure 6 ). But governments have economic reasons to withhold or delay transparent information sharing. They fear that once they have disclosed an outbreak of a novel infection, other governments and private parties may impose travel and trade restrictions, with severe economic consequences. For example, once they have disclosed, the IHR Emergency Committee could conclude that travel and trade restrictions are warranted; or, more likely, governments or the private sector may simply take action, disregarding WHO recommendations. The adverse economic impact of early reporting under the IHR can dissuade States Parties from being fully transparent.

Given previous patterns, national concern about the economic repercussions of prompt reporting appears fully justified. Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, for example, experienced aggregate cumulative losses over 10% of GDP due to the Ebola outbreak. 46 Canada during SARS as well as Mexico and the United States during H1N1 suffered major losses from precipitous reductions in tourism and trade. Yet, the failure [and] that have the potential for such catastrophic economic impact."" The Commission estimates that a pandemic in the 21 st century could cost in excess of US$6 trillion. 5 Despite the severe health and economic repercussions of unnecessary travel and trade restrictions, the WHO has not had the political authority or capacity to prevent States Parties from disregarding its recommendations. The WHO is not a policing agency, and the IHR offer scant inducements to ensure consistent State Party compliance. When countries balance their IHR obligation to report against the risk of economic sanctions, they may wait as long as possible before sharing vital information.

The Ebola epidemic highlighted major deficiencies in mobilizing a large-scale, coordinated response to health emergencies. The IHR provide a framework for global health security, but that framework functions only if the WHO is an effective leader and governments build strong health systems. The WHO erred at multiple levels during the Ebola epidemic. The D-G waited 5 months after cross-border spread before declaring an emergency. The WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and country offices impeded deployment of international aid workers and equipment. Most importantly, the WHO failed to mobilize adequate fiscal and human resources until the epidemic was spinning out of control. The Organization eventually corrected these mistakes, but its errors probably cost thousands of lives. The fault lies, in fairness, not only with the WHO Secretariat but also with Member States that have starved the agency of resources for many years.

The reasons for the WHO's failures are well understood but remain resistant to change. In 2011, the agency cut its budget by nearly US$600 million due to a severe fiscal deficit, notably its epidemic response capabilities. 47 Its regional structures have also been longstanding problems, with major variability in regional organizations. The D-G has called on governments and donors to build core capacities and has asked for State Party compliance with the IHR, but without impact. 48 All the Ebola commissions have exhibited an implicit distrust in the Organization to make the necessary reforms. Instead, each panel has proposed a well-funded and accountable WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola, for example, insisted that a new center be quasi-independent, with a separate governing board ( Table 2) .

The WHO is the agency charged with overseeing the IHR. Without effective leadership, the IHR's security framework breaks down. In other words, a strong treaty text is insufficient without a well-funded and robust operational response.

When the revised IHR were negotiated, Member States aimed to be as inclusive of all public health threats as possible. However, there remained major omissions in the text, notably sample sharing and zoonotic threats. The secretary-general should initiate the integration of health and humanitarian crises trigger systems.

The WHO should establish a transparent and politically protected Standing Emergency Committee. 

Indonesia sent shock waves around the world in December 2006, when its minister for health, Siti Fadilah Supari, refused to share samples of avian influenza A (H5N1) with the WHO. Indonesia's decision revealed fissures within the international community. Developing countries backed Indonesia's claim that it was unfair to require sharing viruses without any reciprocal obligation to make vaccines and medicines affordable. The WHO led a 5-year negotiation resulting in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework. 49 The PIP Framework, however, applies only to pandemic influenza, and not to other novel pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and Zika. The PIP Framework stands entirely outside the IHR. The regulations, furthermore, are mostly silent on the health security issues of sharing biological materials and genetic sequencing data (GSD), as well as equitable access to medical countermeasures. Article 6(2) of the IHR, however, does offer some guidance for information sharing, stating that States Parties shall continue to provide relevant public health information to the WHO following a potential PHEIC notification, including case definitions, laboratory results, source and type of risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting spread, and the health measures that have been deployed. There is no explicit mention of sharing biological materials or GSD, even though one could broadly interpret Article 6(2) to encompass these data. Certainly, biological materials and GSD are pertinent public health information that would shed light on the conditions affecting the spread of disease.

Neither the IHR nor the PIP framework, moreover, addresses a modern biosecurity hazard. In the not-too-distant future, scientists will be able to sequence the genetic composition of pathogens, enabling them to re-create novel viruses and to manipulate their genetic makeup. Although, for example, smallpox has been eradicated, scientists can sequence its genome, synthesize a real smallpox virus using the genetic code, and potentially enhance the virus's ability for airborne transmission. These capabilities pose major biosecurity threats, which the IHR and the PIP Framework do not govern. Harmonizing the IHR and the PIP Framework and closing major coverage gaps would markedly improve health security.

Approximately 70% of all emerging infectious diseases have a zoological origin, yet negotiators intentionally did not explicitly include animal diseases in the IHR. The drafters were perhaps too deferential to existing regimes, such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Although the IHR broadly define ""disease,"" its currently realized scope is narrow, and the regulations do not incorporate a ""One Health"" approach that fully integrates animal and human health systems. The lack of such an approach could become a particularly salient omission for diseases like Zika with large animal reservoirs and with the primary mode of transmission through an insect source.

The IHR Monitoring Framework seeks to include zoonotic diseases as ""other hazards,"" but the regulations fail to govern multisectoral engagement and coordination on zoonotic diseases or the laboratory and surveillance capacities required to identify disease in animals. As the world faces the peril of novel zoonotic diseases and the overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals (exacerbating the global antimicrobial-resistance crisis), it appears anomalous that the IHR do not facilitate and guide research and practice at the intersection of human and animal health.

The IHR are the governing framework for global health security, yet they require textual and operational reforms. The WHO Secretariat is engaged in an internal reform process, ranging from the WHO Roadmap for Action on Ebola 3 to the Advisory Group on Reform of WHO's Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies with Health and Humanitarian Consequences. 50 In addition to the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, 2 the agency established the WHO Review Committee on the Role of the IHR in the Ebola Outbreak and Response. 51 On January 30, 2016, the D-G announced internal reforms, including a single program and incident management strategy to oversee all health emergencies. The D-G stressed, however, yet again, that the program required sustainable funding from Member States. 52 The proliferation of internal and external reform processes could be transformative. This is ""the defining moment for the health of the global community."" 2 Yet, it is just as likely that the maze of recommendations will lead to weak or muddled reforms. In the sections that follow we offer proposals for fundamental reform of IHR implementation, WHO oversight, and State Party conformance (Table 3) . We propose politically feasible pathways to reform to avoid a long history of bureaucratic stagnation. Thus, our proposals balance the ideal with the politically possible.

Meeting IHR core capacities requires mutual responsibility and accountability. It starts with governments dedicating resources to build and sustain health systems. Every State Party should undergo independent, rigorous review of its implementation of IHR core capacities, using measurable metrics and targets, as explained below. Shared responsibilities also require technical assistance and international financing to close capacity gaps. Collective security is assured only by fulfilling these mutual obligations to sustainably build, measure, and finance health systems (Figure 7) .

Building sustainable core capacities requires fresh thinking by both donors and recipient countries. Too often, countries heavily dependent on external funding follow the priorities of donors, agreeing to erect vertical programs, stove-piped by disease. Yet, meeting IHR core capacities requires the development of horizontal programs, including diagnostic laboratories that can be used for more than just one pathogen or condition; specimen transport systems that are applicable to all samples; and event-based surveillance systems designed to pick up unusual or unexpected public health events. Building core capacity also requires integrating these systems into annual budgeting for health system strengthening.

For IHR metrics to be meaningful, valued, and utilized, they must undergo rigorous external evaluations. The WHO should establish an independent evaluation system with a feedback loop and continuous quality improvement. Independent assessments would use evidence-based metrics and indicators. Unless assessment criteria are clear, transparent, and valid, they will not be fully trusted. The measurable benchmarks for the external assessment process, moreover, should be integrated directly into Annex 1 of the IHR, which contains the core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. It may be necessary either to amend Annex 1 or to operationalize it to incorporate more granular indicators. 

Political Mechanism

Capacities Secure national and global commitment to build, strengthen, and maintain IHR core capacities linked directly to independent assessments and financing.

National governments, international organizations, bilateral donors, and funding organizations

Global health security is dependent on every nation having the ability to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies.

No textual change to IHR required for commitment to core capacities Political and financial commitment to support process required by the WHO and other funding entities, such as the World Bank and regional development banks Table 3 .

Independently Assessed Metrics Utilize rigorous metrics assessed by independent evaluators to identify capacity gaps, develop a road map, and identify funding sources to achieve core capacities.

Independent evaluation teams of domestic and external experts with the participation of the WHO, regional and country offices, and civil society

Independently assessed, vigorous metrics will provide accurate analysis of national core capacities that can then be used by funding entities to invest in core capacities or for use in insurance mechanisms.

Tasking the WHO to work with funding entities to create rigorous metrics and organize assessments Table 3 .

Political Mechanism

Harmonize independent assessments and metrics with the GHSA and the OIE's PVS Pathways.

The WHO in collaboration with the GHSA and the OIE Why:

Harmonization will ensure a One Health strategy and reduce redundancies for governments exposed to multiple evaluations. WHA understandings or addition of an annex to the IHR Parallel initiatives such as the GHSA and OIE's Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathways (measuring compliance with OIE standards on veterinary services) should be harmonized with the IHR. The IHR are the only agreement with the international legal and political legitimacy to set global security standards. Harmonizing extant multiple standards within the IHR would be more holistic, ensuring a One Health strategy and reducing redundancies for governments exposed to multiple evaluations.

States often resist external assessment due to sovereignty concerns, but the new system could be designed to foster cooperation. Evaluation teams would comprise both domestic and external experts, so national governments would be fully involved in the process. WHO, regional, and country offices would all play a strategic role. Civil society should be fully engaged, much like in UNAIDS monitoring mechanisms. Expert panels would work constructively and collaboratively to identify capacity gaps, develop a road map, and identify funding sources to achieve measurable benchmarks for success. The mandate, therefore, would not be to give a passing or failing grade but to continuously improve health infrastructure with strategic plans and adequate financing.

The World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Facility (PEF) should tie funding to country cooperation with IHR assessments. Additionally, international donors such as regional development banks, the Global Fund, and philanthropies could create funding streams for national IHR core capacities, also conditioned upon rigorous assessments. All of these measures would reinforce national commitments to build robust health systems, which align well with the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). 53 ""What gets measured gets done."" But Laud Boateng, a GHSA Next Generation Fellow from Ghana, shifts this discourse to better reflect national experiences noting, ""what gets measured gets done, but only what gets political support gets measured, and only that which is funded gets political support."" 54 Thus, tying independent evaluations to external funding would foster cooperation and marshal resources for building core capacities.

Robust financing is required not only to build national health systems but also to support the WHO's own capacities and to ensure a surge in resources in a health emergency. Several financing models could operate separately or in concert. Increasing WHO Member State-assessed contributions would be the most logical funding source. Mandatory dues are more predictable and sustainable than discretionary funding for targeted projects. Moreover, as the treaty oversight agency, the WHO holds the legal obligation to implement the regulations, including securing adequate financing.

Assessed dues, however, are politically fraught. Several high-income Member States do not have sufficient confidence in the agency to justify an increase in their dues. They also want the discretion to direct where their international assistance is going. Consequentially, it will be necessary to create alternative financing mechanisms. The GHSA Action Packages and the PEF are realistic funding sources, but they should be synchronized with the IHR. The Global Fund offers another model, whereby the WHO and the World Bank could host a donors' conference to boost international support and cooperation. 2, 55 Irrespective of the funding mechanism, ensuring sustainable resources to develop and maintain core capacities would benefit both low-and high-income countries by strengthening security for all.

Ebola demonstrated that a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce is crucial to an effective response, including doctors, nurses, community health workers, lab technicians, infection control practitioners, and public health experts. If there are insufficient health personnel and their numbers are depleted even further by exposure to infection, the health system will fail to control outbreaks. Educating, training, supporting, and protecting health workers is a defining issue for global health security.

Even a well-prepared workforce may not be able to cope in a public health emergency. In such cases, the WHO must make provision for a surge in human resources, such as through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The 2015 WHA endorsed a Global Health Reserve Workforce but failed to guarantee funding.

AIDS advocates demonstrated the power of civil society to demand global health equity. 56 Civil society organizations (CSOs) care for their communities, monitor governments, and hold stakeholders to account. As with other spheres of international law, such as in human rights or climate change, civil society could offer ""shadow"" reports and advocate for funding national capacities and fulfilling IHR and human rights obligations. Harnessing the power of CSOs requires more than incorporating them into existing or new IHR functions. Borrowing from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the WHO could regularly host a Conference of the Parties where civil society could meet with governments to advance IHR implementation. The Framework Convention Alliance (CSOs committed to effective implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) has propelled tobacco control reforms. A similar CSO network for IHR implementation could be transformative.

After facing criticism for disclosing Emergency Committee members only after the H1N1 PHEIC was terminated, the WHO improved public trust by releasing member names for subsequent Emergency and Review Committees. 25(p16) The WHO also pledged transparency on expert committee members' conflicts of interest. 57 Concerns still persist, however, that Emergency Committees are influenced by politics rather than strictly scientific evidence. For example, the D-G and Emergency Committee offered no evidence for their decisions regarding H1N1, 25 very little for the first Emergency Committee meeting on Ebola, 29 and little during the initial meetings on MERS. 58 They did give more transparent explanations for polio 59 and recent MERS and Zika Emergency Committees. 60 The D-G and Emergency Committee should routinely publicly disclose their evidence and decision-making processes. Transparency would include full minutes of Emergency Committee meetings, web access to relevant documents, and live updates through social media platforms.

Independent and transparent Emergency Committee decision making would build public confidence, but these reforms are of little value if the D-G fails to convene an Emergency Committee. Outside the WHO's governing structure and drawing on civil society shadow reports, a committee of independent experts, particularly from academia and civil society, could coalesce to regularly review data on disease outbreaks and propose actions, including recommending that the D-G convene an Emergency Committee.

The declaration of a PHEIC is the public face of the WHO's outbreak response, but the agency must respond long before an outbreak becomes an international emergency. Beyond the IHR, the WHO has multiple instruments supporting early action. For example, the WHO utilizes the Emergency Response Framework (ERF) to measure the level of risk and to inform the international community of an outbreak's severity in a graduated manner. 61 As evidenced during the Ebola epidemic, using 2 distinct sets of governing rules (the ERF and the IHR) confused first responders and the public. Similar confusion arose during the H1N1 pandemic, in which the WHO did not coordinate the 6 pandemic phases in the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Framework 62 (since revised) with the PHEIC. Given the public symbolism of a PHEIC, multiple emergency response frameworks must be integrated with IHR processes.

The WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel recommended introducing an intermediate-level emergency-allowing gradation while retaining the power of a PHEIC. 2 A gradient system would not necessarily require a textual amendment to the IHR, as many diplomats fear. The WHO could develop informal guidelines through Article 11, which allows the agency to share information with States Parties, alerting them to potential emergencies in a graduated fashion. Alternatively, the WHA could adopt a new IHR annex that illustrates the risk gradient, limiting negotiations only to the new annex. To maintain credibility, different grades should trigger clear operational and financial strategies. For example, an intermediate-level emergency could allow the WHO to access resources from the Contingency Fund. Similarly, the World Bank could release PEF funds based on graded emergency declarations by the WHO. 63 The promise of international assistance with adequate funding, even at an early stage, could provide additional incentives for States Parties to report a potential PHEIC through the Annex 2 algorithm. A full PHEIC declaration, however, would still be needed to raise the global alert, stiffen political resolve, and mobilize major resources.

State disregard for Article 43's ""Additional Health Measures"" and Emergency Committee temporary recommendations (eg, state travel and trade restrictions and injudicious quarantines) undermines the IHR. For example, during H1N1 and Ebola, States Parties ignored WHO recommendations and imposed additional measures, impeding deployment of critical medical supplies and health workers. Regional and international carriers suspended flights; States Parties banned travel to and from, or trade with, affected countries; and quarantines of health workers returning from the region dampened the charitable instinct to help.

The WHO is not a policing agency that can readily impose sanctions on States Parties for noncompliance with their legal obligations. But it does have various means at its disposal to enhance compliance, which it has failed to use. The D-G should publicly request clear rationales for and reconsideration of additional measures, while working with States Parties to dismantle harmful policies. The D-G could more actively encourage States Parties to pursue available dispute mediation and arbitration under Article 56 (3) . She could similarly steer States Parties toward the Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitrating Disputes Between Two States. The WHO and the World Trade Organization (WTO) could similarly encourage use of the WTO Dispute Resolution procedures by States Parties harmed by additional measures. Although the WTO is primarily constituted to adjudicate WTO treaties, it could intervene in cases where state action adversely impacts both public health and international trade-such as a poultry ban during H5N1 outbreaks.

Beyond the WTO, other institutions could encourage IHR compliance. For example, at various points during the H1N1 pandemic, the FAO, OIE, and WTO together with the WHO issued joint statements discouraging trade restrictions on pork and pigs. 64, 65 It may also be possible to look to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) when one country's active violation of the IHR causes specific damage to either the population or the economy of a second country.

There is still more the WHO could do to signal strong political commitment to IHR compliance. The WHA, for example, could amend Article 48 to elevate temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee during a PHEIC to a binding status. Even though States Parties could still disregard their international obligations, more binding treaty language could increase pressure to comply.

Textual reforms are more difficult to achieve than operational reforms. Reopening the full text of the IHR for revision would result in a multiyear negotiating process and require considerable resources and could weaken IHR norms and human rights safeguards. Our proposals for reform, therefore, should be achieved, whenever possible, by textual interpretation, understandings, and amendments to specific annexes, rather than the main text.

There is a precedent for amending an IHR annex without reopening the entire text to negotiation (2014 Resolution regarding Annex 7 and Yellow Fever). 66 States Parties could find consensus on new language or understandings focused only on particular annexes. Revisions to the main text through textual interpretations or understandings would be politically feasible. In arms control treaties, for example, States Parties use the mechanism of Review Conferences to agree on a series of understandings to guide treaty implementation and State Party compliance. The States Parties decide specifically not to reopen the original text to revision. IHR States Parties could adopt similarly effective political strategies, fully consistent with international law. ""Smart"" global health diplomacy could enhance IHR functioning without bureaucratic hurdles standing in the way of sensible reform.

Ten years after the adoption of the IHR, it is time to realize their promise. The unconscionable Ebola epidemic in West Africa opened a window of opportunity for fundamental reform-for both the IHR and the Organization that oversees the treaty. That political window, however, is rapidly closing. Donor fatigue, fading memories, and competing priorities (eg, climate change, the Paris bombings, and fighting the Islamic State) are diverting political attention. The promising results of the vaccine trial Ebolaça Suffit (""Ebola that's enough""), 67 although transformative, could further weaken political resolve. Empowering the WHO and realizing the IHR's potential would shore up global health security-a vital investment in human and animal health, while reducing the vast economic consequences of the next global health emergency.

Global Health and Foreign Policy,"Health has long been intertwined with the foreign policies of states. In recent years, however, global health issues have risen to the highest levels of international politics and have become accepted as legitimate issues in foreign policy. This elevated political priority is in many ways a welcome development for proponents of global health, and it has resulted in increased funding for and attention to select global health issues. However, there has been less examination of the tensions that characterize the relationship between global health and foreign policy and of the potential effects of linking global health efforts with the foreign-policy interests of states. In this paper, the authors review the relationship between global health and foreign policy by examining the roles of health across 4 major components of foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. For each of these aspects of foreign policy, the authors review current and historical issues and discuss how foreign-policy interests have aided or impeded global health efforts. The increasing relevance of global health to foreign policy holds both opportunities and dangers for global efforts to improve health.","Global health issues have long been a concern for foreignpolicy-makers. From sanitary cordons instituted to prevent plague from entering Croatia's Dalmatian Coast to the international sanitary conventions, which began in 1851, to the victories over malaria and yellow fever that permitted the construction of the strategic Panama Canal, health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreignpolicy interests. However, over the last 2 decades, globalization has made global health more relevant across multiple aspects of foreign policy than ever before. Fidler calls this a ''revolution'' in the political status of global health, noting that ''nothing in the prior history of national and international efforts on public health compares to the political status public health has reached today'' (1, p. 45) .

While the global health community has welcomed this elevated political priority, there has been less examination of why states incorporate global health into their foreignpolicy agendas or what interests states pursue when they engage on global health issues. These questions, and the broader issue of understanding the relationship between global health and foreign policy, are the subject of this review.

In an insightful examination of this subject, Fidler (2) suggests 3 possible interpretations of global health's rise onto foreign-policy agendas. The first interpretation argues that global health is an important objective of foreign policy in itself, and that ''health has become a preeminent political value for 21st century humanity'' (2, p. 183 ). This perspective concludes that global health can transform the state interests that have historically defined foreign policy. Echoing this position, Kickbusch et al. write that ''foreign policy is now being driven substantially by health'' (3, p. 971) , and Horton suggests that health can move ''foreign policy away from a debate about interests to one about global altruism'' (4, p. 807 ).

Fidler's second perspective views global health as ''merely a tool, an instrument of statecraft the value of which extends no farther than its utility in serving the material interests and capabilities of the state'' (2, p. 185) . Far from being transformational, global health is simply another issue that foreign-policy-makers weigh against other state interests. This perspective, based on the realist theory of international relations, explains the recent political prominence of global health as a result of the growing impact of disease upon traditional security concerns: ''When diseases threaten, or show the potential to threaten, national security, military capabilities, geopolitical or regional stability, national populations, economic power, and trade interests, foreign policy makers take notice'' (2, p. 184 ).

Fidler's final perspective sees the relationship between global health and foreign policy as an evolving dynamic between foreign-policy imperatives and the science of global health. This perspective does not discount that state interests drive foreign policy, but it recognizes that influence runs both ways, arguing: ''Scientific principles. . . channel action on health in specific directions that neither ideology nor power politics can alter'' (2, p. 186) .

In this article, we examine the available literature on global health and foreign policy for evidence supporting 1 or more of these theoretical perspectives. We review published articles organized around 4 key dimensions in the relationship between global health and foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. Use of these 4 dimensions, modified from Fidler's hierarchy of foreignpolicy governance functions (5), enables a detailed study of the relationship between global health and specific areas of foreign-policy practice.

A limitation of this paper is that stringent selection criteria for inclusion of published articles are not useful for addressing such interdisciplinary questions. An understanding of the relationship between global health and foreign policy benefits from examining papers across a broad range of public health, political science, and international relations literature and from incorporating case studies of interactions between global health and foreign policy that are difficult to target with search strategies. We conducted searches in numerous databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Social Science Citation Index, JSTOR, EconLit, and Science Direct), selecting articles that either directly addressed the relationship between global health and foreign policy or were case studies of an interaction between global health and 1 or more of the 4 dimensions of foreign policy. Thus, this paper is not a comprehensive assessment of every published article related to this subject; rather, we seek to provide a review of key existing literature that illuminates the relationship and tensions between global health and the aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security aspects of foreign policy.

States engage in development assistance (including development assistance for health) for multiple reasons and with differing levels of commitment, but there is typically an explicit or implicit recognition of the value of such assistance to countries' foreign-policy objectives (6, 7) . In 1961, when US President John F. Kennedy created the US Agency for International Development, he explicitly acknowledged the US security interest in providing aid to ward off the collapse of developing-country governments, which ''would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience'' (8) . The United States and other countries continue to frame development aid in a foreign-policy context by linking aid to national security and economic interests (9, 10) .

The foreign-policy rationale for aid has been clearly reflected in historical trends in development assistance. Since the end of World War II, large donor states have tended to focus bilateral and multilateral aid to support countries judged to be strategically linked to national security and economic interests (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The basic institutional architecture for multilateral development aid-the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations, along with specialized United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO)-were created after World War II with the immediate goal of rebuilding and modernizing war-damaged societies and safeguarding the security of Western powers (19) . Between the 1960s and the 1980s, aid from the United States and other Western countries ''reflected anti-communist Cold War tensions'' and focused on ''containing Soviet influence in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa'' (20, p. 2) . Promises of substantial US aid packages to Egypt and Israel facilitated their signing of the 1978 Camp David peace agreement, and since 1978 these 2 countries have ranked at the top of the list of recipients of US foreign assistance (21, 22) . The top 6 recipients of US aid in 2008 were (in descending order) Israel, Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Iraq, indicating a clear preference for aiding strategically important partners instead of the poorest states (20) .

Development assistance for health has generally followed the same trends as overall development assistance, but it is worthwhile to note 3 key, recent trends: the dramatic increase in funding, the growing number of actors and institutions, and the overwhelming focus on a single health condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (23, 24) .

According to 1 estimate, development assistance for health increased 4-fold from 1990 to 2007, from $5.6 billion to $21.8 billion per year, with more than half of this increase coming after 2000 (25) . This represents a change from previous decades, which were characterized by low, stagnant levels of health assistance (26) . This increasing volume of aid comes from and is funneled through an ever more complex set of actors: In a 2008 article, McColl (27) estimated that there are more than 40 bilateral donors, 26 United Nations agencies, 20 global and regional funding mechanisms, and 90 distinct initiatives involved in development assistance for health.

Efforts to fight HIV/AIDS received most of the increased development assistance for health. International resources for HIV/AIDS grew from a relatively paltry $292 million in 1996 to over $10 billion in 2007, quadrupling from 2001 to 2007 alone (28, 29) . While HIV/AIDS support drew just 5% of all development assistance for health in 1998, by 2007 it constituted 47% of all development assistance for health (30) . This trend is likely to continue: The Obama administration's proposed global health budget dedicates fully 70% of US official development assistance for health to HIV/ AIDS (31) . It is worth noting that while the growth in US development assistance for health increased an impressive 208% between 2001 and 2007, it was eclipsed by the growth in aid for government/civil society/democratization efforts (often highly linked to foreign-policy objectives), which grew 260% during the same period (32) .

Foreign policy links to development assistance for health trends Foreign-policy considerations underlie much of the remarkable growth in development assistance for health, from rising concerns about the national security and economic implications of health disparities to the perception of health assistance as an important ''soft power'' tool, to shifting domestic political perceptions of global health issues (33, 34) . In some cases, development assistance for health has been clearly and directly linked to national security. Since 2001, many donors have supported ''health security'' aid to reduce the threat of natural and intentional outbreaks of infectious diseases (35) (36) (37) . For example, aid for international influenza surveillance and pandemic planning and response programs was virtually nonexistent prior to the emergence the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but with the growing perception that an influenza pandemic presents a direct security threat (38) , more than $2 billion was provided to combat the disease between 2004 and 2008 (39) .

Other development assistance for health efforts is linked in a more indirect fashion to foreign policy and national security goals. Iraq, for example, received the greatest share of health-related development assistance of any country in the North Africa/Middle East region during 2002-2004, reflecting US and European interests in using health as part of its effort to foster a stable, pro-Western government there (40) . Still other development assistance for health programs has been justified on the basis of the relatively intangible benefits it provides, such as increased goodwill or trustbuilding. For instance, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has been touted as promoting positive views of the United States on the African continent (41, 42) .

Foreign-policy extensions of domestic political priorities have also shaped development assistance for health. Perlman and Roy observed that ''the orientation of [development assistance for health] had been heavily influenced by political changes in the United States and Great Britain'' (7, p. 14) . For example, during the conservative Thatcher (United Kingdom) and Reagan (United States) administrations, funding for family planning and social services was cut sharply to reflect these governments' priorities. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the largest bilateral health aid program ever, had origins rooted in US domestic politics, as President George W. Bush proposed the program partly in response to lobbying from his political base (43) .

The character and amount of development assistance for health has major implications for the health of populations in poor countries, because external donor support can comprise a large percentage of their health spending (28, 44) . This makes development assistance for health that is guided more by donor interests than by scientific evidence or the priorities of recipients a concern for global health proponents (45) . While there is some evidence of increasing correlation between development assistance and recipient countries' overall burdens of disease (25) , multiple studies demonstrate a continuing and significant disconnect between aid and the burden of health conditions, including maternal mortality (46) and malaria (47) , and the disability-adjusted life years measure (48) . However, even in cases where development assistance for health has been driven primarily by narrow foreign-policy concerns, health benefits can be realized; for example, US health aid for Egypt, an integral part of US Middle East policy, has helped the country achieve dramatic declines in child mortality (49) . Thus, foreign policy's powerful influence on development assistance for health leaves many pressing global health battles underresourced but allows global health efforts that do align with foreignpolicy interests to receive significant political support and funding.

The relationship between trade and health forms part of a long history of commercial exchange between human societies, dating from the 19th century BC through the extension of trade to India and China along the Silk Road and the expansion of trade by sea from the 15th century onward (50, 51) . As trade has evolved in geographic reach, scale, mode, and type of commodity, so too have the human health implications. Most directly, the coming together of human populations through trade can spread communicable diseases, and commodities exchanged also have the potential to harm (e.g., tobacco) or promote (e.g., fruits and vegetables) health.

Since 1945, the world trading system has expanded rapidly. Built on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) signed in 1947 and expanded through the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the world trading system has grown from 23 member states to 153. Today, the World Trade Organization oversees the implementation of more than 20 trade agreements covering a vast range of trade matters, including agriculture, trade in services, and trade-related intellectual property rights. There is also a growing number of regional and bilateral trade agreements (52) . With this growth has come tensions in the trade-and-health relationship due to frequent conflict between economic interests and global health goals (53) . Here, we examine these tensions by reviewing trends in trade in health-related goods and services and the broader effects that traded goods and services can have on health and disease.

Trade in health-related goods, such as pharmaceutical agents, medicinal products, biologic agents, and medical or surgical equipment and appliances, has grown rapidly since the 1990s, notably in the Americas (54) . While the GATT sets out rules to facilitate the trade of health-related goods, notably through tariff reductions and nondiscriminatory treatment, health-related goods are recognized as requiring specific provisions given the need for stringent quality standards. Insufficient regulation of blood products, for example, led to the inadvertent trade-facilitated transmission of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C (55) .

Another key issue in the trade of health-related goods is the health impact of standardizing patent rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Given concerns that patent-protected drugs would be too expensive for the world's poor, the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (known as the Doha Declaration) affirmed in 2001 the right of World Trade Organization member states to interpret and implement TRIPS in a manner that supports public health and, in particular, access to medicines (as permitted under GATT Article XX[b]) (56) . A clarification in 2003 specified when countries can import drugs produced elsewhere under a mechanism known as ''compulsory licensing'' (57) . Despite the World Trade Organization's claim that the Doha Declaration removed the ''final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports'' (58, p. 1), the limited capacity of developing states to actually implement the available flexibilities, especially given the stricter protections found in many bilateral and regional trade agreements (known as ''TRIPSþ'' measures), demonstrates the power of economic interests over public health considerations (59) . The WHO has convened an Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights to seek an international agreement to balance innovation and access to medicines, but agreement has remained elusive and negotiations continue (60, 61) .

Public health advocates argue that trade in goods with the potential to harm, such as arms, tobacco, and toxic and hazardous waste (known as ''public bads''), should be restricted and that such goods should not be included in trade liberalization efforts (62, 63) . However, such arguments have been successfully opposed by the industries behind such trade, often with the support of major governments, in order to protect their economic interests.

Countries also increasingly trade in health services, traditionally regarded as nontradable, as a result of advances in information and communication technologies, increased international mobility of service providers and patients, and growing participation by the private sector in health care (64) . Under the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services, trade of health services is categorized under 4 modes: cross-border delivery of samples or services, consumption of health services abroad, establishment of health facilities by a foreign-based concern, and movement of health personnel across borders (65, 66) . While the extent to which trade occurs varies across these modes, there is a general trend towards increased trade in health services (67, 68) . There are potential opportunities arising from such trade, including efficiency, specialization and quality gains, public sector cost savings, expansion of service provision, export revenues and remittances, transfer of technology and skills, and increased patient choice. The risks concern distributive consequences for domestic patients and the possible ''brain drain'' of health professionals from resource-scarce countries (69).

There is a broad body of literature on the health effects of trade in non-health-related goods and services. Trade of food has received particular attention, especially with regard to issues such as access to an appropriate quantity (underand overnutrition) and quality of food, factors that influence eating habits, and broader environmental issues (70) . The regulatory framework for trade of food is focused on the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Both, along with GATT Article XX(b), are concerned with preventing the spread of foodborne diseases while minimizing the required restrictions on trade, but application of restrictions is often controversial (71) . For example, the appropriateness of trade restrictions on beef from countries affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, on the grounds of protecting public health has been subject to ongoing dispute (72) . Similar disputes over the public health risks of trade in poultry products (H5N1), apples (due to fire blight), and genetically modified organisms have highlighted the ongoing tensions between promoting trade and protecting health (73) .

More broadly, unfair terms of trade and their contribution to health inequalities within and across countries has been the subject of scrutiny. The persistence of trade protectionism by many countries-in the form of agricultural subsidies, for instance-disadvantages low-income countries seeking economic growth through exports (74) . Economic pressure and the desire to attract foreign direct investment sometimes engender poor occupational and environmental health regulations (75) .

In summary, there has historically been friction between trade and health concerns, implying a need for greater coherence between trade and health policy (76) (77) (78) (79) . While countries have sometimes restricted trade to prevent the spread of disease, interactions between trade and health have generally been dominated by support for economic interests over health concerns and by a desire to minimize the impact of disease upon trade (80) .

Diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting international relations, and it ''provides one instrument that international actors use to implement their foreign policy'' (81, p. 318). Diplomacy has traditionally focused on dialogue and negotiating alliances, treaties, and other agreements. However, recent usage of the term ''health diplomacy'' has encompassed not only international agreements on health but also efforts to promote the role of global health in foreign policy, as well as the use of health interventions to support foreign-policy objectives.

The origins of modern health diplomacy can be traced to 1851, when the first International Sanitary Conference met to discuss cooperation on cholera, plague, and yellow fever (82) . Countries sought to meet after recognizing that the faster movement of people by rail and ship was facilitating the spread of disease and that uncoordinated, sometimes ineffectual, national quarantine policies interrupted trade and were causing discontent among merchants (82) . With the founding of the WHO after World War II, prior sanitary agreements were folded into 1 set of regulations, the International Sanitary Conventions (later renamed the International Health Regulations (IHRs)). The new Conventions maintained the spirit of the previous negotiations in attempting to coordinate disease control measures while ensuring the least amount of interference with international trade.

During the final decades of the 20th century, it became clear to many member states that the IHRs were inadequate: The regulations covered only 3 diseases, countries were often noncompliant, and the WHO had limited flexibility to conduct outbreak surveillance and response (83, 84) . Even with recognition of these weaknesses, attempted revisions of the IHRs stalled until the 2002-2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (83) . SARS demonstrated the direct and continuing threat that transnational disease epidemics pose to health and economic interests (85) and generated the political momentum necessary to complete the IHR revision process. In this case, a threat to state foreign-policy interests was critical to advancing diplomacy on global health.

However, in adopting the revised IHRs, countries gave the WHO a novel ability to intrude upon state interests, ''privileg[ing] global health governance over state sovereignty'' by allowing the use of surveillance reports from nongovernmental organizations and electronic surveillance systems (83, p. 90) . Actions taken by certain countries during the SARS epidemic, especially China's attempts to conceal disease information, precipitated these new WHO powers to overcome selfish state interests. Despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries and commentators have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue ''equity between developed and developing nations'' (86, p. 482 ) and risk fragmentation of poor countries' health systems and ''national health priorities set up by developing countries'' (87, p. 13) . These objections center on the IHRs' primary focus on disease surveillance, which some argue may be of greater importance to wealthy countries seeking protection from new epidemics than for poor countries with large existing disease burdens (87) . Thus, ''the WHO's authority in infectious disease control has been strengthened partly because it suited the interests of Western states to allow this to happen'' (88, p. 308) . Whether the IHRs primarily benefit wealthy states seeking to avoid epidemics or can also address burdens of disease in poorer countries will depend upon the nature of future efforts to build surveillance and response capacity in support of the IHRs.

The second critical diplomatic agreement on health was the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Approved by the World Health Assembly in 2003, the FCTC represents the WHO's first-ever use of its authority to create a global health treaty to ''reduce the growth and spread of the global tobacco epidemic'' (89, p. 936) . Unlike the IHRs, negotiation of the FCTC could not rely on the high political priority of such efforts. The WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative group gathered the extensive evidence that linked smoking to lung cancer, as well as studies on the negative economic impact caused by tobacco, which framed the treaty in terms of the economic self-interests of states (90) . The WHO also highlighted proven interventions that reduce tobacco consumption and formed a fruitful partnership with an effective coalition of nongovernmental organizations called the Framework Convention Alliance (91) .

While promoters of the treaty had ambitious goals and abundant scientific evidence to support stronger tobacco reduction policies, the treaty faced opposition from the governments of the United States, Japan, China, and Germany, all significant tobacco or tobacco-product producers, who succeeded in weakening the final text with flexibilities and optional language. Assunta and Chapman conclude that the ''flexibility in the FCTC language offers an ostensible excuse for. . . parties to the Convention to avoid development of robust comprehensive tobacco control policies'' (92, p. 755 ). There is also significant evidence that transnational tobacco companies sought to undermine the negotiations leading to the FCTC (93) . Finally ratified in 2005, the FCTC sets out broad obligations for reducing both tobacco demand and tobacco production, but the weakened language of the treaty, continuing opposition from transnational tobacco companies (94) , and different levels of commitment mean that enactment of FCTC measures is still highly variable across signatory countries.

As both the IHR and FCTC cases indicate, diplomatic health negotiations-even those viewed as triumphs of global health over foreign policy-are driven by state interests which can either facilitate or undermine global health objectives.

Spurred by the passage of the IHRs and the FCTC and the increasing political relevance of global health, a number of global health practitioners have advocated for and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health aims. The Oslo Ministerial Declaration, advanced by the ministers of foreign affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand in 2006, declares that ''health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda'' and that these countries have agreed ''to make health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies'' (95, p. 1373; 96) . Supporting this effort, the Director General of the WHO writes that ''we need to embed the use of the health lens in foreign policy while we have this chance'' but warns that this relationship requires ''careful management for mutual benefit'' (97, p. 498 ). The United Kingdom and Switzerland have enacted national strategies attempting to establish ''policy coherence'' between their global health and foreign policies (3, p. 971). A number of middle-income countries, including Brazil (98), Thailand (99) , and Indonesia (86), also highlight global health in their diplomacy. Finally, Kaufmann and Feldbaum (100) note how diplomacy can be an essential tool for resolving global health crises of political origins, such as the 2003-2004 Nigerian boycott of poliomyelitis vaccine.

Not all diplomacy on health seeks to achieve global health goals, and states are increasingly using health interventions to support ulterior foreign-policy objectives in efforts often termed ''health diplomacy.'' One prominent example is the hospital ship tours of the US Naval Ships Mercy and Comfort, in which these US military assets deliver health, disaster, and humanitarian assistance to underserved countries. These missions work to improve health but are also driven by training needs and the intent to ''win hearts and minds through the use of health interventions'' (101, p. 3) . Broader US investments in global health are also justified by foreign-policy interests; as a former US Senator stated, ''You do not go to war with someone who has saved the life of your child'' (42, p. 219). The United States is not alone in using health interventions to serve foreign-policy objectives; the Cuban health diplomacy program (102) and Chinese health cooperation in Africa (103) are other relevant examples. Other related attempts that utilize health as diplomatic outreach have been termed vaccine (104), science (105, 106) , and disaster (107, 108) diplomacy. Such efforts have not been without criticism. Ingram observes that such efforts may ultimately be ''self-defeating,'' as ''it is precisely the fact that health professionals are not associated with the policies of states that gives them wider credibility'' (109, p. 534) .

In summary, diplomacy has been used to craft international agreements to improve global health, but state interests have been critical to either the success or obstruction of such agreements. The increasing use of health interventions by states in service of foreign-policy interests also confirms the strong role of such interests in diplomacy on global health, and will present the global health community with ethical and policy challenges.

While a number of countries have integrated human security (with its focus on the safety and protection of individuals rather than states) into their foreign policies (110, 111) , issues of national security remain atop the foreign-policy hierarchy (112) . National security is a ''contested concept'' (113, p. 254 ) and has been defined both narrowly as ''the study of the threat, use, and control of military force'' (114, p. 212 ) and more broadly as an action or event that ''threatens drastically to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state, or. . . threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government'' (115, p. 133) . Resistance to broadening the definition of national security to include public health or environmental issues has also been apparent. Deudney argues that ''if everything that causes a decline in human well-being is labeled a 'security' threat, the term loses any analytical usefulness and becomes a loose synonym of 'bad' '' (116, p. 448 ).

King writes that ''although often characterized as an humanitarian activity, modern public health as practiced in the United States and other Western industrialized nations has long been associated with the needs of national security and international commerce'' (117, p. 763) . For example, the founding of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine by Sir Patrick Manson, medical advisor to the Colonial Office (118) , was driven by the need to better understand tropical diseases to assure ''the health of European soldiers, traders and settlers in hostile climates'' (117, p. 765) . Similarly, the US successes against malaria and yellow fever, which enabled the building of the Panama Canal, were driven by the desire to control this strategic and economically valuable passage (119, 120) .

The close association between public health and national security was broken in the 20th century by decolonization, improved sanitation, and the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, which together reduced the threat of disease to powerful countries and their interests (121) , and by the specter of nuclear weapons, which came to dominate national security studies (114) . However, by the 1990s, perceptions of increased vulnerability to infectious disease threats because of increased global interdependence brought infectious diseases back onto national security agendas. This was prominently expressed by the US Institute of Medicine: ''[I]n the context of infectious diseases, there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected'' (122, p. V).

Acute outbreaks of infectious diseases and the threat of bioterrorism have dominated recent national security discussions of global health, suggesting that global health issues gain political priority when they threaten state interests (33, 123) . The SARS and H1N1 influenza A epidemics, the threat of H5N1 influenza A, and, to a lesser extent, the spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis have threatened the citizens and economic interests of powerful countries and have been accepted as national security threats (124) . Similarly, increasing knowledge about the extent of existing biological weapons programs (125) , the rise of nonstate terrorist actors, and the global dissemination of advances in biology (126) have driven many wealthy states to address bioterrorism as a serious threat to national security. The benefits of designating a global health issue a threat to national security include high levels of both political attention and funding (34) .

However, the benefits of linking global health to national security have not come without criticism or costs. McInnes and Lee argue that the national security agenda on health has been narrowly framed and ''dominated by the concerns of foreign and security policy, not of global public health'' (33, p. 22) , while Feldbaum et al. caution that the ''global and humanitarian objectives of the health field do not fit readily into the state-centered perspective of national security'' (127, p. 196 ). The costs of framing international cooperation on epidemic diseases in security terms are also becoming apparent. ''Developing countries are increasingly suspicious of global health initiatives justified on the grounds of 'global health security' '' (128, p. 372) because ''the harvest of outbreak intelligence overseas is essentially geared to benefit wealthy nations'' (87, p. 19) . Controversy over sharing of H5N1 influenza A viral samples (86, 129) and within negotiations over the IHRs (87) are examples of developing countries' resistance to the concept of global health security.

The framing of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a threat to national security, predominantly between 2000 and 2005, also provides insights into the costs and benefits of linking health issues to national security agendas. This linkage, which generated attention from the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, raised the political priority of HIV/AIDS, which contributed to efforts to establish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and increased the amount of development assistance for health on global AIDS, particularly in the United States (130, 131) . However, much of the evidence used to frame the disease as a national security threat, including evidence on the prevalence of HIV among African militaries (132, 133) and its potential to cause instability in ''next wave'' states (134, p. 4; 135) , has been shown to be inaccurate (136) (137) (138) (139) (140) . Furthermore, linkage of the disease to national security agendas may have contributed to the possibly disproportionate focus on the pandemic in national aid budgets (141) and has been criticized (142) for its potential to push response to the disease ''away from civil society toward state institutions such as the military and the intelligence community'' (143, p. 122) or to push funding towards countries of strategic importance, rather than those most in need (127) .

Health interventions are being used in complex and contradictory ways in conflict situations. The public health community has sought to implement ''health as a bridge to peace,'' claiming that health interventions in ''postconflict societies can be specifically designed in such a way as to simultaneously have a positive effect upon the health of the population and contribute to the creation of a stable and lasting peace'' (144, p. 96) . Other practitioners have noted that cease-fires arranged for vaccine delivery (145, 146) and cooperative health projects between previously conflicting parties can provide beneficial and neutral forums for conflict resolution (147) (148) (149) (150) . However, critics say such efforts have ''never yielded a tangible peace benefit'' (151, p. 222) and have been driven more by ''ideology'' than evidence of effectiveness (152, p. 1020).

Militaries and nonstate actors alike are using health interventions to serve their political aims in conflict situations.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, medical and veterinary civilassistance programs are run by the US military ''for supporting pacification, gathering local intelligence, or rewarding locals for their cooperation'' (153, p. 69) . On the other side, Burkle reports that the Iraqi insurgents fighting the US military ''made controlling hospitals a priority because by owning the health and social services, the control of the people soon followed'' (154, p. 31) . In these cases, health interventions are not neutral or designed as a bridge to peace but are used to gain the support of, or control over, local populations through the offering or denial of health services.

Tension exists between public health and national security in part because ''the landscape of political insecurity is not fully congruent with the landscape of need'' (109, p. 539) . Prioritization of health issues as national security threats can generate political attention and funding but can also result in actions directed toward addressing national security interests that may or may not coincide with public health needs.

Evidence on the linkages between global health, aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security indicates that state action on health is often motivated by foreign-policy interests rather than a desire to promote health equity or achieve humanitarian benefits. These ulterior interests can be economic (protecting trade), diplomatic (preventing epidemics), strategic (preventing bioterrorism), or (often) combinations of these interests and are salient even in this new era of rising development aid for health and groundbreaking global health treaties. Conversely, little evidence supports the notion that ''foreign policy is now being substantially driven by health'' (3, p. 971). However, global health has affected the practice of foreign policy on occasions when global health and foreign-policy interests align, as the cases of SARS and the IHRs demonstrate.

While foreign-policy interests are likely to continue to determine state engagement on global health issues, selfserving motives for state action on health do not have to lead to poor outcomes, as evidenced by US aid for Egypt's leading to improved child health or the provision of medical relief by the US Naval Ship Comfort and Cuban medical professionals after the earthquake in Haiti. Whether we achieve further successes in global health or our efforts are undermined by the pursuit of traditional foreign-policy interests will depend upon the ability of public health practitioners to understand foreign-policy perspectives on health and promote global health interests in the world of high politics.

"Capacity of Public Health Surveillance to Comply with Revised International Health Regulations, USA Author affi liations: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","Public health surveillance is essential for detecting and responding to infectious diseases and necessary for compliance with the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. To assess reporting capacities and compliance with IHR of all 50 states and Washington, DC, we sent a questionnaire to respective epidemiologists; 47 of 51 responded. Overall reporting capacity was high. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported being able to transmit notifi cations about unknown or unexpected events to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) daily. Additionally, 80% of respondents reported use of a risk assessment tool to determine whether CDC should be notifi ed of possible public health emergencies. These fi ndings suggest that most states have systems in place to ensure compliance with IHR. However, full state-level compliance will require additional efforts.","T he 2005 revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) were a major global policy achievement to ensure international recognition and notifi cation of unusual public health events. These regulations are an international legal instrument that binds 194 countries (World Health Organization [WHO] member states). The goal of IHR 2005 is to help the international community prevent or respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten the global population. As seen with the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, diseases have the potential to spread quickly around the globe through international travel and trade (1) . Member states are required to report certain diseases and public health events to WHO. Furthermore, the rights and obligations of member states are defi ned to establish procedures that WHO must follow to uphold global public health security (2) .

The 2005 revision was the fi rst major update to the IHR since 1969 and was designed to refl ect trends in disease emergence and spread over the past several decades. The 2005 revision also was meant to unify the considerable changes in communication capacity, disease surveillance, and investigation infrastructure. Member states must report potential public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), including those of biologic, chemical, radionuclear, or unknown origin, to WHO. A common decision matrix that focuses national reporting around a risk assessment process is used rather than sole reliance on reporting of specifi c diseases or incidents (3). This method of reporting requires all member states to develop, strengthen, and maintain a core set of public health surveillance and response capacities at the local, intermediate, and national levels (4).

After IHR revision in 2005, member states were provided a 2-year window in which to assess their surveillance and response capacities, focusing on 4 necessary characteristics of surveillance systems: timeliness, sensitivity, stability, and usefulness (3) . Each of the 194 member states also was required to designate a National Focal Point that would assess any event within 48 hours. After the assessment specifi ed in Appendix 2 of IHR 2005, each member state must notify WHO of any potential PHEIC. Therefore, core public health surveillance systems at local and national levels must be capable of ensuring national awareness of incidents in a timely manner.

Surveillance systems exist at many levels: clinics; hospitals; and local, state, national, regional, and global levels. To be effective, these different levels must be well integrated. Literature on surveillance systems often examines each level separately or, at most, the links between 2 adjacent levels, describing the importance of integrating each system so that communication between levels is more effective (3, (5) (6) (7) . State-to-national notifi cation is a key aspect of federalist systems and has been viewed as a key challenge for countries with this type of government structure (3); several authors have noted the political and practical diffi culties these surveillance systems may face and the various ways national disease surveillance can be facilitated (8) .

In the United States, reporting of nationally notifi able diseases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by states is voluntary. Public health surveillance takes place within a state on the basis of reports received from a variety of sources, typically local. Reporting is mandated by state legislation or regulation. States then determine whether CDC should be notifi ed. Notifi cations from states, territories, and the District of Columbia are collected and analyzed by the National Notifi able Diseases Surveillance System. A 2004 review of this system showed that for meningococcal disease laboratory results, local entities reported to their states and then states notifi ed NNDSS within 2-117 days (5) . More recently, 60% of meningococcal diagnosis reports were received by states within 1 day after diagnosis (9) .

The literature identifi es essential elements that surveillance systems need to meet IHR 2005 criteria, including electronic information systems and supportive infrastructure, to ensure timely reporting to the National Focal Point (6, 7) . In addition, intergovernment cooperation with both formal and informal communication, from the local to the international level, are essential aspects of successfully functioning public health surveillance systems (3, 6, 8) and can ensure rapid reporting of incidents before laboratory confi rmation is received (3, 6) . Overall, key aspects of successful surveillance systems identifi ed in the literature align closely with the requirements of IHR 2005. This alignment suggests that systems built in accordance with the agreement will provide successful global coverage.

Since the new regulations took effect, no studies have been done to determine the timeliness of reporting conditions specifi ed in IHR 2005. In addition, no reports exist that discuss timeliness of notifi cation to CDC about unusual cases or outbreaks of unknown cause. To address these gaps and to determine the ability of states to comply with IHR 2005, we assessed state surveillance capacities through surveys completed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). This assessment examined several key requirements that are necessary to effectively meet national responsibilities and ensure compliance with IHR 2005.

In February 2009, CSTE electronically distributed a structured, self-administered questionnaire to state epidemiologists in all 50 states and Washington, DC. Responses were made anonymous at the time of data analysis. The questionnaire was designed to address the following questions: 1) How are states able to determine the status of potential public health emergencies? 2) Are local health departments able to report in a timely manner to the correct point-of-contact (POC) in their state? 3) Are states able to notify CDC of public health emergencies in a timely manner (i.e., within 24 hours)? 4) Do states support or implement other control measures (i.e., collaboration with other departments or cross-jurisdiction)? Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the results.

The CSTE State Reportable Conditions Assessment, completed by state epidemiologists, also was used to assess state reporting practices. Information was obtained from the 2007 Assessment, which is available for review by all states and territories (10) .

A total of 47 (92%) of the 51 eligible jurisdictions responded to the questionnaire. Eighty percent of respondents reported the use of risk assessments to determine the necessity of notifying CDC about unusual or unexpected events ( Figure 1 ). Of those who used risk assessments, ≈50% used them to initiate formal investigations. About 50% of respondents reported the use of risk assessments to evaluate whether notifi cation to the state health offi cer (51%), chief emergency response/management offi ce (47%), and CDC or other federal entities (51%), respectively, was necessary. Twentyeight percent reported use of a state-based algorithm; 25% reported use of the WHO algorithm for risk assessments. The remainder of respondents used another algorithm (excluding a state-based algorithm or the WHO algorithm) or were not sure of the algorithm used in their state.

More than 90% of jurisdictions required reports of suspected and probable cases of the 4 immediately notifi able IHR 2005 conditions (i.e., smallpox, poliomyelitis caused by wild-type poliovirus, human infl uenza caused by a new subtype, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) within 24 hours after diagnosis (Table 1 ). In addition, 96% of states reported that they would notify CDC of suspected and probable cases of IHR 2005 conditions within 24 hours (Table 1) . Eighty-one percent of respondents reported having the capacity to transmit daily notifi cations to CDC. Of those unable to transmit daily notifi cations, 5 indicated that they would be able to provide daily electronic data to CDC within <1 year All respondents reported they would either always or sometimes notify CDC of an unusual or unexpected case or outbreak; 60% reported they would always notify CDC within 24 hours (Figure 2 ). Among the respondents, 30% would sometimes notify CDC within 24 hours. According to the 2007 State Reportable Conditions Assessment, 48 of the jurisdictions included unusual or unexpected events on their reportable conditions lists. Furthermore, most states could identify a specifi c POC in their state for reporting various public health events and emergencies (Figure 3 ). Ninety-one percent of states reported having a designated POC for zoonotic, foodborne, and infectious events; for chemical and radiologic events, 84% and 86% of states, respectively, reported having a designated POC.

More than 50% of respondents reported having formal information-sharing systems or mechanisms pertaining to emergencies or outbreaks with state law enforcement, emergency management and homeland security, agriculture, environmental protection, and fi sh and wildlife agencies, excluding the state departments of transportation (37%) ( Table 2 ). Fifty-one percent reported participating in cross-jurisdiction electronic surveillance and having reporting systems for foodborne and infectious diseases with neighboring states.

Most states can successfully conduct public health surveillance in compliance with IHR 2005. However, full state-level capacity for compliance was not found on any assessment response. Additional efforts are needed to ensure the ability of the United States to meet its IHR 2005 obligations.

Most states reported use of risk assessments to determine the need to notify CDC about unusual or unexpected events. In addition, ≈50% of states reported the use of risk assessment when initiating a formal investigation. IHR 2005 emphasizes the use of risk assessments to notify WHO about public health emergencies, rather than about specifi c events. The use of risk assessments in notifying CDC can help determine whether notifi cation is necessary and ensure timely notifi cation without waiting for laboratory confi rmation.

Most (>80%) states reported having 1 POC for reporting chemical, radiologic, foodborne, infectious, and zoonotic events. All states should have a POC to facilitate prompt assessment and appropriate reporting. Such contacts also can assist in assessing events outside their areas of expertise or with unknown cause.

Reports of capacity to transmit daily notifi cations to CDC suggest that data collection and transmission capacity has improved substantially in recent years. The ability to transmit reports to CDC is a critical function, which allows for national situational awareness in high-profi le events and public health emergencies.

Not all respondents included unusual or unexpected events on their state's reportable conditions lists. Adding this criterion would help ensure that conditions having the potential to become public health emergencies can be recognized and reported in a timely manner.

Internal and external relationships of each state can play a role in reporting. Most states have formal information-sharing systems with other agencies within their state. Such dissemination of information within a state increases the likelihood that IHR reportable events are appropriately evaluated and reported. Other agencies may have knowledge that could be incorporated into a risk assessment.

About 50% of respondents reported participation in cross-jurisdictional electronic surveillance and having reporting systems for foodborne and infectious diseases. Public health surveillance across state jurisdictions is as important as the sharing of information within a state. Neighboring states can be alerted to public health emergencies that have the potential to become widespread or even global. Our assessment has several limitations. First, only states were assessed; neither territories nor local health departments were included. Circumstances are suffi ciently different in the territories; no conclusions about their capacity should be drawn because they are likely to have different reporting practices and capacities. Future assessments should focus on identifying and documenting capacities for IHR 2005 compliance in at least a sample of jurisdictions at the local or county level. Second, our assessment relied on self-reporting, which in some instances may have led to inaccuracies or bias. Data were made anonymous before analysis so that states would not be singled out as having suboptimal reporting practices or capacities. Therefore, we could not inquire about potential discrepancies.

To enable the United States to fully meet its IHR 2005 obligations, all states should include unusual or unexpected events or outbreaks on their state lists of reportable conditions. In addition, states and CDC should work toward further development of the nationally notifi able conditions list and the timeframes for reporting. The capacity to transmit records to CDC on a daily basis is key to full compliance with IHR 2005. Risk assessments of unusual or unexpected events should be performed to determine whether they meet requirements for notifi cation to CDC as a potential PHEIC. Performing such risk assessments will enable timely notifi cation to CDC, even before laboratory confi rmation. Furthermore, state POCs are likely to facilitate recognition and reporting of potential public health emergencies within their respective states.

State health departments should work to ensure that their counterparts in state government and in local health departments understand the requirements of IHR 2005; reporting exercises may help accomplish this goal. All health offi cials, particularly those at the state level, should have a basic understanding of these international regulations, especially the reporting and notifi cation timeframes and practices. Reporting exercises would give state and local health offi cials the ability to assess potential public health emergencies in a practice environment and allow a broader perspective of when notifi cation is necessary.

Expansion of cross-jurisdictional surveillance and reporting systems also would benefi t national recognition and investigation of public health emergencies, especially for foodborne illness and infectious diseases. Such systems are not explicitly required by IHR 2005 but would assist states in the assessment and timely reporting of public health emergencies, both of which are necessary for compliance. National, state, and local government agencies should assist states in implementing these practices and developing appropriate infrastructures.

Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries,"Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.","Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are found widely in humans and other mammals. 1 Even though most human coronavirus infections result in mild diseases, the world has had two major epidemics in the past two decades from two different betacoronaviruses; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Collectively, these two outbreaks have resulted in more than 10 000 cumulative cases, with fatal ity rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. 2 In December 2019, China reported to WHO cases of pneumonia of unknown cause occurring in Wuhan, Hubei. 3 Initial patients exhibited clinical symptoms resembling viral pneumonia. The country's capacity to detect cases facilitated early recognition and verification of the pathogen. Viral genetic sequencing of samples indicated a novel coronavirus. 4 The novel virus was named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and con firmed to have 75-80% resemblance to SARS-CoV. 2 As of Feb 24, 2020, approximately 80 000 confirmed cases have been reported in more than 28 countries. 5 On Jan 30, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern and put in place a series of temporary recommendations. 6 No specific antiviral therapies are available, and efforts to dev elop antivirals and a vaccine continue. Early indi cations suggest that bats are the primary reservoir for the virus, given COVID-19's close similarity to bat coronaviruses, 7 and while identification of the zoonotic origin of the virus continues, the public health measures for managing the outbreak rely on existing national and regional preparedness capacities to prevent, detect, verify, assess, and respond in accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) .

Since the IHR came into force in 2007, countries have made substantial efforts to strengthen their capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies. 8 Countries have been enhancing preparedness through the implementation and regular assessment of IHR national capacities to mitigate the effect of public health emergencies, including the emer gence of a novel pathogen. 9, 10 Increased understanding of the capacities that countries have to prevent, detect, and respond to public health events has been made possible through the introduction of the WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework and application of the framework's components including the State Party annual reporting (SPAR) process and voluntary external evaluation using the Joint External Evaluation tools, after-action reviews, and simulation exercises. 11 The results of these assessments are used to develop national action plans to strengthen IHR capacities for health security. WHO bench marks for IHR capacities include corresponding actions that can increase a country's emergency preparedness, and are used to strengthen a country's emergency preparedness and health security. 12 We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries to review health security capacities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and iden tified opportunities for further strengthening of IHR implementation. 13, 14 

We analysed 2018 SPAR submissions to review health security capacities on the basis of the following indices: capacities to (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function (resources and coordination capacity), and (5) operational readiness. National scores for 18 of the 24 SPAR indi cators were applied across the five indices. Six SPAR indicators that were not directly related to our indices and infectious hazard threats, including COVID-19, were excluded. 13 The SPAR indicators selected for use in each of the five indices are shown in panel 1. Each indicator of the SPAR is scored according to a scale from level 1 to 5, in which level 1 is the lowest capacity and level 5 is the highest. 13 Countries without a score were marked as level 0. Panel 1 shows the rationale for including the indicators as part of the respective indices.

For each of the five indices we developed an index score using the following steps: (1) we grouped key indicators from the SPAR submissions according to our five indices; 13 (2) each indicator score was converted to a percentage;

(3) we aggregated indicator scores using an arithmetic average: (4) we categorised countries on an ordinal scale of levels 1-5 on the basis of the scores of the indices. These five levels are similar to the capacity levels used to assess countries using SPAR (panel 2). 13, 14 

We analysed the 2018 SPAR submissions of 182 countries. 2018 SPAR data does not exist for 14 State Parties and therefore could not be included as part of this study. 15 138 (76%) of 182 countries included were found to have an overall detection capacity at level 4 or 5. 52 (28%) countries had levels 1 or 2 capacities to prevent and 60 (33%) countires had levels 1 or 2 capacities to respond, many of which are classified as low-income and lower-middle-income countries by the World Bank. 81 (44%) countries had level 4 or 5 capacities to prevent, and 78 (43%) countries had level 4 or 5 capacities to respond. 102 (56%) countries had a level 4 or 5 enabling function. 49 (27%) countries had prevent, 34 (19%) had detect, 44 (24%) had respond, 36 (20%) had enabling function,

Evidence before this study The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) has spread rapidly across many countries in a short space of time. Few studies have highlighted the strength and gaps of national capacities in relation to operational readiness against health emergencies and the state of national International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) implementation. We searched PubMed using the search terms ""operational readiness index"" in relation to ""IHR"", ""health security"", and ""emergency preparedness"" for articles published in English, between Jan 1, 2010, and Jan 24, 2020. Our search found zero results on the operational readiness index in relation to IHR.

Because of the insufficient quality of information that exists about the state of national and regional preparedness capacities, we used data and information from IHR State Party Annual Reporting tool to review existing levels of health security capacities to prevent, detect, respond, and establish enabling functions for an effective response, and operational readiness against public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks.

Our results have implications for prioritising capacity building action in WHO Regions and countries, especially in terms of capacities regarding prevention, detection, response, enabling functions, and operational readiness. The operational readiness index can be used to support WHO, governments, and other international agencies to prioritise their support and implementation of operational readiness capacities for the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Infection prevention and control at the community and healthcare facility level is key for prevention, control and containment of the infection. 16 

Reaching out to communities at the local, national, and global levels are essential for prevention, detection, and control of the infection. 17

Core capacities to prevent, detect, and respond at the points of entry are crucial for prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Capacity to detect C5.1-specimen referral and transport system; C5.3-access to laboratory testing capacity for priority diseases Not all countries will have capacity to test specimens. Therefore, countries should have a system of specimen referral, transportation, and testing of suspected cases.

Reporting from communities, health-care facilities, and points of entry are crucial for prevention and detection of infectious disease outbreaks.

Capacity for verification, risk assessment, and analysis investigation is crucial for the prevention, detection, and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Response capacity depends on availability of preparedness and response plans and mechanisms and regular testing for functionality and updating them to address gaps.

Any public health events require incident management systems to be followed. Therefore, the capacity to respond effectively to an outbreak depends on strong capacity of emergency operations.

During response, all types of resources must be mobilised in a timely manner (funds, human resources, and logistics).

Effective response to outbreaks and other health emergencies depends on case management.

Capacity for infection prevention and control is needed for effective case management and infection control.

Any suspected case detected at points of entry needs to be managed effectively, otherwise the risk of transmission across borders remains high.

Enabling function index C1.3-financing mechanism and funds for timely response to public health emergencies Availability and accessibility of financing mechanisms is essential for prevention, detection, and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

Multisectoral coordination and action is needed to manage public health events including infectious disease outbreaks.

During emergencies, different skillsets, surge capacity, and timely mobilisation of health-care workers are needed to prevent, detect, and control events.

During response, all types of resources must be mobilised to manage events.

Access to the essential health services are needed to prevent, detect, and control infectious disease outbreaks. Continuity of essential health services must be ensured during emergencies. 18 13 have been used to develop an index for operational readiness. The index helps to assess the status of national readiness capacities across each WHO region. A full description of these indicators is given in the appendix. According to WHO, high-level operational readiness to respond to emergencies will allow a timely, effective, and efficient response. Achieving readiness is a continuous process of establishing, strengthening, and maintaining a multisectoral response infrastructure that can be applied at all levels, which follows an all-hazard approach, and which focuses on the highest priority risks. Operational readiness builds on existing capacities to design and set up specialised arrangements and services for an emergency response. 19 IHR=International Health Regulations. 

Wide variation exists in the capacity for operational readiness across regions (figure 2). 21 (45%) of 47 the countries in the WHO African Region and five (22%) of 23 countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region had low capacities for operational readiness. Across all regions, 104 (57%) of 182 countries had operational readiness capaci ties at level 4 (66 [36%]) and level 5 (38 [21%]). No countries were at level 5 for operational readiness in the African and South-East Asia regions. 46 (25%) of all countries had an operational readiness capacity at level 3.

We found that countries varied widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and control outbreaks, with about half the countries reporting operational readiness capacities to respond to public health emergencies. We used the 2018 SPAR data, which is self-reported by countries to represent their capacity levels; the data are not independently verified. The inclusion of additional data sources from external IHR monitoring and assessment exercises was excluded from this study because countries are assessed across multiple years. 20 For instance, over 100 countries have implemented joint external evaluations to date, which have been carried out between 2016 and 2019. 20 The SPAR data that we used reflects the capacity of countries in 2018 only. Although

Very little functional capacity is in place to prevent and control the risk or event.

Little functional capacity available on an ad-hoc basis with the support of external resources.

The country is functionally capable at the national level; however, effectiveness is low at the subnational levels.

The country is functionally capable of dealing with various events at the national and subnational levels.

The country's functional capacity is well advanced and sustainable at all levels of health systems. the use of independently verified data would be useful (eg, external assessments such as joint external evaluations) for a review of this nature, this limitation is minimised by the fact that SPAR data has been shown to correlate strongly with externally evaluated data such as the Joint External Evaluation results. 21 Several factors affect the emergence and spread of an infectious disease outbreak within countries and between regions, including the strength of IHR capacities at the national and subnational levels, adherence to infection prevention and control measures, climate-related pressures, and the density of populations. 8, 16, 22 When an outbreak is caused by an airborne pathogen, population density or crowding is known to directly affect spread of infection. 22 Analysis of other risk variables associated with tackling an infectious disease outbreak and managing health emergencies would benefit understanding of existing country capacities, including vulnerabilities due to socioeconomic conditions, comorbid conditions, and lack of health infrastructure, which we did not take into account.

The information and data from these exercises should be analysed to build and inform readiness and response plans for preventing and controlling health emergencies including the outbreak of COVID-19. The analyses of the operational readiness index have been used to support the development of a draft WHO strategic preparedness and response plan for COVID-19. 23 These findings must be triangulated with the latest risk assessments available for COVID-19 and other assessments such as Joint External Evaluations, after-action reviews, simulation exercises, and others to understand the capacity level of countries and to implement priority actions at the national and subnational levels. 19, 23 The WHO Secretariat is working on the development of a preparedness dashboard to provide real-time information that is based on these capacity assessments. Another limitation is related to the method being based on a deterministic approach; therefore, proportionate or inverse interactions among variables could not be shown. 24 An effective way of managing airborne infections is applying evidence-based public health prevention strategies. 16, 17, 22 This method includes scaling up public awareness of behaviours such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, communicating and engaging with local communities about the risks of the outbreak, and putting in place effective public health response measures. 17, 25, 26 National points of entry should also have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats in line with the IHR. Many countries have low capacities for preventing the occurrence and spread of outbreaks, such as measles, influenza, Ebola virus. 27, 28 Therefore, enhancing national preparedness capacities in line with the gaps identified in this study should incorporate action to strengthen points of entry.

Many countries have made substantial progress in developing effective levels of disease detection, which involves strengthening surveillance and laboratory capacities. The application of lessons learned from previous infectious disease emergencies including the 2002 SARS-CoV, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, and Zika virus outbreaks, have helped to strengthen countries' capacities to effectively detect and verify suspect cases. 5, 8, 28, 29 The early detection of COVID-19 in China and the development of laboratory reagents for testing and genetically sequencing the novel virus are key steps that have supported the early response. 29 We showed that 76% of countries have robust detection capacities in place, which will enable early detection and verification of potential outbreaks when they occur.

A country's response capacity depends on the strength of its emergency preparedness and the regular testing and updating of national plans and capacities. 30 An effec tive response to an outbreak depends not only on the availability of adequate human resources and financing, but also on the ability to manage emergency logistics (including the handling of supply chains for essential products that are required during an emergency). Our findings show that many countries need support to achieve these capacities and increased support should be provided as a global priority action to strengthen health security. Our findings on operational readiness capacities and enabling function, which are low in many low-resource countries, underline the importance of increasing investments in scaling up IHR capacities, as described in the 2019 annual report of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board. 8 Another challenge underpinning low national preparedness capacities is insufficient investment in human capital and poor continuity planning. 18, 31, 32 The world needs to increase investment in anthropologists, data scientists, communication specialist, educationists, and economists, who are all essential in providing necessary support for the control of infectious disease outbreaks. 12, 31, 32 The important role these specialists play in responding to outbreaks, including Ebola virus, MERS-CoV, cholera, and measles are well documented, and a key lesson from these public health emergencies has been to ensure that these skillsets are developed further. 32 Our data reinforce this notion, given the low capacities that many countries have to prevent and respond to health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks effectively.

In the past 5 years, multisectoral coordination and collabo ration for health security strengthening has improved substantially. This coordination and collaboration is reinforced by the introduction of voluntary IHR external evaluation processes, including Joint External Evaluations, which have successfully brought multiple sectors together around common plans for national preparedness capacity building. 34 However, we showed that half of the countries analysed have low enabling functions, which means that coordination and collaboration have been insufficient. The COVID-19 outbreak requires a robust mechanism of collaboration and coordination at the global, national, and subnational levels to prevent, detect, and respond effectively.

The availability of essential health services at the community level is highly important for the ability of countries to minimise potential health emergencies during the earliest stages. Access to essential health services is one of the key indicators that contributes to the indices of enabling function and operational readiness. When an outbreak occurs, national health systems should be strong enough to be able to ensure the continued delivery of essential healthcare services, including immunisation and maternal health services. Many countries, especially those that are low resource, have insufficient access to essential health services. 34 Expanding access to essential health services in such countries would support the achievement of effective operational readiness, which is insufficient for many countries, as shown in our analysis.

According to WHO, operational readiness for emergencies will allow a timely, effective, and efficient response. 19 Achieving operational readiness is a continuous process of establishing, strengthening, and maintaining a multisectoral response infrastructure that can be applied at all levels, which follows an all-hazard approach, and which focuses on the highest priority risks. 19 Our analysis shows that more than 50% of countries analysed had the highest levels of operational readiness capacities; however, findings must be integrated with findings from local risk assessments to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. 23 The findings of our analysis are similar to those of other publications that have assessed health security capacities. 36, 37 A study 36 on the assessments of health security capacities in the African Region also found similar variances in the capacity of countries. Using an analysis of results of joint external evaluations, most of the countries of the African Region have been shown to have national capacity levels of between 1 and 3, and none have achieved level 5. This variance in national capacities is similar to our findings on the operational readiness index. 36 A study 37 of systemic resilience based on one composite measure of IHR core capacities to manage cross-border infectious diseases showed that improvement in IHR capacities is associated with a decrease of incidence of cross-border infection in Europe. 37 This level of capacity is also reflected in our study, in which most of the countries of the WHO European Region were level 4 or 5 as per the operational readiness index. 37 Some countries have stronger capacities than others; however, all countries should invest in build ing greater preparedness against health emergencies.

Assessments of IHR (2005) capacities reveal that advances have been made since 2010 in many countries to better detect potential outbreaks of infectious diseases early and test suspect cases rapidly-eg, the early detection and verification of the novel coronavirus cases by China and other countries. 38 All countries are at risk of COVID-19 and other outbreaks of infectious diseases, and countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and control outbreaks COVID-19 is not fully understood, which can further aggravate the situation. Therefore these findings should be combined with the latest risk assessments that are available for COVID-19 and other assessments to understand the existing capacities. The WHO Secretariat is developing the preparedness dashboard (a data visualisation platform that will include a query system) to provide real-time information that is based on various capacity assessments. Despite the gains made in understanding the pathogen, many countries are underprepared to manage cases within their borders. Investments in preparedness urgently need to be scaled up to ensure that vulnerable countries are operationally ready and capable to respond to public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

Many countries are struggling to sustain or develop their national preparedness capacities, primarily because of a lack of resources, competing national priorities, and a high turnover of health-care workers. Only half of the countries analysed in this study have the provision for adequate resources for emer gencies, and these countries are mostly either high-income or middle-income countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that capacities are in place to prevent and manage health emergencies. The outbreak of COVID-19 is another opportunity to review the preparedness of all countries and apply key recommendations from other major public health emergencies to better protect the world against future health emergencies.

Investigating public health emergency response information system initiatives in China,"Infectious diseases pose a great danger to public health internationally. The outbreak of SARS has exposed China's fragile public health system and its limited ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner. In order to strengthen its capability of responding to future public health emergencies, China is developing a public health emergency response information system (PHERIS) to facilitate disease surveillance, detection, reporting, and response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ongoing development of China's PHERIS. This paper analyzes the problems of China's existing public health system and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both technical and managerial aspects.","Recent years have witnessed a number of microbial threats which have greatly jeopardized public health in many areas of the world. One of the most publicized cases is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) whose outbreak and rapid spread in more than 25 countries in early 2003, claimed numerous lives and caused tremendous economic losses. Other public health threats include the recent anthrax attack and outbreak of avian influenza in the United States. It is predicted that new pathogens, originating either naturally or from bioterrorism, will continue to emerge and cause new public health emergencies [1] . In order to contain the spread of infectious diseases, preparedness planning, a vigilant health system, strengthened domestic, and global disease surveil-lance, and strong interdisciplinary partnerships are needed. Admittedly, information technology which facilitates access to critical information at the opportune moment will play a strategic role in improving the delivery and effectiveness of quality patient care, and helping domestic and international communities to adequately respond to medical emergencies in a timely and efficient manner.

After the first patient at China's Guangdong province was infected by SARS, this strong contagious disease was transmitted to health care workers and family members in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada within days, providing a vivid illustration of the rapidity and ease with which infectious disease can spread to pose a global public health threat [1] . Therefore, response to public health emergencies should be regarded as a global issue and a close worldwide co-ordination is needed. Particular attention should be paid to developing countries that have relatively fewer resources to deal with public health emergencies. China was one of the countries that were the most affected by SARS. Among the 8445 cases re-ported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5327 (63%) were from China [2] . Exploiting many effective control measures, China was able to successfully deter the outbreak in a relatively short time [3] . Nonetheless, the rampancy of SARS in the early stage of the outbreak has resulted in a chaos and exposed the fragility of China's public health information systems. As Qiang Gao, the secretary of the Ministry of Health (MOH), admitted [4] :

In terms of our work, MOH was not well prepared against the sudden public health hazards and its epidemic prevention system was relatively weak. Following the outbreak, the Ministry failed to institute a timely and unified mechanism for collecting, processing and reporting the relevant information nationwide and it did not give out clear cut instructions or effective guidance. . . . Due to a lack of a sound system of information collection, surveillance reporting and contact tracing there have appeared major weaknesses in statistics compilation on the epidemic on the part of the relevant agencies and accurate figures have not been reported to higher authorities in a timely manner.

Realizing the weakness of its public health systems, China is undertaking tremendous efforts to improve its public health system by leveraging the power of information technology. The Chinese central and local governments have appropriated sizable financial resources to build a public health emergency response information system (PHERIS). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ongoing development of China's PHERIS. The paper reviews the literature regarding emergency response information systems, analyzes the weakness of China's old public health system, and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both technical and managerial aspects.

A large portion of past research and development on emergency response systems has been conducted in the United States mostly because of the past and potential future terrorist attacks [5] [6] [7] [8] . In order to identify the relevant literature, we searched research databases including PubMed, IEEE Explore, and ACM Digital Library. The search was performed, using different combination of keywords, such as ''public health'', ''emergency system'', ''emergency response'', ''emergency response systems'', ''surveillance'', and ''bioterrorism''. We also collected information from the official websites of organizations, including the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Health and Human Services (HHS), which have been sponsoring emergency response information systems initiatives. In this section we will review some major IT development and research initiatives that have been completed or are currently undergoing in the US. It should be noted that this review does not represent a comprehensive coverage of the entire body of research and practice relating to public health emergency information systems, as we only selected those that we believed are most relevant to the topic of this article.

Motivated by a series of naturally occurring and manmade disasters, federal and state governments, as well as private companies, have implemented numerous initiatives to create co-ordinated systems for surveillance, detection, and response. Given the wide recognition that the application of information technology (IT) provides previously unfathomed opportunities to improve public health practice [9] [10] [11] , many of these initiatives have sought the exploitation of IT to resolve public health threats. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there exist 217 information technologies and decision support systems of potential use in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other public health emergencies involving naturally occurring epidemics [12] . One of the most important applications of IT is public health surveillance which encompasses the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data for use in planning, implementing, and evaluating public health practice [13, 14] . Some example surveillance systems include a national retail data monitor which was designed to collect and analyze sales of over-the-counter health products to detect outbreak of disease [15] , a clinical data warehouse which was used for hospital infection control [16] , a data mining surveillance system which can provide sophisticated capability to control hospital infection and public health [17] , and a real-time outbreak and disaster surveillance system which was utilized for early detection of disease outbreaks [18] .

In order to integrate isolated information systems which support communications for public health labs, the clinical community, and state and local health departments and to capitalize on the potential for a cross-fertilization of data exchange, some national level projects have been implemented in the US for early detection of public health threats. The Public Health Information Network (PHIN) is a framework created by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on defined data and vocabulary standards and strong collaborative relationships, the PHIN will enable consistent exchange of response, health, and disease tracking data between public health partners. The PHIN is composed of five key components: detection and monitoring, data analysis, knowledge management, alerting, and response. Other federal initiatives include: (1) the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) which is an initiative that promotes the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels [19] , (2) the BioNet which is a national network of public health laboratories and federal food regulatory agencies helping the CDC to rapidly detect and determine possible links between disease agents during terrorist attacks [20] , and (3) the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) which is an initiative set forth to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and overall quality of health and health care in the US, a comprehensive knowledge-based network of interoperable systems, and the set of technologies, standards, applications, systems, values, and laws that support all facets of individual health, health care, and public health [21] . The commonalties of these national level initiatives are the focus on data integration and standardization which intends to facilitate the information sharing among various healthcare partners and enables early detection of public health threats.

Prior research has addressed various issues related to the design of public health emergency response information systems. An integrated disease surveillance framework has been proposed for rapidly detecting, tracking, and managing public health threats [22] , which contains six functions: data collection, detection, alert and early warning, resource planning, response assessment and evaluation, and investigation and modeling. Another public health emergency response system was proposed as a decentralized model which gives states responsibility for collecting and disseminating all necessary information and co-ordinating surveillance and response [23] . According to this model, systems in different states must be compatible on the basis of common data standards so that the federal government can oversee a national network, and each state should cope with emergencies at a micro-level. In addition, some researchers contended that state and local health departments should build dual-or multiple-use public health information infrastructure [24] , suggesting that the public health information system should be able to respond and detect not only bioterrorism, but also other infectious disease outbreaks, chemical spills or leakages, food and water contamination scenarios, and animal disease outbreaks.

Based on experiences of the ''Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index'' (EMISARI) at the Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP), Turoff [25] asserts that ''an emergency system must be viewed as a structured group communication system where the protocols and communication structures are provided, but there is little content about a particular crisis situation except as an integrated electronic library of external data and information sources'' (p. 30). As a consequence, the design of emergency information systems should focus on the group communication process by accommodating how humans collect, contribute, and utilize data in a time-urgent manner [25] . Given that Turoff's remark is about generic emergency response information system, it is applicable to public health emergency response. It suggests that public health emergency response information systems can also be viewed as structured group communication systems. Turoff et al. [26] have articulated five criteria for the design of such a group communication system: metaphors, roles, notifications, context visibility, and hypertext. Metaphors, which pertain to the interface design, are the mental models of the system that help users to create a cognitive map between task objectives and interface elements. Roles reflect various parties' responsibilities in an event, and this concept should be built into the design of the group communication system by offering specific privileges and tools to different users. Notifications are relevant alerts to a user of change in status, data, or other information. The group communication system should raise appropriate notifications when events or actions of other users take place to cause the change. Context visibility refers to the idea that the components of the meaningful data objects are presented in a context that relates to the understandings of the user, that is, when the user activates a certain object the system should be able to know the user's intention and provide a list of relevant action choices. Hypertext refers to ''the possibility of multiple two way linkages with semantic meanings that allowed a person to utilize any item in the content of the application as a set of menu alternatives to move to another content or functionalities in the interface'' [26] . The criteria recommended by Turoff et al. assume the existence of communications networks and computing technologies and focuses on the software and interface design features.

The previous studies have provided insights into public health emergency systems. However, they are almost solely based on experiences in the U.S. Few papers examine the initiatives in public health emergency systems in developing countries. Given the important role China plays in the global public health arena, an investigation of China's public health emergency information systems will significantly contribute to the existing knowledge of public health emergency response.

Given the complexity of China' PHERIS and the lack of previous research on this topic, a case research method was employed by this study. Interviews with two professors at Health Science Center of Beijing University, three healthcare informatics experts, and six healthcare IT practitioners were conducted to collect data of the development of China's PHERIS. Additional documents were reviewed to retrieve pertinent information. These documents include government IT policies and regulations, meeting minutes, reports, development plans, media reports, and news. The credibility of the governmental documents is guaranteed, since they were either obtained from government officials or downloaded from official government websites. The quality of media reports and news is likely to be questionable. Nevertheless, this is not considered a problem, since the triangulation method was employed in this study. Triangulation is a widely accepted case research method which requires collecting data from multiple information sources and posits that multi-source data will corroborate each other and increase validity [27] . Using the triangulation method, we only included in this article the information that appeared consistently in multiple sources and discarded the conflicting information. In addition, the manuscript of this paper was reviewed by a leading health informatics researcher in China who has worked with China's central government on major public health information technology initiatives, including the PHERIS project. His review has largely ensured the validity of this paper by verifying the information gathered from interviews and non-governmental sources, such as media reports and news. The rest of this paper is mainly based on the analysis of the data we collected from interviews and documents.

China's public health information system (PHIS) has a hierarchical structure consisting of four layers: county layer, city layer, province layer, and cen-tral government layer. The primary objectives of the system are disease surveillance and monitoring. Major public health data collected by the system include epidemic report, disease surveillance, causes of death statistics, food hygiene, environment hygiene, school hygiene, women and children hygiene, profession hygiene, and public health resources allocation. The outbreak and spread of SARS have uncovered five deficiencies inherent in the PHIS, which are described as follows.

The disease reporting and surveillance have not been carried out in a timely manner. Due to the hierarchical structure of China's PHIS, disease surveillance data are reported by following a bottom-up path and the reporting is performed on a 10-day or monthly basis. Despite the establishment of a virtual private network in 2000 for electronically transmitting disease surveillance data among the four layers of the PHIS, communication between the PHIS and the sites where source public health data are collected is carried out through snail mail or telephone. In addition, surveillance reports have to be approved by relevant officials at each layer before they can move up to the next layer. As a result, the reporting cycle time is prolonged and local officials' interference could affect the accuracy of the reports. During the SARS event, it took 8-9 days on average to report a SARS case from the patient's location to the MOH, and 3-4 days to report a diagnosed SARS case from hospitals to the MOH. The delayed reporting has largely contributed to the rampancy of SARS in China.

The coverage of the PHIS is relatively small. The network of the PHIS comprises a variety of centers of disease control and prevention (CDC) which are at the county level and levels above. Although, these organizations are able to shape a national net on which public health information can be exchanged in real time, the mesh size of this net is too big to catch timely disease information. Health care organizations at the grassroots level are usually the sites where public health emergency occurs, however, these organizations are not part of the PHIS network.

The information flow in care providing organizations is inefficient. Should a public health emergency occurs, it is critical to gather accurate information regarding exploitable medical resources, such as hospital beds available, transportation capability, physicians available, care giving capability, medi-cal devices and equipments, medications, and preventive equipments, so that the emergency situation can be managed to the maximum. Due to the inefficient inter-organizational information sharing in China's hospitals as well as the inefficient communication between hospitals and disease control organizations, the admission and transfer of SARS patients during the SARS event was chaotic.

The public health regulatory system is insufficient. In China, only a few regions have established regulations to mandate and monitor the development and use of public health information systems. There are no unified regulations at the national level to enforce the exploitation of IS in disease surveillance and public health.

There is no standardized national platform for public health information exchange. China did recognize the importance of standard building, but little progress has been made on the development of health data standards, coding schemes, and communication protocols. Although, information systems have been widely used in the health care providers, disease control and prevention organizations, and health management authorities, the implementation initiatives are largely piecemeal, and lack a unified framework. As a consequence, health information is confined inside boundaries of these entities and effective health information sharing could not be easily realized due to the nonexistence of a standardized platform.

In order to be able to better manage future public health emergencies, China's central government has called for the establishment of a public health emergency information system (PHERIS) within 3 years. The PHERIS development project encompasses three phases. The first phase, which ended at the end of 2003, mainly aimed to meet the requirements of dealing with SARS and to build the foundation for the future development of public health information systems. During this phase, CDCs and health care organizations at the county level or above and some health care organizations at the village level have deployed SARS reporting systems and established SARS clinical examination and alert systems. The SARS reporting system is a secure Web-based application which allows users to report SARS cases electronically to a central database. In addition, the disease surveillance system and the command center were designed in this phase and preparations were made to roll out these systems. The second phase is planned to finish at the end of 2004. One of the major objectives in this phase is to build a national computer network infrastructure to support public health data exchange. A five-level computer network will be constructed to connect health administrative agencies, CDCs, and health care organizations at the national, province, city, county, and village levels. Another major objective of the second phase is to complete the development of the disease surveillance system so that the online reporting system not only covers SARS but all types of public health emergencies. Moreover, the second phase also intends to develop some national public health databases which can be used as knowledge bases for healthcare providers when they encounter public health emergencies, and to start and partially complete the development of the command center. The third phase is planned to complete at the end of 2005. The objective of this phase is to complete all the tasks of the development of PHERIS and realize information sharing and co-ordination among relevant organizations so that the public health emergency can be handled efficiently and effectively.

According to the MOH, public health emergencies refer to events that occur unexpectedly and can cause or potentially cause mass destruction to the public health. The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and 

The fundamental technical features of PHERIS are described from two aspects: data and network. Six databases need to be created to support the functioning of PHERIS: (1) geographic and natural environment database, (2) national socioeconomics database, (3) national public health risk factor database, (4) national morbidity and mortality database, (5) national emergency resources database, and (6) natural disaster database. Table 1 shows the content of each database. The data collected for PHERIS are heterogeneous. They are of a wide range of types, such as socioeconomics, humanity, hydrology, meteorology, environment, natural disaster, and health care. They could be numbers, texts, figures or pictures, and they could be real time data or historical data. Data from various sources will be integrated under the Microsoft .NET framework. From the network aspect, a ''five-layer and three-level'' network structure will be developed as the underlying infrastructure for PHERIS. The five layers refer to CDCs, health administrative agencies, and healthcare organizations at the levels of: (1) villages and towns, (2) counties and districts, (3) prefectures and cities, (4) provinces, and (5) nation. They are connected to the national public data network by broadband fiber lines, digital microwave, satellite communications, modem, and public telephone systems, thus forming a public health information virtual environment. The choice of communication method depends on the financial capability of different areas. The three levels refer to the establishment of major public health intranets at the city (or prefecture), province, and national level. A hierarchical star topology results from this network structure, where many villages and counties connecting to one city center, many cities connecting to one provincial center, and many provinces connecting to the national center. Fig. 2 depicts the topology. In addition, the provincial and city intranets provide network services and data services to public health related local organizations and form various community public health information networks.

Conceptually, PHERIS can be viewed as a composition of four major components: (1) a surveillance system, (2) a command center, (3) an action system, and (4) a supporting system. Fig. 3 illustrates relationships among these four components and their functional characteristics. The surveillance system captures public health emergencies and reports to the command center which assesses the emergency, raises alert, and makes decisions to respond to the emergency. The action system obtains orders from the command center and carries out the emergency response. The supporting system serves as a compulsory force to ensure all the activities of public health emergency response are undertaken properly. Lessons learned during and after a public health emergency will be incorporated into the knowledge body of improving PHERIS and reflected in future emergency detection and response.

The objective of the surveillance system is to replace the periodic manual reporting with online reporting to meet the requirements of emergency alert and response. A standard national public health emergency reporting platform with an underlying central database was implemented. Starting from 2004, authorized reporting individuals and organizations can perform online reporting, and health administrative agencies and CDCs will be able to download reports of local epidemic events and public emergencies in real time. In order to facilitate public health surveillance, CDCs at the city and county levels will develop infectious disease databases and public health risk factor databases. Regular updates will be made to these databases on the basis of surveillance reports and epidemiological investigations. Given that many Chinese health care workers lack the ability to use computers, personnel training will be carried out along with the development of the surveillance system. The surveillance system is primarily an innovation of online reporting. The implementation of this innovation radically reengineered China's former public health surveillance process by removing many intermediate stops that the public health emergency data had to go through, thus resulting in a much more efficient process.

The command center integrates public health, disease surveillance, medical care, and health regulation information by using the network platform. It intends to utilize the advanced information technology to provide critical information to a central commander team so that appropriate decisions can be made to deal with public health emergencies. The system will monitor the entire process of the emergency and has such functionalities as data collection, crisis determination, decision support, command, deployment, real time communication, and onsite support. The purpose is to make the most appropriate response to the emergency in the shortest time so that available resources can be effectively and efficiently allocated and exploited. The systems in command center encompass three application platforms and seven subsystems. The three application platforms are information platform, professional service platform, and decision making platform. The seven subsystems include database subsystem, geographic information subsystem, remote monitor subsystem, analysis and prediction subsystem, virtual reality subsystem, decision support subsystem, and search engine subsystem. Since, the command center is the central component of PHERIS, the three platforms and seven subsystems are described in more details in the following two paragraphs.

The information platform consists of the development of computer software and hardware, telecommunications infrastructure, data collection system, and data warehouses. The data collection system utilizes various technologies to capture images, graphs, statistical data, professional data, public health surveillance data, and textual data. Data storage technologies include both centralized and distributed database management models. The professional service platform is the core of the command center. Employing simulation techniques, this platform builds models to analyze the spreading processes of various infectious diseases. This exercise is largely based on the disease model database, the methodology database, and the public health knowledge base. The decision making platform is the presentation layer of the command center. All the activities involved in the public health emergency response, which includes monitoring, analyzing, investigating, predicting, decision-making, executing, and getting feedbacks, are carried out at this layer.

The seven subsystems provide technical support to the three application platforms. As shown in Fig. 4: (1) the database subsystem, the geographic information subsystem, and the remote monitor subsystem supply data to the information platform, (2) the analysis and prediction subsystem and the virtual reality subsystem serve the professional service platform, and (3) the decision support subsystem and the search engine subsystem offer services to the decision making platform. The three platforms and the seven subsystems need to share information or exchange data on a regular basis. They are integrated together to support the public health emergency response and their performances are related with each other. It should be noted that China is interested in leveraging the virtual reality technology to display the spreading process of infectious diseases in three dimensional images, to model possible outcomes of emergency response decisions, and to simulate plans of medical resource allocation in the event of an emergency. The design of the virtual reality subsystem will continuously evolve given that the application of virtual reality in public health largely remains an open research filed.

The action system is an important component of PHERIS. It is related to healthcare provision, emergency rescuing, and CDC institutions. In the event of a public health emergency, the action system will report relevant information to the command center and execute orders from the command center to allocate medical resources, such as hospital beds, medications, medical rescuing equipments, telemedicine services, long distance training, and other healthcare services. Under normal circumstances, this system is utilized to manage public health, provide medical services, facilitate emergency room services, and conduct telemedicine and other health activities. The action system plays different roles in the ''peace time'' and the ''war time.''

The supporting system is primarily a public health regulatory information system. The purpose of this system is to monitor the behavior of health care administrative agencies and healthcare organizations in fulfilling their legal obligation of protecting public health. The supporting system requires the establishment of public health regulatory LANs and central databases at the provincial and national levels. All the public health administrative agencies need to connect to the two LANs through the national public data network. The standardized format of regulatory reports will be developed. In terms of data communication of legal issues, online reporting and digital data collection methods are not in place but will be created.

This article provides an insight into the challenges currently facing China's public health and describes the development of PHERIS to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. China recognizes that surveillance and detection of disease outbreaks is a critical part of the solution and a dynamic system incorporating command, action, and supporting components is also needed to manage emergencies. The ongoing development of PHERIS will provide a complete package for China to rapidly detect emergencies, effectively share critical information among key stakeholders, and competently manage emergencies. Comparing PHERIS with the five criteria recommended by Turoff et al. [26] , we find that the concepts of roles and notifications have been partly built into the system, while metaphors, context visibility, and hypertext are hardly realized in the system. This is not surprising, since China just started developing PHERIS and the system is still relatively rudimentary. At this stage, China's effort in developing PHERIS can be considered to be successful because of the radical emergency response process change re-sulted from PHERIS and its associated performance improvement in public health surveillance and group co-ordination. China expects PHERIS to be an adaptable system which is able to adjust to the changing environment. Thus, PHERIS will play a significant role in protecting China's public health for years to come. In summary, this article contributes to the IS literature with a description of China's PHERIS development and should be beneficial to both IS researchers and practitioners, especially those who are interested in developing countries' public health emergency response information systems.

Pandemic H1N1 in Canada and the use of evidence in developing public health policies e A policy analysis,"When responding to a novel infectious disease outbreak, policies are set under time constraints and uncertainty which can limit the ability to control the outbreak and result in unintended consequences including lack of public confidence. The H1N1 pandemic highlighted challenges in public health decision-making during a public health emergency. Understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences is important to improve the response to future emergencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (JulyeNovember 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility. A more transparent and iterative approach to incorporating evidence into public health decision-making that reflects the realities of the external pressures present during a public health emergency is needed.","An effective public health response to a novel infectious disease will reduce the population impact. However, time constraints and uncertainty can compromise the response. This was seen with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak where policies were developed under scientific uncertainty due to lack of published evidence and limited experience with the virus (MacDougall, 2007) . Some have suggested this uncertainty contributed to the failure to optimally control the outbreak in a timely manner in certain highly affected locations and resulted in unintended consequences such as lack of public confidence (National Advisory Commitee on SARS and Public Health, 2003) . Given the history of serious pandemic influenza outbreaks and the emergence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, concerns about a human influenza pandemic are paramount. As a result several governments and institutions have implemented extensive pandemic plans to be better prepared and minimize uncertainty.

On June 11, 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert to its highest phase in response to a novel strain of H1N1 influenza (Eurosurveillance editorial team, 2009). Despite extensive planning, the use of evidence to develop policies was complicated by several factors. Public health officials had to make decisions quickly, often when information was still being gathered. Coordination was necessary across multiple levels of public health (international, federal, provincial, local) and sectors (hospitals, schools, workplaces) . Finally, pandemic policymaking has been shown to be influenced by political factors (Garoon & Duggan, 2008) and can be strained by antiviral and vaccine shortages, overwhelming demands on public health systems and intense public scrutiny (Timpka et al., 2009) .

This study sought to examine the Canadian public health system response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1). Our objective was to analyse the public health decision-making process and identify the factors that influenced the uptake and application of evidence for public health policy decisions.

This policy analysis used a multiple case study design to examine policies at the federal, provincial and local levels of public health in Canada. Four policies were studied: (a) vaccine priority, (b) use of adjuvanted vaccine among pregnant women, (c) school closures as a containment strategy, and (d) recommendations on N95 respirators as a form of personal protective equipment (PPE) ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) .

Study participants were from five Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia). An initial list of 41 key informants was developed by identifying officials in federal, provincial or municipal governments, provincial or local medical officers of health, members of a pH1N1 scientific advisory group, and clinical experts in infectious diseases and/or public health. A snowball sampling method was then used to identify an additional 23 participants. We initiated recruitment by email between July and September 2010 and all interviews were complete by November 2010. All consenting participants were given the choice on the policy of focus for the interview based on their role/ responsibility during the pandemic. Many participants were involved in multiple policies and some spoke to more than one during their interview. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto, Canada. All participants provided written informed consent.

The semi-structured interview guide was developed to capture the decision-making process with a focus on the use of evidence. All interviews were conducted by telephone by the principal investigator (LC) or research assistant (JT), recorded and transcribed verbatim. A second analyst (AC), present for all interviews, took additional notes and independently verified all transcriptions.

We sought public documents that detailed a pH1N1 policy recommendation related to the four policies. Primary documents included: guidance documents, statements of recommendations, interim or final government, advisory or scientific group reports and pandemic plans. Secondary documents included: information sheets, surveillance bulletins, journal publications and references from primary documents. Documents outlining recommendations were limited to those released between April 1, 2009 and May 31, 2010 while other documents were restricted to those released up to December 31, 2010. These date restrictions were in place to keep the analyses focused on pH1N1 and were determined by those responsible for monitoring these documents during the pandemic. Documents were identified through a search of an archive of published and grey literature related to pH1N1. Librarians developed this archive by performing daily local, national and international scans (www.ophla.ca). In addition, a direct search of selected public health and governmental websites was performed.

Data coding was used to abstract and synthesize data from transcribed interviews and policy documents using descriptive and iterative methods (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Yin, 1994) . We used Lomas' model for decision-making (Lomas, 2000) to guide the analysis because it captures the interactive and multidirectional knowledge transfer that occurs in the decision-making process focussing on both evidence or knowledge and its transfer within a Research studies had yet to show the significance of airborne (in addition to droplet) transmission for pandemic influenza Studies emerged that raised doubts on the ability of N95 respirators to prevent transmission of influenza among HCWs N95 respirators were recommended pandemic plans policy subsystem ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It also emphasizes the importance of context-based decision-making incorporating three domains that influence the process: values, institutions and information.

We also considered Sabatier's advocacy coalition framework (ACF) as it similarly emphasizes beliefs and ideologies (Sabatier, 2007) . However, this framework is less effective in describing the role of institutions. Dobrow's context and evidence utilization framework (Dobrow, Goel, & Upshur, 2004) is well-suited for examining contextual factors influencing the uptake of evidence, but has limited application to the policy and institutional subsystems where decisions take place, which was critical for pH1N1.

We also allowed thematic content to evolve independently of Lomas' framework. The principal investigator (the primary rater) developed the coding guide based on the framework and adaptations from its use in a previous analysis (Wilson et al., 2007) . The interviews were distributed between the primary and secondary rater for independent coding. A subset of transcriptions was coded by both raters to evaluate inter-rater differences. In addition, the primary rater reviewed all transcripts and coding a final time to ensure consistency. A similar process was followed for the document analysis. We reviewed coded data for themes guided by the research objectives and domains in Lomas' framework as well as themes that emerged that were not part of the framework. NVivo 9 was used to assist with data collection, organization and analysis.

We conducted 40 interviews, including six pilot interviews, and included all in the analysis. The primary roles of participants during pH1N1 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . Seventy-six relevant documents were identified with 12 covering more than one policy (Supplementary Table 3 ). We present our findings according to the Lomas framework and generalize themes overall, providing specific examples within policies in Table 2 .

Three competing ideologies emerged with respect to the use of evidence: (1) the evidence-based ideology: science should be the first and foremost consideration in developing policies, and decisions made in the absence of good quality evidence can result in suboptimal policies; (2) the policy-based ideology: science is a minor component of the policymaking process and evidence is meant to inform policy rather than drive policy; and, (3) a hybrid or pragmatist ideology. Most participants associated the term evidence with the traditional research-based form of scientific evidence, which were primarily epidemiological in nature.

With a perspective derived from evidence-based medicine (EBM), participants with an evidence-based ideology placed considerable value on the peer-review process associated with scientific publications and conventional epidemiological study designs. Without a peer-review process, this group felt uneasy with proceeding to a policy decision. Furthermore, participants expressed frustration when science was re-evaluated in the policy arena, believing this compromises an evidence-based approach. Their key view is that evidence should be central and at the basis of any good public health policy decision, and that good evidence leads to good policy.

""[Information on public health measures] are published in grey literature or as evaluations or reports that were implemented. It's hard to trust in the same way because it's not peer-reviewed and not subjected to the same rigor."" (participant 25, scientific advisor)

This ideology ran into a major barrier when particular standards of evidence were deemed necessary to proceed. For example, the use of adjuvanted vaccine had not been shown to be harmful in pregnant women, but advisory groups had difficulty offering conclusive advice without evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in pregnant women.

""The largest and most glaring gap was data on vaccine in pregnancy. That's a major issue that we still haven't solved. we end up using vaccines and other things in pregnant women yet we exclude them from the clinical trials where they would provide the data on their safety and effectiveness."" (participant 40, scientific advisor)

In contrast, participants with the policy-based ideology shared the perspective that evidence is meant to only inform policy and not dictate policy. Under certain circumstances, they believed it was justified to give less priority to science in favour of other contextual issues. Participants with this ideology felt that scientists often lack expertise in policy-making. This ideology acknowledges that personal belief and ability to sway individuals also play important roles. Furthermore, the group stressed that the purely science-based approach over-simplifies the reality of developing policies since the determining factors were often contextual.

""in a way you generate knowledge that's no use to the field because it's inapplicable even though the science is very appropriate. you're out of touch with the evidence mapping the policy."" (participant 69, public health official) ""In my view scientific advice into that [N95] decision would not have changed anything."" (participant 02, scientific advisor)

The pragmatist ideology can be seen as the centre of the continuum between evidence and policy-based ideologies. The participants who adopted this ideology felt science should be a primary consideration, but other factors including expert advice, clinical factors, logistics and ethics can be equally important and should be ""respected."" This group was more likely to have an openview of what constitutes evidence and tended not to make broad brush statements about either evidence or policy considerations, accepting that science can trump other considerations if compelling enough and vice versa. This group felt comfortable acting on the best available evidence and recognized that reaching consensus with respect to the science is often not possible.

"".science is a tool. We can debate the science for years but we have to make the best decision given the circumstance."" (participant 13, public health official) ""The decision-makers were all fully aware of the evidence and I think in a perfect environment would have chosen not to recommend the N95 masks. But they were working in the face of political and legal commitments as per the collective agreement. The evidence was available. It was considered but other factors ultimately drove the decision."" (participant 45, scientific advisor) ""Implementation considerations really are an incredibly important. confidence and public communication considerations are also really important considerations. They need to be respected every bit as much as the scientific and evidentiary considerations."" (participant 04, public health official)

Having not agreed upon definition of evidence results in further challenges in determining what counts as an evidence-based decision. While many participants support the pragmatic thinking, they recognize that current decision-making bodies lack the models to guide this in practice in a defensible way. In the current model, science evaluation and advisory recommendations are independent of decision-making. This separation has been recognized as essential to maintaining scientific integrity (Black, 2001) and is consistent with the evidence-based ideology. In situations where there was a lack of evidence, such as for the adjuvanted vaccine, it was difficult to proceed using an evidence-based ideology; therefore, other values and influences, such as the precautionary principle became of greater importance.

""It's another great example of the corner you get yourself into when you start making decisions that are not evidence-based. I mean the original decision to suggest that pregnant women should receive non-adjuvant vaccine, there was no evidentiary basis for that at all. It was one of these sort of theoretical precautionary principle sorts of things."" (participant 47, public health official)

""you can always say we'll take the precautionary principle and let's just play it absolutely safe and just go with the non-adjuvant, even though it may be less effective and it was not available."" (participant 19, clinical expert)

In a pandemic there is uncertainty at the outset. As a result, prior beliefs on epidemiological patterns were very influential. Beliefs were well entrenched because pandemic planning has been an ongoing public health effort for several years. Beliefs were most strong with respect to disease severity, health care burden and transmission. Severity was expected to be moderate to severe, having the epidemiological characteristics of previous pandemics, particularly the 1968 Asian flu pandemic or seasonal influenza (Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 2008). Participants also referenced the 1918e19 pandemic, avian influenza and SARS, indicating that historical memory played an important role in influencing beliefs. The health care burden was assumed to be high, having major resource implications and occupational safety concerns for health care workers. Transmission was assumed to occur through droplet spread with the possibility of airborne transmission. During pH1N1, emerging evidence that did not support these beliefs was more difficult to accept or incorporate into decision-making.

""One of the key considerations related to the N95 issue was the fact that we already had a pre-existing policy in place. that we would recommend that health care workers use N95 or the equivalent for protection. So you're not going to suddenly mid-gear change your policy."" (participant 04, public health official) ""trying to change the way you respond during a time of crisis is very difficult."" (participant 51 , public health practitioner)

Many participants felt that as pH1N1 progressed, attention was not paid to the severity of the disease soon enough and the subsequent scaling down of events to match the severity was delayed.

""we operated the same, whether or not it was a severe pandemic or not."" (participant 57, public health practitioner) ""We shouldn't have a war plan and stick with it right through to the bitter end, which I think is what we did this time. I actually don't know how you titre up or titre down but probably it's packaged with how we're communicating so that there is some room to move back if the threat is less severe than you initially worried about."" (participant 38, scientific advisor)

Beliefs were also entrenched as a result of the SARS experience, despite SARS being a hospital-outbreak versus the pH1N1 community outbreak. The impact of SARS on health care workers influenced beliefs about the severity of H1N1 and how we should prepare and respond.

""Maybe over a long period of time and as things like SARS become more distant in the memories of people working in health care that might change things."" (participant 43, clinical expert)

Several competing interests factored into the use of evidence. Health care unions were interested in protecting their workers. Professional medical societies were interested in the population they serve (e.g. Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) for children, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) for pregnant women and educational boards needed to consider both parents and school employees). Scientific advisors were tasked with evaluating the science and providing an unbiased recommendation while staying true to the quality of the science and the needs of the overall population versus specific subpopulations. Policymakers in governmental institutions were faced with balancing these and several other interests. At different jurisdictional levels in Canada, provincial and local level decision-makers needed to balance science with the overall needs and contextual factors in their community.

""When we were looking at the dosage and the number of vaccines that needed to be given to children. both the pediatricians and the public health position were based on defensible science. But the same science was interpreted differently by the two groups depending on whether their major concern was for the one individual child in front of them or whether it was in terms of how many kids could we vaccinate in how short a period of time to give a population level of protection."" (participant 32, public health official)

""we compromised on the N95s because we felt okay, so it's better to have masks used potentially unnecessarily but actually have people willing to come to work rather than risk people refusing to come to work."" (participant 32, public health official)

The complexity of Canada's executive, legislative and bureaucratic structures of public health complicated the policy process. This complexity has been noted previously to influence public health (Frank & Di Ruggiero, 2003) . With multiple levels of action, participants reported signs of disconnect between those responsible for reviewing the evidence and those exercising decisions in their respective jurisdictions. In addition, participants stated that recommendations made at the international or national level often did not consider local issues. Internationally, the WHO and US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) were highly influential.

""the vaccine decision-making process was very complex because it involved multiple levels of public health from WHO, to PHAC, to the province and then down to the local health unit."" (participant 45, scientific advisor)

Informal institutional structures were also influential. Pandemic H1N1 was the focus of intense interest and pressure from multiple citizen and advocacy groups, particularly in relation to vaccination. Pandemic plans, recommendations from the WHO and decisions made in other countries also affected how evidence was used in Canada.

""Full consideration has been given to international activities and declarations and notices issued by the World Health Organization."" (Health Canada, 9 A.D.) ""The fact that some other jurisdictions, such as Mexico and the US, implemented measures such as school closures put more pressure on Ontario to adopt similar measures."" (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, 2010)

Information producers included scientists/researchers, advisory groups and committees/working groups. Participants frequently expressed uncertainty about who was responsible for answering what questions. This resulted in confusion on where to look for information, particularly when differing recommendations were based on the same evidence.

Information purveyors included: government, professional organizations, media and advisory organizations with and without decision-making capability at local, provincial, federal and international levels. A common theme was that the credibility of information purveyors was paramount and needed to be preestablished. Scientific advisory groups formed during pH1N1 did not have the opportunity to establish their credibility, making their recommendations difficult to accept. For example, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is responsible for scientific guidance on immunizations; however, another vaccine advisory group was created specifically for the pandemic and NACI not consulted until later on.

""It's no good having a scientific decision-making body that only exists in the setting of emergencies or one that is sufficiently far from government that they're not looking at that advice and using that advice on a regular basis."" (participant 02, scientific advisor) Credibility also posed challenges at times because recommendations coming from an established and credible organization were difficult to challenge or modify (i.e. WHO). Along with credibility, themes emerged around the challenges in achieving consensus on scientific evidence. Participants were particularly concerned about the significant amount of time spent trying to achieve consensus, commenting that long debates over scientific merits under time constraints is not helpful. It was recognized that consensus is often not feasible and therefore, different models of consensus should be considered.

""a cabinet approach, which is that you may disagree with the final decision but you go with it and you live with it."" (participant 18, public health official)

When contradictory or unclear messages were given, the ensuing confusion resulted in decreased public confidence and increased time invested to rationalize the differences.

""[WHO] made a recommendation that pregnant women should be offered non-adjuvant vaccine preferentially because there wasn't much data on the use of adjuvant, or so they claimed, in pregnant women, which set the tone for Canada. we had already ordered adjuvant vaccine for our population. So that was a bit of a challenge for us."" (participant 04, public health official) ""The untimely and ambiguous recommendations for dosing in pregnant women and young children from national and international sources put Alberta in a vulnerable position where credibility of its public health decision-makers was jeopardized because of issues beyond their control."" (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2010) One of the most influential information purveyors, the media, was looked at in an overall favourable light. Unlike previous public health events, such as SARS where the media reaction was sensationalized and disruptive at times (Lewison, 2008; Washer, 2004) , participants felt that most of the time the media took a balanced and responsible approach in their reporting by seeking appropriate advice from credible experts.

""I don't think the media drove any of our policies, other than forcing us to try and be as clear in our communications as possible."" (participant 32 , public health official) However, at certain points during the pandemic, such as around the immunization campaign, it was perceived that media coverage did have a strong influence.

""initially [the media] influenced the public perception of the vaccine. Originally it was in a negative way so that there were questions to the safety and the need for the vaccine. But then subsequently after the death of [child], it was for demand of the vaccine. Then all of the media attention on the lines and the long waiting times just added public pressure to go beyond the priority groups that were determined by the policy."" (participant 41, scientific advisor)

Academic journals were also cited as an influential purveyor. Study participants acknowledged that journals made an attempt to speed up their review and publishing of pandemic studies and made articles freely available. Nonetheless, the process was critiqued by some who commented that at times it disrupted the flow of information.

""there wasn't an awful lot of science being published about pandemic H1N1 in a timely enough fashion to affect decision-making. . So it would be really good to have a fast track peel-off kind of system of public access where people can review and it doesn't necessarily preclude subsequent publication .. because scientists need to be able to do that."" (participant 32, public health official)

Views on the sufficiency of information were divergent. Many participants expressed the desire for more information/evidence despite an acknowledgement that decision-makers may not be equipped to handle new or emerging information, even if the scientific quality is high.

Several additional themes emerged that were not explicitly captured by the Lomas framework. Comments on the use of evidence revealed concerns around transparency (i.e. operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed) and explicitness (policies fully and clearly expressed, leaving nothing implied). Specifically, because criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of evidence were unclear, decision-making structures themselves were described by participants as being a mystery at times. Some participants not at the decision-making table were not confident in their ability to accept and implement recommendations because they were not privy to the decision-making structure. Scientific advisors wanted to know how scientific recommendations provided were ultimately used and balanced with other factors. If advice was not explicitly referenced, those providing the scientific advice assumed it was not considered. Some felt that decision-makers often do not cite other factors, such as logistical, political and social issues as rationales because those issues are perceived as less justifiable compared to science. This lack of explicitness can result in the unintended consequence of decisions appearing to be made without appropriate justification.

""There wasn't a lot of transparency in those decisions or at least feedback to the people who were making the recommendations. It's hard to know whether they also considered the evidence. or whether there were some other factors that were forcing them to go against the recommendation."" (participant 25, scientific advisor)

A clear documentation of the process would serve to make the process more explicit and satisfy concerns raised.

""the bottom line is a decision has to be made. You have to sometimes go right down to consensus and expert opinion or extrapolation from other types of evidence or other categories of evidence to make your recommendation. I think there has to be rigor that goes along with that and documentation and clarity on the reasoning."" (participant 45, scientific advisor) Several participants commented on the multiple parallel processes which took place. Not only were there parallel processes for decision-making at multiple levels, but the generation/evaluation of evidence also happened at multiple levels and sometimes even within the same jurisdiction or institution. Such duplication contributed to inefficiencies and confusion in the recommendations.

""all of us were scrambling across all of our different domains to understand as best as we could what could be learned at any given moment. In retrospect it was so fundamentally inefficient."" (participant 16, scientific advisor) Participants noted that First Nations groups were at increased risk of mortality and morbidity and warranted vaccine priority, but overall did not speculate on the broader causes of the disproportionate mortality and morbidity. This issue was not the focus of the study or the policies examined, which could be an explanation for why this was not discussed in more detail by the participants.

In contrast to previous public health events such as SARS (National Advisory Commitee on SARS and Public Health, 2003) , the CreutzfeldteJakob disease tainted blood scandal (Wilson et al., 2001) and the Walkerton Escherichia coli outbreak (Schuster et al., 2005) , a unique aspect of pH1N1 was the advance planning. Substantial investments had been made in pandemic planning since SARS, and the identification of H1N1 in Mexico in early 2009 initiated further preparations for its anticipated spread. Advance planning did minimize uncertainty, but it also generated assumptions that created conflict when handling emerging evidence. Furthermore, evidence was interpreted differently according to the three ideologies of evidence.

According to Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of reasoned action, pandemic plans are manifestations of the intentions for a pandemic, a conscious action plan which functions as a major determinant of future behaviour (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) . Pandemic plans are a complex collection of assumptions based on various types of evidence. This creates a box in which policymaking begins and sometimes stays. As the outbreak unfolded it became apparent that data on severity did not match the models and underlying assumptions of most plans. Decision-making, however, continued to be framed by these models. Pandemic plans are intended to provide practical guidance and not indoctrinate ideology; however, this analysis shows that the latter prevailed. This finding is consistent with the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) which explains the difficulties in adjusting when there is a discrepancy between prior held beliefs and new information based on the existing situation.

Other decision-making theories can offer insight into policy choices made despite the evidence. Challenging the content of the pandemic plans, for example on the use of N95 respirators, was avoided in certain jurisdictions given the significant conflict that would arise. This is consistent with conflict avoidance as described by the conflict model of decision-making (Janis & Mann, 1977) . A decision that involves a potential conflict provokes a degree of stress, the excess or absence of which is in turn a major determinant of the final decision. The N95 decision in Ontario was a result of ""defensive avoidance"" such that the risks to labour disruption would not be worth challenging a recommendation from the pandemic plan. The school closure policy went against a priori guidance, which largely endorsed school closure as a containment strategy. According to the conflict model, the (largely societal) risks associated with school closures outweighed the risks of staying with the decision. These two policies contrast in how differences in antecedent conditions, available evidence and resulting decisionalconflict, guided the policy actions. It is possible that the nature of the situation, and not theory, explained the N95 decision as the political and non-evidentiary considerations were considered legitimate. Compared with N95, very little epidemiological evidence existed for school closures with support mostly coming from modelling studies. However, the potentially large societal costs of closing schools supported a change in direction. The vaccine sequencing decisions also largely agreed with pandemic plans although the manifestation of the policy was extremely heterogeneous across Canada and within provinces. With the adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, little to no a priori information existed and therefore cognitive dissonance did not apply. Instead, the precautionary principle was largely used to justify decisions.

There are some limitations to this study. As interviews were conducted a few months after the pandemic was declared over, recall bias is a possibility. Verification of our findings with the document analysis is not susceptible to this recall bias and supported similar themes around the role of beliefs, information purveyors and ideologies. Nonetheless we acknowledge that hindsight may influence responses. All participants work within the public health or health care system. As a result, the views of individuals outside the public health system were not represented. While this is appropriate given our research question, these findings represent only one particular stream of perspectives. One of the limitations of using the Lomas framework in this analysis is the unidirectional flow between information domains and institutional structures for decision-making. During pH1N1, this exchange was multidirectional and several individuals were both producers of information and decision-makers within the formal structures, making it difficult to conceptually separate their unique influences. Lomas' framework also does not capture Canada's hierarchical, jurisdictional and institutional levels of decision-making and their interactions. Finally, the placement of evidence ideology in the values component of the model can be questioned as it is reflective of a normative stance versus a value trait.

Rationalism demands that decision-makers choose the best alternative from a set of options (Betsch, Haberstroh, & Hohle, 2002) . However, under the congruence of multiple pre-planning and entrenched assumptions, the precautionary principle and evidence-based paradigms, a complex situation emerges whereby the decision-making process cannot be easily tracked or justified according to a straightforward set of criteria. Pre-planned approaches have many benefits including clarifying accountability and strategy during uncertainty. However, caution needs to be exercised when pre-planned approaches are in place to ensure policy options are not constrained by plans. We suggest that pandemic plans need to be written and used in a way that accommodates dynamic responses to fit an emerging situation. This includes minimizing scenarios based on single assumptions and conducting a range of sensitivity analyses.

An emergent public health situation that affects a large proportion of the population will necessarily require a balance between various factors. Both evidential and policy considerations are important and improvements in addressing both effectively and explicitly within decision-making processes are needed. We recommend an iterative scientific review that re-considers science/ evidence based on the policy landscape. The challenge with this approach is that in an EBM paradigm this can be thought of as compromising evidence. We have noted throughout our analysis that this is already happening; therefore, being more explicit about the process will allow for more critical investigation. Functionally, public health needs a model that can support these types of decision constructs, but at the same time ensure rigor. One modifiable construct that would be beneficial to amend going forward is to reconsider what constitutes evidence. This analysis suggests a more comprehensive and inclusive concept of evidence that recognizes the variety of contexts in which evidence is generated and used (Upshur, VanDenKerkhof, & Goel, 2001) , and that is more appropriate during an emerging public health event. This can be facilitated by increased collaboration and discussion among researchers and policymakers to ensure the relevant evidence is generated. Such collaborations would also facilitate greater credibility of information purveyors, which is particularly important when evidence does not fit prior expectations.

Credibility, transparency and explicitness in the decisionmaking process will improve understanding and uptake of policy decisions. In particular, our analyses revealed that when and why evidence/advice is or is not considered needs to be clearly articulated. This includes outlining steps, logic, key assumptions, limitations and trade-offs considered, evidentiary or otherwise. The role of ideological perspectives and prior beliefs should also be made explicit given how influential they are in defining decisions from the outset. We acknowledge that detailed recording of evidencebased or consensus-derived decisions to ensure transparency may be idealistic in the face of time and other pressures during a crisis. One possible recommendation could be a more rigorous use of Incident Management System (IMS) processes which would serve not only to improve processes but also to ensure better documentation. At the minimum, critical post-outbreak analyses of detailed real-time records of the meetings and transcripts should occur to improve future public health actions. Finally, with many different groups addressing the same questions, inefficiencies still exist. The public health system needs to leverage existing relationships rather than create new structures during a pandemic. In addition, better clarity on who is responsible for answering what questions is needed to avoid duplication and mixed messages. Addressing inefficiencies will require trust and collaboration, supporting the themes identified around credibility.

This analysis reflects the tension that occurs during emergency public health decision-making and highlights several important considerations for public health planning. Going forward, we must ensure that our decision-making structures evolve in light of the challenges experienced during pH1N1.

Public health human resources: a comparative analysis of policy documents in two Canadian provinces,"Background: Amidst concerns regarding the capacity of the public health system to respond rapidly and appropriately to threats such as pandemics and terrorism, along with changing population health needs, governments have focused on strengthening public health systems. A key factor in a robust public health system is its workforce. As part of a nationally funded study of public health renewal in Canada, a policy analysis was conducted to compare public health human resources-relevant documents in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), as they each implement public health renewal activities. Methods: A content analysis of policy and planning documents from government and public health-related organizations was conducted by a research team comprised of academics and government decision-makers. Documents published between 2003 and 2011 were accessed (BC = 27; ON = 20); documents were either publicly available or internal to government and excerpted with permission. Documentary texts were deductively coded using a coding template developed by the researchers based on key health human resources concepts derived from two national policy documents.","The increase in communicable and non-communicable disease incidence and prevalence, changing population demographics, along with concerns about pandemics, natural disasters, and terrorism, have highlighted the challenges faced by public health systems to respond rapidly and appropriately to threats [1, 2] . Governments, recognizing the importance of public health to address these threats, have focused on strengthening public health systems in many countries including Canada [3] , the United States [2] and across Europe [4] . A key factor in rebuilding and sustaining public health is a robust public health workforce. Improved public health human resources (PHHR) policy, planning, and management have been identified as priorities in international reports [3, 5] . In separate national public health priority setting consultations, both Canada and the United States have identified issues related to the public health workforce as priorities [6, 7] . Indeed '(no) attempt to improve public health will succeed that does not recognize the fundamental importance of providing and maintaining in every local health agency across Canada an adequate staff of highly skilled and motivated public health professionals' [3] (p. 136).

PHHR policy development and planning is complex and has a number of unique challenges. The myriad of sectors and stakeholders responsible for public health service delivery involve multiple levels of governmentnational, provincial/state, and localalong with sectors external to public health, such as primary care, schools, municipal governments, not-for-profit agencies and nongovernment organizations. The involvement of such a broad array of stakeholders poses challenges to coordination and planning for the right composition and distribution of PHHR [8, 9] . The public health workforce includes more than 25 regulated and non-regulated health care providers [10] . Because these providers are drawn from different disciplines (both health and nonhealth related), there is great variation in their entrylevel education. Indeed, most are prepared in generalist discipline-specific programmes with little formal public health education [9] adding more complexity to PHHR planning [11] .

In Canada, national consultations have identified a vision for PHHR that includes collaborative planning, building on core public health competencies that will result in a competent and flexible workforce prepared to ""meet the population's public health needs, and reduce health and social disparities"" [10] (p.iii). While national visions provide a collective direction for policy development and implementation, public health programmes are primarily developed and delivered at the provincial and local levels (for example, municipal, regional). To date, there has been little published about PHHR policy and planning at the provincial or local level and specifically during a time of change or renewal for public health systems. The purpose of this paper is to present results of an analysis of PHHR policy and planning documents for two provinces in Canada as they each implement public health renewal activities.

In Canada, public health is a shared responsibility between several levels of government. At the national level, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) provides national leadership for action on public health with roles in facilitating intergovernmental collaboration on public health and supporting national approaches to policy and planning [12] . While the PHAC collaborates with provincial, territorial, and municipal levels of government as well as non-government organizations, each province or territory has its own public health legislation [13, 14] and unique structure for public health service delivery.

In 2003, in the aftermath of the SARS event, two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), undertook processes to define, develop, and implement public health requirements for services and programmes. The result of these parallel but independent processes led to the BC Core Public Health Functions [15] and the Ontario Public Health Standards [16] . Each province has similar and unique public health contexts. For example, in BC, public health is funded by the provincial government and delivered by five regional health authorities and one provincial health authority while in Ontario funding is shared between the provincial government and municipal (local) governments and delivered by 36 local boards of health. In addition, in both provinces some provincial agencies participate in delivery of some services. See Table 1 for additional information on BC and ON public health context.

In this paper we report on results of a comparative policy analysis conducted within a larger programme of research. The aim of this policy analysis was to compare PHHR-relevant policies and planning documents in two Canadian provinces, BC and ON, as they each implement public health renewal activities.

The 'Renewal of Public Health Systems (RePHS) in BC and Ontario' is a five year nationally funded programme of research (2009 to 2014) [17] . The RePHS study seeks to answer two major research objectives:

1. To explore and understand the core public health functions implementation process and the contextual factors influencing it in BC and ON. 2. To examine and understand the impact and outcomes of core public health functions implementation at organizational, systems, and population levels in both BC and ON.

Three cross-cutting themes are also investigated in this study:

1. Public health human resources policy, planning, and management; 2. Relationships between public health and primary care sectors; and 3. Integration of an equity lens.

Together these objectives and cross-cutting themes guide an integrated programme of research. One aim of the RePHS study was to compare how each province articulated their provincial policy directions related to PHHR at the outset of this programme of research. The policy analysis reported in this paper will provide a baseline against which to compare PHHR developments at the conclusion of the RePHS programme of research.

Questions guiding this policy analysis were: What specific aspects of PHHR policy, planning, and management are discussed in BC and ON government and public health organization documents? What are the contexts in which PHHR policy, planning, and management are discussed? and To what extent are these similar/ different?

A comparative policy analysis of documents in BC and ON was conducted to understand key aspects of PHHR policy and planning during implementation of public health renewal activities. We defined policy as those 'courses of action (and inaction) that affect the set of institutions, organizations, services and funding arrangements of the health and health care system. It includes policy made in the public sector (by government) as well as in the private sector' [18] (p. 6). Policy analysis is the systematic and disciplined examination of policy with the objective of understanding the process, content, or outcomes of policy [18, 19] . In this analysis we were interested in analysing the content of PHHR-relevant policy and planning documents within the context of change in public health. The research team consisted of academic researchers and government decision-makers with public health expertise in both provinces; team members are also investigators on the larger RePHS study.

For the purposes of this study, we included provincial government and select public health organizations' policy and planning documents relevant to public health and/or PHHR. Government and public health organization (for example, public health associations) websites in both provinces were accessed for documents and key informants and public health experts on our team identified additional relevant documents within their respective provinces. The types of documents included: provincial annual reports, core public health function/standards documents, commission reports on SARS, health human resources (HHR) and PHHR specific reports, health profession legislation, and other public health (PH) reports such as competencies development and leadership frameworks. Documents published between 2003 (beginning at the time of the SARS event) and March, 2011 were included in the analysis. Publicly available and internal provincial government and public health-related policy documents were obtained for BC (n = 27) and ON (n = 20). A small number of government documents were not publicly available but were identified as relevant to the analysis by our government team members. Relevant text from these documents was excerpted to include in the analysis while ensuring the confidentiality of documents was not compromised. While we made every

Ontario agency for health protection and promotion (later renamed Public Health Ontario). [21] to compare key aspects of PHHR policy, planning and management including policy assumptions, collaborations, scope of practice, competencies/education, and planning approaches. NVivo 9, a qualitative software program [22] , was used to organize and analyse the data. Members of the research team independently coded text within the policy documents using the coding template. After all the documents were coded and reviewed by two researchers, reports were obtained for each code, reports were reviewed by the entire the team, and consensus achieved on the coded text. A comparative analysis of BC and ON coded text was then conducted to identify similarities and differences. Narrative descriptions were written for the most frequently coded text and reviewed by the team.

We present the results and discuss the findings according to the most frequently coded HHR sub-categories across the policy documents, identifying and describing differences and similarities between provinces. Table 2 summarizes the top coded categories along with the percentage of documents coded to that category. For example, 90% of the ON documents and 59% of BC documents contained text relevant to the code HHR Planning Activity -education/training/competencies/scope of practice.

Policy documents in both provinces discussed the importance of having an educated, competent public health workforce with the appropriate competencies (knowledge, skills and attitude) for the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. To achieve this, provinces identified the importance of understanding essential public health functions in order to align the competencies necessary to carry out public health functions with appropriate health human resources. These functions were determined through extensive consultation processes in both provinces [23, 24] and nationally [25] . There are distinct differences in how BC defines essential public health functions compared to ON and Canada; but for all three, essential functions of public health include monitoring and assessment of population health status, public health surveillance, health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and health protection and enforcement [15, 25, 26] . The BC Core Public Health Functions Framework [15] , includes two different categories of essential functions:

1. those that are unique and are specifically geared towards public health (the essence of what public health does); and 2. those that help the health system to carry out its core programmes or services. This set of functions is common to the entire health system.

Both of these are considered essential for the provision of public health programmes and services.

Within the context of the BC Core Public Health Functions framework, the essential public health functions (entitled strategies), the 20 core programmes, and the application of equity and population lenses are specific public health functions which are supported by system capacity [15] . The Ontario Public Health Standards set out the minimum requirements for public health programmes and services delivered by the 36 boards of health [16] . The Ontario Public Health Standards consist of four principles (need, impact, capacity, and partnership/collaboration), one foundational standard with specific areas (population health assessment, surveillance, research and knowledge exchange, and programme evaluation), and 14 programme standards grouped into five programme areas. The standards also set out requirements, including public health functions (assessment and surveillance, health promotion and policy development, disease prevention, and health protection) that all boards of health must implement [16] . Provincial government and public health organizations' policy documents dated in the early period of this analysis identify the beginning of efforts to develop public health competencies [15, 27] and in later documents, both provinces build on the national work identifying core competency areas: public health sciences; assessment and analysis; policy and programme planning, implementation and evaluation; partnerships, collaboration and advocacy; diversity and inclusiveness; communication; and leadership [28, 29] . Both provinces undertook intensive processes to identify and explicate core public health competencies that are foundational to support public health renewal including development of core functions and public health standards.

Public health associations in both provinces played an important role in identifying core public health competencies. In ON, the Ontario Public Health Association initially established a Core Competencies Task Group in 2003 with the intent of developing a set of core competencies for public health. To avoid duplication of efforts, the Ontario Public Health Association eventually partnered in the national process to develop core public health competencies [30] . In BC, a multi-phase project was undertaken by the BC Ministry of Health and the Public Health Association of BC, funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The purpose was to identify and address the core and technical competencies most critical to implementing the Core Public Health Functions Framework [15] and to identify competency gaps [28] . Specific objectives of the project were to: Implement processes to meet the competency profile gaps identified in the needs assessment; Recommend appropriate education response (s); Identify the education/training opportunities that facilitate the development of competencies throughout the BC public health sector; and Develop tools for education and workforce planning [28] (p.2).

The importance of strengthening partnerships between academe and public health as an important means of ensuring that the public health workforce is adequately trained was identified in documents in both provinces [27, 31] . Partnerships with universities were also noted as being vital to create programmes that are more aligned with PHHR needs and the inclusion of the education sector in PHHR planning overall. Practiced-based public health experience was highlighted as a key component of education/training programmes to prepare the public health workforce. Both BC and ON documents discussed several strategies to build education capacity in PH including the need to train new PH professionals, integrating core public health competencies in discipline-specific undergraduate education programmes, increasing the profile of PH careers and enrolment in PH programmes, increasing funding for PH education (subsidies, scholarships, and so on), expanding educational modalities (online, summer institutes), and increasing paid student internships and training placements in public health contexts [23, 27, 32] . In the last decade, both provinces have seen an increase in development of public health education programmes including Master's of public health (MPH). In addition, voluntary guidelines for Canadian universities offering MPH programmes were developed in 2006 and revised in 2009 [33] . Investments have been made by the ON government to enhance training and education opportunities for physicians to specialize in community medicine and public health [34] .

Building and sustaining PHHR capacity is also dependent on continuing educational opportunities and the recruitment of new professionals into the system. Public health needs to ensure a competent and diverse public health workforce by providing ongoing staff development and skill building related to core public health competencies, including quality improvement and life-long learning programmes for staff members. Both provinces identified a number of training and education needs for the workforce that include developing knowledge and skills related to: leadership capacity, applying a population and equity lens, diversity and cultural competency, the social determinants of health, interprofessional collaboration, and use of evidence in practice. In BC, specific issues related to Aboriginal health and HHR planning were highlighted [35, 36] while in ON, infection control training was identified [37, 38] . These specific areas reflect contextual factors specific to each province. Consistent with arguments made by Fraser and Greenhalgh [39] , the complexity of public health requires that the workforce must be capable of adapting and responding to the changing context in which they work. This capability is supported by not only identifying the competencies required to provide public health services but by moving beyond these to facilitate different ways for those in the workforce to continue to learn and build on existing competence.

Capacity speaks to the ability of the public health system to respond to the needs of the population. Both provinces recognized the need to increase public health capacity, both in terms of system supports/changes and resources, capability development, and leadership. They also identified the need for appropriate and sufficient staff complements at the local level to meet population health needs. The importance of system capacity to direct public health strategies and support the implementation of programmes and services at local, regional, and provincial levels was identified in the BC Core Public Health Functions [40] and the Ontario Public Health Standards [16] . Specific to BC, system capacity included health information systems, health human resources, staff training and development, research and evaluation, quality management, programme planning and management capabilities, and core competencies [15] . A number of supports for capacity building were identified including those related to PHHR:

Supportive attitudes, values and philosophy that foster a safe, flexible learning environment Supportive attitudes and structures that promote cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity across all aspects of the organization Supportive policies, processes and structures to optimize the application of the core competencies to achieve desired health outcomes. Supporting advocacy to influence systemic change. Provision of resources that support the appropriate application and mix of competencies within the organization Opportunities for training, continuing education and mentoring to acquire and enhance competencies/ support the effective application of competencies Facilitating sustainable collaborative relationships with multiple sectors and partners. [40] (p.8).

While in ON, boards of health are guided by four principles in the standards that explicitly speak to public health capacity and meeting local communities' needs. The four foundational principles are: 1) Need (addressing population health needs effectively and efficiently), 2) Impact (reducing health inequities), 3) Capacity (understanding local capacity and resources, including human resources, required to achieve outcomes), and, 4) Partnership and Collaboration (fostering partnerships to promote community capacities, that is the system includes partners such as other agencies and non-governmental organizations). As with BC, the ON Public Health Standards identify a number of supports for public health capacity building including 'organizational structures and processes; workforce planning, development, and maintenance; information and knowledge systems; and financial resources' [16] (p.13).

In addition to recognizing the need for sufficient and appropriate PH staffing, many Ontario documents focused on surge capacity and emergency response to anticipated and unanticipated events [38, 41] . In their analysis of the SARS event, the Ontario SARS Commission identified the lack of surge capacity as a significant issue in the ability to respond to SARS effectively [41] and the potential to respond to future pandemic events. The different focuses between BC and ON may be explained by the ability of each province to respond to and contain the spread of SARS. Because BC was able to contain the spread of SARS before it reached epidemic proportions, it is likely that the ON public health sector viewed surge capacity as more relevant and a priority than BC did.

Documents in both provinces identified that PHHR requirements to ensure sufficient capacity included an appropriate mix of core competencies, administrative support, and mechanisms such as leadership, partnership with affiliate organizations, and training and recruitment [32, 41, 42] . Some systemic solutions identified in these documents included:

Sustainable employment strategies to increase the supply of HHR Develop increased education and training opportunities for public health professionals Consolidation of smaller health units (specific to the ON context only) Identify and implement models for effective utilization of health human resources during an emergency Systems for identification, coordination, and deployment of emergency HR resources System of cross-training and re-assignment and System of expert field support to ensure all PH practitioners have access to the expertise they need when they need it, including more effective alignment of expertise, training, and support [35, 36] .

Closely aligned with capacity was the discussion of the supply and characteristics of PHHR. Historically HHR planning has focused primarily on staffing numbers; however, many of the PHHR policy documents have approached the issue of 'supply' of PHHR with a broader understanding of planning. This encompasses not only the numbers of staff, but their characteristics such as age of the workforce, and education and competencies, and incorporating issues such as the requirements to meet population health needs into planning. Policy documents published after the SARS event in ON discuss issues of 'shortages' of public health professionals [23, 27] . Given the effects of the SARS event, other public health crises in recent years, and emerging shortages of health professionals in general, it is not surprising that early policy documents were focused on these concerns. For example, early documents discussed the shortage of key public health personnel, in particular, the need for Medical Officers of Health and those health professionals with expertise in infectious diseases [23, 27, 41] . In contrast with ON, BC documents were less focused on the discussion of shortages and improving PHHR supply with the exception of one specific recommendation of enhancing Aboriginal PH staff [35] . At the time of the policy analysis, BC had undertaken planning for a project to enumerate the public health workforce in order to 'to characterize, in a consistent manner, the size, composition and distribution of the formal public health system workforce among multiple health authorities and at the provincial level' [43] (p.1).

In ON, PHHR supply was oriented more generally at systemic issues of resource availability and public health infrastructure. There was an explicit recognition that a dedicated, diverse workforce was required for optimal public health functioning; however, the documents also identified concerns about work environments and their impact on staff [27] . This is consistent with a number of studies and reports that identify the importance of quality work environments on staff recruitment and retention [44, 45] .

Several documents in both BC and ON offered solutions to PHHR shortages, including improving PHHR planning, increased attention to recruitment and retention strategies, increased attention to enrolment and training opportunities, and targeting strategies to address shortages of specific roles in public health [27, [46] [47] [48] . In general, policy documents were more focused on the need for appropriately educated PHHR rather than simply the numbers.

Documents from both provinces recognize that collaboration is necessary across levels of government, within governments, between public health and primary care sectors, as well as with those beyond the health sector such as schools, communities, and other organizations. Integration of public health programmes and policies were deemed necessary to address the interrelatedness of social, physical, and mental health concerns [16, 28] .

BC documents explicitly discussed the importance of intersectoral, multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary collaboration and integration in core programme papers as a strategy to ensure consistent, seamless services and achieve core functions [49] [50] [51] . In addition, the importance of collaboration between public health and primary health care was emphasized as it relates to the delivery of chronic disease prevention programmes and services [49] . BC's focus on intersectoral and multi-sectoral collaboration, as well as collaboration between public health and primary care may relate to the fact that public health is integrated into the larger health care system whereas in ON, public health is separate from the health care system at large. Public health units are not part of the Local Health Integration Networks (regional health authorities) in ON. Public health in the BC core public health documents is viewed as being provided not just by traditional public health workers, but by other professionals working across all areas of the health care system as well as outside the health care system.

ON documents discussed the need to develop and optimize strategic relationships and collaboration with current initiatives, structures, and professional organizations, and actively engage with partners in government, local public health, health care, non-profit, industry, and academia [38, 41] . Clearly defining roles and responsibilities, particularly as they relate to government and public health units, was identified as a strategy to address issues that arise in the case of infectious disease outbreaks, where the potential for conflict and procedural/ administrative holdups might be avoided with more explicit assignment of roles between sectors/jurisdictions [27] . While earlier documents discussed these policy issues and made recommendations for action, more recent documents suggest some policies related to intersectoral collaboration have been developed and implemented. For example, to address the greater coordination and consistency between sectors necessary for infection control, Regional Infection Control Networks have been established in ON [37] .

A noted issue in public health post-SARS was the leadership deficit. Both provinces have identified the development of leadership competencies, enhanced leadership skills training, and building leadership capacity as strategic policy directions [24, 27] . Leadership competencies were understood to be essential to the application of other core public health competencies and to public health worker retention, morale, and productivity [52] . For both provinces, documents outlined the roles and responsibilities of health authorities, the organizational structures of public health bodies, and relationships among public health leadership such as Medical Health Officers [13, 27, 31] .

ON documentation more explicitly addressed a perceived lack of resources for leadership in public health, and identified the need for the province to develop resources such that health unit workers are supported in developing leadership skills [27, 38] . The ON documents also spoke to the barriers, such as time, opportunities, and recognition, to developing strong leaders and leadership skills [23, 29, 38] . Documents indicated the need for leadership training (and valuation thereof ) and professional networks. One document pointed to the importance of employing and retaining professional practice leaders (for example, nurses) in each health unit, and of identifying and cultivating good leaders [27] . Since this time, ON has implemented a new provincial initiative requiring boards of health designate a Chief Nursing Officer in each public health unit [53] .

In terms of PH planning context, both provinces identified the failures of the public health system in the face of SARS, recommending the need to improve the PH system, including local and provincial preparedness, core competencies, and development and skill-building related to public health competencies to support public health professionals to address current and evolving health issues. Documents in both provinces also highlight the unique context of PH planning [27, 43] . While governments had developed HHR policy documents, mostly in response to general shortages of nurses and physicians [20, 45] , many provincial HHR strategies lack a PH component despite the stated desire to strengthen the PH workforce, ensure equity, avoid resource duplication, and enhance coordination and capacity building. A key strategy identified in the documents was the importance of PH collaborating with governments and other partners beyond the immediate health system to address systemic and workforce issues [27, 31] . A responsive public health system requires coordinated planning between systems and HHR. Strategic public health policy development and implementation needs to consider the systemic as well as PHHR issues to achieve policy goals [11] .

Populations of concern/ priority populations BC and ON documents prioritized the importance of the social and environmental determinants of health in reducing health inequities [15, 16, 52] . Documents in both provinces emphasized the importance of considering inequity and population health perspectives in moving public health priorities forward [16, 54] . Both provinces also spoke of targeting programming to meeting local need and of developing programmes to address characteristics (for example, food, early childhood development) in specific contexts and settings (for example, schools, gardens, and so on). Both the BC Core Public Health Functions and Ontario Public Health Standards discuss the importance of public health addressing the specific needs of those populations considered vulnerable or at-risk; BC refers to populations of concern or vulnerable populations while ON uses the term priority populations. In a separate analysis, researchers examined BC and ON public health renewal documents for how they conceptualized health equity. They identified that while both provinces defined health inequities in a similar way, how health equity was discussed in policy documents differed [55] .

In BC, health authorities (which include public health) may conduct a gap analysis often based on population health status assessments; these assessments can aid in identification of populations of concern and health issues that need to be addressed through public health programmes and services [56] . In addition, the use of both a population health and equity lens are explicitly described as fundamental to the core functions and contribute to identification of populations of concern. One example of a priority population for public health programmes and services in BC is First Nations/Aboriginal peoples reflecting that province's context [15, 57] including development of a First Nations health plan of which HHR is a critical component [35] . Most BC documents explicitly identified First Nations/ Aboriginal peoples, and strongly emphasized the importance of developing culturally-appropriate programmes in partnership with Aboriginal communities and other diverse groups such as immigrants and refugees [31] . BC documents recognized that tailored programmes specifically supporting Aboriginal health and health determinants are essential, and that these programmes will need to be flexible to accommodate the diversity of contexts, communities, and governance structures that exist. In terms of HHR, BC also explicitly recognized that Aboriginal health supports are often overlooked in the public health sphere because they tend to fall outside of provincial health care jurisdiction.

The ON documents defined priority populations broadly, as those populations identified by surveillance, epidemiological or other research studies, that are at risk and for which public health interventions may be reasonably considered to have a substantial impact at the population level [16] . In this approach to identifying priority populations, a population health lens is explicitly discussed while the application of an equity lens is assumed in the use of terms such as 'health inequities'. However, no documents specify the use of an equity lens to identify priority populations. In ON, low-income individuals and Aboriginal populations were also identified as examples of priority populations; however, the focus on Aboriginal populations is less obvious in ON documents. In ON, each public health unit is responsible for identifying priority populations specific to their context and jurisdiction [16] . For both BC and ON, the specific local level priorities would not necessarily be captured in provincial policy documents.

Public health renewal in BC and ON has highlighted significant issues in the public health workforce. Policy documents from government and related public health organizations in both provinces have identified similar key issues in planning the public health workforce. These include the importance of education, training, and competencies required to meet BC Core Public Health Functions/ON Public Health Standards, ensuring a sufficient supply of needed PHHR, developing public health leadership, ensuring public health capacity exists to address significant events, addressing the unique needs of priority populations/populations of concern, and the importance of intersectoral collaboration. HHR planning in general has shifted away from a narrow focus on supply or numbers of healthcare providers to focus more on identification of population health needs and addressing health inequities, and the competencies required to meet these needs [20] . This shift is evident in many of the public health policy documents reviewed with much of the discussion focused on core public health competencies, education and training, and professional development as important elements to support the public health workforce. The delivery of effective and efficient public health programme and services requires consideration of both the competence and capabilities of the workforce [39] . These provincial policy documents also align with national strategic directions emphasizing core competencies unique to public health [10, 58] . Similarities in BC and ON PHHR policy directions provide common ground for collaborative work, building on the national PHHR policy vision [10] . This collaboration may reduce duplication and more efficiently use financial and human resources.

Researchers and policy-makers have called for HHR planning approaches that are based on population health needs rather than utilization trends [10, 20] . Both provinces have identified the importance of planning public health services based on identifying regional/local population health needs and have incorporated these into their provincial policies [16, 59] ; this may provide needed information to support planning of PHHR based on assessed population health needs within regional health authorities or local health boards. Planned analysis in this programme of research includes a review of public health workforce plans.

While many similarities exist between the provinces, the context distinctive to each province has influenced and shaped how they have focused their PHHR policies. Clearly, the SARS event had a considerable impact on PHHR policy discussions in ON, particularly in the mid-2000s with recommendations for PHHR strongly linked to SARS-related issues such as surge capacity, lack of collaboration between sectors, and shortages of some public health personnel such as Medical Officers of Health and infection control specialists. For BC, the early focus on essential public health functions influenced PHHR policy and placed greater emphasis on the competencies required to meet core functions. Furthermore, given the differences between the provinces in how public health is delivered, PHHR policy must be context specific [11] . BC and ON differ in how PH is situated in the broader health care system, whether integrated into health authorities in BC or more independent and autonomous in ON, this has implications for PHHR planning. The unique contexts in BC and ON were evident in the findings; aspects of PHHR were emphasized differently in policy development and implementation.

This policy analysis identified progressive work on PHHR policy and planning with early documents providing an inventory of PHHR issues to be addressed and later documents providing evidence of beginning policy development and implementation. In recent months, ON published their provincial strategic plan for PH [60] and BC has published its updated guiding framework for PH [59] . Both provinces' documents highlight the importance of PHHR to achieve strategic directions in PH. However, while much policy-related work has been conducted to enhance PHHR planning in both provinces, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of the PHHR strategies. Looking ahead, future analyses should examine implementation of provincial PHHR policies at the local or regional level to examine the extent to which strategic directions are achieved. A key focus of the RePHS study is to examine the impact of provincial policies on the public health workforce at the public health unit or regional level in both provinces further enhancing understanding of PHHR policy and planning.

BMC Public Health Establishing a nationwide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in Taiwan,"Background: With international concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and bioterrorist attacks, public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems. A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making.","groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities.

Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.

With the recent global concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and the challenges of the 2003 SARS epidemics, government health officials in SARS-affected countries have begun to consider various measures of improving their infectious disease surveillance systems [1] [2] [3] [4] . Infectious disease epidemiologists and several leading public health administrators at the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) becoming aware of the importance of early detection of EID or bioterrorism, started developing an automatic alert system. Therefore, the Automatic Syndromic Surveillance Planning Task Force Committee was created and recruited infection physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and information technology (IT) experts in July 2003 to oversee the initiation and development of Taiwan's first medical informatics-based emergency department syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS).

To prepare for this project, we reviewed the syndromic surveillance systems of other countries and officials of health informatics at Taiwan-CDC started collaborating with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to develop a real-time syndromic surveillance system for Taiwan in August 2003 [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . RODS, used during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, is the first commonly used syndromic surveillance system in the United States and has been found to efficiently process and analyze data in a timely manner [9] [10] [11] . Together, the task force and the RODS group aimed to establish a nationwide syndromic surveillance system within six months to meet the challenges of potential avian flu outbreaks for up-coming winter seasons and other future EIDs. To gain more operational level experiences, we also visited the Department of Health in New York City, where syndromic surveillance system was established and has been in daily operation since 2001 [12] . There, the task force members observed routine workflow processes and became familiar with other practical concerns of operating an ED-SSS on a daily basis. Based on these experiences and high population density in Taiwan, we decided to create a nationwide surveillance system. To this nationwide ED-SSS, we added geographical information system (GIS) technology, meant to facilitate epidemiological investigation and feedback between data providers and decision-makers [13] .

Using the electronic data from the health information systems already in place in about eighty percent of the hospitals in Taiwan required by the National Health Insurance Payment Program and the technical support of the RODS Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, Taiwan's ED-SSS has been in operation since March, 2004 [14] . It is the first time in Taiwan that information technology and timely data directly from hospitals has been used with systematic approaches to facilitate public health surveillance. This report shares our experience of establishing an ED-SSS in a non-English-speaking country. It covers the process of taking into account the various needs at different levels of hospitals, discusses the stages of developing the system, and highlights the characteristics of ED-SSS data collected during the first year. The experiences reported here may benefit other countries seeking to establish or improve their own surveillance systems for infectious disease.

Initially, two Taipei City Municipal Hospitals that kept electronic files of their emergency department patients' medical information were selected as pilot sites. From these two pilot hospitals, we had learned work flow involved in the process of data transfer, format of Chinese chief complaints, practical concern of ED (such as heavy workload etc.) during and after the 2003 outbreak of SARS, and available electronic ED information from nationwide emergency care hospitals. To obtain more representative data from various geographical areas, we gradually enlisted the cooperation of 189 hospitals nationwide, all offering emergency healthcare. Because many outbreaks of EIDs require emergency health care, these emergency care-designated hospitals were required transmit their ED triage and patient data to the Taiwan-CDC electronically on a daily basis ( Figure 1 ).

Nurses at the triage stations at all participating hospitals generated the bulk of the information needed for syndromic surveillance. That information included time and date of admission, date of birth, gender, home zip-code, body temperature, triage categories and chief complaints for patients admitted to their EDs. Because the National Health Insurance requires hospitals to keep clinical data written in ICD-9 codes based on the criteria of the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) for billing purposes, we were also able to collect clinical data from initial assessment of each case by an ED physician. These fundamental data were provided in either the health level-seven protocol (HL-7) format or extensible Markup Language (XML) format, if HL-7 was not used by a hospital during the time of the study. Thus, ED-SSS is capable of accepting these data of above-mentioned variables (Table 1) , including the patients' clinical and demographical information, and hospital identification numbers, in either format.

All the sentinel hospitals recruited into our system had independent MySQL servers on which their data were saved, plus a remote connecting program for automatic transfer of data. Data files generated by the 189 hospitals, including data from their triage classification systems, hospital information systems (HIS) and clinical information systems (CIS), were firstly de-identified and then transferred hourly to a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 at the Taiwan-CDC. Hyper text transfer protocol over secured sockets layer (HTTPS) or secured file transfer protocol (SFTP) was used in this process. All communication histories were recorded in a log file in the SQL server at the Taiwan-CDC and monitored daily by health informatics personnel. A program was written into the system so that each transfer attempt to the Taiwan-CDC would automatically generate an e-mail to the hospital notifying them whether the transfer had been successful or not.

Three different data storage tables were designed to process the data in the Taiwan-CDC's syndromic surveillance database. All information received is initially fed into the first table, with a serial number generated in an additional column for each case. The system picks up the data from the first table every five minutes and moves it into a second temporary table for a logic check and data cleansing. At this point, the system checks for unambiguously erroneous data, e.g., a birth date later than the admission date or other variables such as body temperatures that fall outside of reasonable ranges. The data cleansing work is accomplished through a system algorithm written with SQL commands. The cleaned-up data are transferred to the third table for further epidemiological analysis, aberration detection, and then sent them to related local public health agencies.

Although only a few variables were collected from each hospital on consecutive days, one major difficulty we had was the data presented by discontinuous data, i.e. data that sometimes be there and sometimes not. Sometimes data were repeated. To handle this problem, specific criteria of data cleansing were used for different variables, including the logic checks described above and double checks for possible presence of duplicate patient records. If data in the chief complaint field was written as ""test"" or the field was left empty or if the ICD-9 field was written as ""test"" or left empty, they were deleted before data analysis. Hospital ID, date of birth, admission time, gender, and home zip-code were used as key indicators of whether a listing is a duplicate listing and be deleted as repeated data. The system was capable of performing frequent and rapid checks of any subject of hospital identification code and time format of all time fields. It was capable of moving erroneous data to an ""error table"" for storage. Incorrectly formatted ICD-9-CM data were also moved to the error table. All deletion and removal operations were recorded in the log file for monitoring. In certain situa-tions in case possible systematic errors were found (i.e., aberrant number of ED visits on certain days or occasionally inconsistent formats of ICD-9 codes), the data examiner would contact the medical informatics officers of those specific hospitals to discuss improving data entry.

After the data cleansing, we categorized ED visits into 11 different syndromic groups important in Taiwan. There were: (1) fever, (2) respiratory, (3) skin, (4) neurological, (5) upper gastrointestinal (GI), (6) lower GI, (7) haemorrhagic, (8) influenza-like illness (ILI), (9) asthma, (10) enterovirus-related infection (EVI) syndrome, and (11) syndrome for severe illness or death. Since only about 25% of all chief complaints were written fully in English and the grouping of syndromes by chief-complaints due to Chinese language barriers would have effects on the outbreak detection ability, we first analyzed our data according to the ICD-9 coded syndrome groups [15] . Definitions of clinical syndromes were based on two different sources: (1) those associated with bioterrorism-related agents as announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S.; and (2) those identified as important by the ED-SSS Advisory Committee in Taiwan, whose members include infectious disease physicians, emergency doctors, pediatricians, and epidemiologists [16] . For example, because the epidemics of enterovirus 71 caused severe fatal cases in Taiwan in the years of 1998, 2000 and 2001, the EVI syndrome group was considered as an important syndrome group locally (ICD-9 codes listed in Table 2 ) [17] . All patient information was de-identified and only aggregated data was used for data analysis. The protocol for this study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board) of National Taiwan University. 20 Coxsackie carditis, unspecified 074. 21 Coxsackie pericarditis 074. 22 Coxsackie endocarditis 074. 23 Coxsackie myocarditis, Aseptic myocarditis of newborn 074. 3 Hand, foot, and mouth disease Vesicular stomatitis and exanthem 074. 8 Other specified diseases due to Coxsackie virus, Acute lymphonodular pharyngitis Although the ED-SSS data started transferring on March 10, 2004, we confined our analysis to data collected between April 1, 2004 (when the data became more stabilized) and March 31, 2005 . Data were organized using statistical programs to perform a descriptive analysis of the daily and weekly plots of different syndrome cases and obtain a baseline pattern for each syndrome in Taiwan. We initially generated the SQL commands for data querying and data grouping into the 11 different syndromic groups. To increase the sensitivity of this ED-SSS in monitoring regional patterns of these 11 syndrome groups, we categorized ED-SSS data by four different geographical areas (northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan), based on major regional variations in the types of infec-tious diseases. In analyzing the seasonal patterns of ED visits, the correlation between the ILI syndrome and respiratory or asthma syndrome was assessed by the value of Pearson's coefficient (R). the Taiwan-CDC on a daily basis. The greatest challenge as began to develop this system was communication with different hospitals. Because different hospitals were using different information systems and inputting different data with various formats, it took long time to agree which variables and their data format should be collected. At the very beginning to build the ED-SSS, we had at first intended to collect information on a large set of epidemiologically useful variables, including occupation, travel history, family clustering, other exposure-related factors, and address for each patient to help detect possible zoonosis. However, such data were not collected during routine medical examination and care. Finally, we decided to capture only parameters usually collected by the hospitals during examination, intake and care.

During the planning phase, it was necessary to gain a full understanding of what not only just public health personnel expected but also what the medical staff at participating hospitals expected from the ED-SSS. Public health officials tended to prefer a timely and sensitive surveillance system able to detect all possible outbreaks of emerging or known infectious diseases. Mostly concerned over the limited public health resources, they wanted more evidence to prove the cost-effectiveness of ED-SSS and fewer false positive signals from pilot studies before integrating the system into routine public health surveillance workflow. On the other hand, the hospitals and their medical staff had three major expectations. First, the hospitals expected an easily operated feedback mechanism and quick feedback of useful information for better decision-making. Those who had experienced nosocomial infection of SARS during the 2003 SARS outbreak were particularly interested having analyzed information, based on their own hospital or regional/national hospital data, quickly fed back them. They believed that this would provide incentive for them to share hospital data and routinely maintain the high quality of their data for public health usage. Second, the hospitals anticipated two-way communication with public health agencies, as they frequently been requested or even forced to send data on short notice when they were too busy or too involved in emergency care. What made matters worse, despite their compliance; they had difficulty in obtaining useful feedback information from the public health agencies so that they could improve their care of patients at the time of an outbreak crisis. Third, the hospital decision-makers wanted immediate firsthand feedback, particularly with regard to control of nosocomial infection and hospital management in order that their health-care workers could be protected during regional outbreaks. Considering the expectations of both public health agencies and hospitals, we learned that the syndromic surveillance system should provide efficient means of feedback and effective two-way communication.

From April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2005 , data transmitted from the 189 hospitals on 2,692,325 ED visits were collected and stored in the Taiwan-CDC database. Initially, we appointed two computer engineers to cleanse the data by checking the log files and inform the hospitals by telephone on weekdays to correct errors or provide missing data. Then, these cleaned data on daily counts of ED visits collected from ED-SSS were analyzed. The time series plot of rough data on daily numbers of ED visits in our nationwide ED-SSS during the study period is shown in Figure 3 .

The computer system shut down twice during this period. The first time occurred from August 8 th to August 9 th , when no daily procedure was installed to monitor the quality of uploaded data. To help both hospitals and public health agencies perform routine data quality checks, we installed a computer program having check-up procedures of data quality after each data transfer from the hospital to the Taiwan-CDC for automatic quality control of data. This program records all the logs of each data sending from the participated hospitals. If Taiwan-CDC doesn't receive data from hospitals, program will send e-mail automatically to inform the personnel of health informatics in that hospital about failure sending. System maintenance personnel need to check the log daily and make a phone call to the hospital to verify successful data transfer and quality of data if there are no data transfers in two consecutive days.

Only 5.04% of hospitals failed to send ICD-9-CM data, but almost half (47.4%) failed to send chief complaints. For example, of the 239,617 sets of cleaned data received in July 2005, about 7.1% of ICD-9-CM information was lacking or filled out as 'null' and 54.82% of cases did not include chief complaints. Additionally, certain hospitals transmitted the patients' chief complaints in Chinese, further complicating the analysis. Because of these difficulties, this report focuses on the data based on ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes only. The time-series plots of the 11 syndrome groups (Figure 4 , 5) that may correlate to infectious diseases and important health problems in Taiwan (e.g., asthma has become an important pediatric problem in recent years) were analyzed.

Understanding the characteristics and patterns of numbers of ED visits over time from our established ED-SSS in Taiwan is very crucial before we set up appropriate threshold levels of different syndrome groups for outbreak detection, There was a significant difference in daily counts between weekdays and weekends, which occurred on a weekly basis. ED visits were 1.288-fold-higher on weekends than on weekdays (p < 0.001), while national During this first year study, the ED-SSS found patients throughout Taiwan were more likely to seek emergency medical services at medical centers than at district or local hospitals. Most patients visiting ED were 60 years old or older (21.46%) or below the age of 10 years old (18.55%). These two groups were also at greatest risk for various infectious diseases, especially influenza (Table 3) . Young adults between 20 to 39 years old ranked the third most frequent visitors to ED (17.43%), though traffic accidents, not infectious diseases, were the main reasons for their visits. These age distributions suggest that the newly established ED-SSS was capable of providing information for the age groups most at risk for severe cases of infectious diseases in Taiwan. Male ED patients slightly outnumbered female ED patients (male : female = 1.12:1), which approximates the general distribution of gender in Taiwan (male/female ratio = 1.10). For elderly ED patients (age > 65 years old), the male/female ratio in our sample was the same as general population (male: female = 1.10:1).

To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the eleven important syndrome groups and asthma syndrome in ED-SSS, data of their daily and weekly counts were plotted and shown in Figure 4 and 5, respectively. As can been seen in time series plots in Figure 6 , the seasonal patterns for ED visits due to respiratory syndrome and ILI syndrome were quite similar with high correlation (R = 0.98), while that for asthma syndrome, which had distinct peaks, was nonetheless not highly correlated with ILI syndrome (R = 0.78) nor respiratory syndrome (R = 0.77). Importantly, the ED-SSS was able to detect peaks of these respiratory-related syndromes even occurred in or around the summer season (July to September), though their most noticeable peaks were found during the Chinese new year holidays ( Figure 5B, 5C, 5D ). Like respiratory infection syndrome, visits due to the fever syndrome also showed another peak during the summer (July to September) ( Figure 4A ). ED visits for respiratory syndrome peaked earlier (mid-September) than those visits for ILI (mid-October) and asthma syndrome (end of September, e.g. the transition period between summer and autumn). Visits for pediatric asthma syndrome for children 12 years old and below peaked in mid-autumn, around mid-October (data not shown). Later during winter season (between November and February), there was an increase 

Respiratory Syndrom Asthma Visits In gastrointestinal (GI) syndromes, visits due to upper GI or lower GI or total GI started increasing November 2004 and peaked during the Chinese New Year holidays ( Figure  4F, 4G, 4H) . Interestingly, cases of hemorrhagic syndrome also increased slightly in the winter season ( Figure 4I ).

For those syndrome groups with severe symptoms, including skin rash, neurological symptoms and death/ coma that might be related to bioterrorism attacks, there was no significantly cyclic or seasonal patterns ( Figure 4J , 4K and 4L). One spike of syndrome cases with clinical severity (severe syndrome) appeared in mid-May, but that occurred as a result of one hospital sending duplicate data that escaped from our check algorithm ( Figure 4L ).

Taiwan has very high population density (Taiwan, 632.23 persons/km 2 ; Taipei, 9662.53 persons/km 2 ), which increases the spread of many human-to-human infectious diseases [19] . This makes the surveillance of infectious diseases very important for this island. Taiwan's ED-SSS is the first syndromic surveillance system to be implemented in Asia. It also represents the first time that Taiwan's public health agencies have attempted active nationwide surveillance. Its automatic data collection mechanism is capable of capturing comprehensive population-based health information and providing important details on current disease epidemics at the community level. The information it provides can also be used as community baseline data for further infectious disease modeling and can also improve the detection of emerging infectious diseases.

In addition to the information that the ED-SSS can provide for disease control, it can open avenues for further investigation. For example, in addition to the neurological syndrome, asthma syndrome, and syndrome for severe symptoms, there were clear and consistent weekend and holiday increases in the visits of other nine syndrome groups. Because cost of ED visits in Taiwan is not as expensive as it is in other countries, especially the United States, it is very likely that many patients seek ED medical care when local clinics are closed on weekends and holidays. It is also possible that the gathering of people on the holidays would increase the transmission of certain pathogens, particularly on cold days in closed spaces where respiratory viruses including influenza virus are easily transmitted. Therefore, future research might want to investigate the effect of holidays on the aberration detection of outbreaks and prediction of number of cases for certain infectious diseases using Taiwan's ED-SSS.

We also found differences in seasonal trends in visits due to symptoms/signs related to respiratory, influenza-like illness and asthma syndromes. Our ED-SSS found a sum-mer peak in visits for cases with influenza-like illnesses in 2004. This has seldom been found by the previous passive surveillance systems used in Taiwan. These summer cases of influenza-like illness occurred before annual vaccinations usually done in October or November. Therefore, a further longitudinal analysis of influenza-like syndrome patterns is needed to formulate the best vaccination policy on human influenza.

Another epidemiological finding from our ED-SSS was an increasing trend in visits due to gastrointestinal syndrome starting late autumn 2004. Such trends have not been detected by other infectious disease surveillance systems in Taiwan. There are two possible explanations for this finding. One reason for the increases might be related to the increased activity of certain pathogens, including rotavirus or norovirus, during winter season, as was found during the winter of 2006 in both Japan and Taiwan [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Another reason might be the social habits of Taiwanese who like to dip raw meats and seafood into boiling water fondues and eat from the chafing pot during the winter season. This would increase the change that inexperienced or careless diners would consume undercook seafood or use chopsticks contaminated by raw seafood.

The findings of our ED-SSS, the first time in Taiwan to use daily rather than weekly data, suggest further directions for research into GI syndrome and many other diseases of significant interest to public health. For example, during the 1998, 2000 and 2001 enterovirus 71 epidemics, children aged 3 years and younger who were at higher risk of severe or fatal cases of the disease were identified for more effective prevention only after the occurrence of several cases of sudden deaths from weekly sentinel physician surveillance and later retrospective epidemiological data analysis on those cases when sample size became larger. Therefore, prospective monitoring of daily ongoing data of EVI syndrome in this high risk age group and early ED-SSS detection of enterovirus activities by local public health personnel might help minimize social panic among parents. Furthermore, the results on seasonal pattern of enterovirus-like infection in our ED-SSS was consistent with the previous epidemic patterns in Taiwan, again demonstrating the usefulness of ED-SSS to avoid future large-scale or severe epidemics caused by enteroviruses [18] . In summary, these initial findings suggest that it is necessary to develop algorithms capable of detecting aberrations for different syndrome groups from patients in different geographical areas of Taiwan, taking into account variations in the levels of medical care and the effect of weekends and holidays on ER visit.

The ED-SSS did not, however, reveal obvious trends in all syndrome groups. For example, it was hard to find seasonal patterns or secular trends in cases of coma/death, skin rash, or neurological symptoms -the three syndrome groups that might be useful in the detection of severe outbreaks caused by bioterrorism, e.g., anthrax, during the study period without bioterrorism attacks [28, 29] . Certainly, continuous monitoring for these syndrome groups at both local and national levels will be very helpful in detecting possible bioterrorism or EIDs in future years. Using those trends in coma/death and other syndrome groups of clinical severity or unexpected symptoms/signs, our ED-SSS data have provided directions for further research in the areas of pathogen detection, epidemiological clues, and improvement in public health policies. Therefore, future investigations have to control the weekend and holiday effects of ED visits for better aberration detection even during long holidays.

In daily public health practice to monitor the data of ED-SSS, careful verification and systematic management is needed once the aberration signals are detected. The server needs an automatic error feedback system function instead of the original use of engineers to double check for data errors would increase the efficiency and completeness of surveillance. Future efforts require closer collaboration between computer-science professionals and medical informatics personnel at the Taiwan-CDC to establish a system with the standard operating procedures (SOP) for database maintenance and to provide more continuous on-job training for both hospital users and local and central public health agencies [30] .

The major difficulty in developing our ED-SSS was diverse formats for different types of data, including categories of chief complaints, the ways to fill out ICD-9-CM codes, and even the different number of digits used in home zip codes in different participated hospitals. For example, most Taiwan hospital ED physicians/nurses EDs only write down one chief complaint, which is very different from the ED reports made by most U.S. hospitals which list all possible complaints (with text format) in English. Several participating hospitals only had a paper system for recording triage chief complaint data. A standard format for select syndromes and variables needs to be established and continuously reevaluated to improve data quality and stability of data transmission. There are needs to have more research into the chief complaints with Chinese styles, the suitability of chief complaints vs. ICD-9 codes, how to combine symptoms/signs and link data to improve sensitivity.

With regard to the current epidemics of avian influenza H5N1 in China and many other southeast Asian countries, an ED-SSS like the one we developed in Taiwan may play an important role in detecting an outbreak possibly caused by human-to-human transmission even when cluster size is small [31] [32] [33] [34] . Through early detection, ED-SSS may help minimize the adaptation of avian influenza virus to human populations. Because of the large volume of business traffic, international travelers, and workers from Southeast Asia coming to Taiwan, it has previously been difficult to do real-time surveillance for imported infectious diseases, including dengue, malaria, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and SARS. However, using the ED-SSS to monitor health status at the community level may help public health decision-makers handle unexpected health threats. Because countries are so interconnected today, it is imperative that we share our health information and experiences with other countries if international health is to be guarded. Our ED-SSS has equipped Taiwan the ability to closely monitor avian influenza and other potential EIDs in Asia and worldwide. We hope that by sharing our experiences developing ED-SSS, other countries can be encouraged to develop and improve their own surveillance systems for infectious disease.

Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise A Commentary from the International Society for Disease Surveillance Steps to a Sustainable Public Health Surveillance Enterprise OJPHI,"At a time when populations are changing and disease outbreaks and other events of public health significance pose increasing risks to global health, economic stability, and national security, it is essential that, as a nation, we invest in the systems needed to promote and protect the public's health.","Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5 

In 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that the public health system in the United States had a multitude of deficiencies that impact the ability to effectively conduct public health surveillance. These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the public health surveillance enterprise:

1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security. 2. Create and support funding mechanisms that reinforce enterprise (i.e., integrated systems), rather than categorical (i.e., disease or program specific) surveillance infrastructures and activities in order to reduce inefficient silos, leverage resources, and foster synergies. 3. Oppose further cuts to spending for surveillance activities. 4. Invest in surveillance workforce development to build competencies and improve organizational capacity to utilize technological advances in surveillance practice. 5. Advance a rigorous surveillance research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence for decision-making. 

Public health surveillance is defined as, ""the systematic and ongoing collection, management, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information for the purpose of informing the actions of public health decision makers."" 3 In addition to providing information about the health status of our communities, surveillance is a foundation of emergency preparedness, food safety, infectious disease outbreak prevention and control, chronic disease assessments, and other key areas that protect the health, economy, and security of the public. While public health surveillance policy and practice have been indicated as priorities for policymakers at the national and global levels, [4] [5] [6] [7] questions remain about how to move forward from planning to implementation, especially in a time of critical cuts to federal funding.

Progress in health information technology (IT) and the increased use of electronic data and new data streams offer great potential for innovation in surveillance science and practice. For instance, the self-reporting of health information through social media (e.g., Twitter), as well as crowdsourcing projects such as Flu Near You (www.flunearyou.org) offer new options for collecting timely data. In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, 8 legislated as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, is fueling the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S. 9 In return for financial subsidies to implement EHR systems, hospitals and doctors are required to share data for public health purposes 9 with the intent to improve both population health outcomes and the quality of clinical practice. Sustainable surveillance systems have the potential to advance both of these goals. 10

The value of public health surveillance 1. Recognize systematic and ongoing public health surveillance as a core public health function that is essential for population health, economic stability, and national security.

Public health surveillance data is the foundation of public health programs and is required for a number of purposes, including: to demonstrate the size and impact of the public health problem being addressed by a program; to identify the population groups to which additional prevention efforts should be directed; to determine whether the problem is growing in size or abating; to provide feedback to data providers; and as part of an overall program evaluation strategy.

The significant health impacts and economic costs of disease outbreaks illustrate the critical importance of effective public health surveillance and rapid response, as well as the cost of inaction. 11 Table 1 provides examples of the health and financial burdens posed by some naturally occurring and intentional infectious disease outbreaks. The values reported in Table 1 do not fully reflect additional indirect costs of diseases and their potentially crippling effects on a community, nor do they address costs that are underreported/ unreported due to lack of data. Higher rates of illness, for example, can lead to lower worker productivity, 11 while premature mortality can reduce the size of the labor force, both of which have economic ramifications.

There is growing evidence that these economic and societal costs can be mitigated by surveillance systems that are stable; a stable system provides the best foundation for identifying whether the problem being addressed is getting bigger or smaller or disproportionately affecting a section of the population, etc., while still allowing flexibility to provide useful information quickly about emerging issues. The optimum mix of stability and flexibility will depend on the purpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under surveillance. For example, in OJPHI the case of SARS, an effective surveillance system has the potential to decrease the size of an epidemic by one-third and the duration by 4 weeks, with significant cost savings. 25 Another study found that the early detection of an outbreak of highly infectious bacterial meningitis saved approximately $2 for every dollar invested in infectious disease surveillance. 26 Yet another evaluation of surveillance practice found that technological improvements in a sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Virginia saved over $9,500 (1,992 hours) in staff-time during the 2007-2008 influenza seasons. 27 Ongoing surveillance can also inform the design and evaluation of prevention and intervention programs in order to control the escalating costs associated with chronic diseases in the U.S. and abroad. 28 Some experts forecast that chronic disease prevention programs could save up to $48.9 billion per year by 2030, 29 while others predict applying electronic medical record implementation and networking to the prevention and management of chronic disease will exceed the currently projected $81 billion in annual savings. 30

Siloed surveillance systems are outdated, inefficient, and incapable of meeting today's demands for electronic data exchange and for the informatics capabilities needed to use the information for maximum benefit. Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health. 

By contrast, an enterprise approach provides a cohesive framework that will better equip public health practitioners to address the challenges of processing large volumes of electronic data, and the concomitant analytical and visualization requirements. Specifically, enterprise funding supports a reliable, flexible infrastructure that can adapt to technological and information requirement changes, and allows for ongoing data collection and the integration of new data sources to advance all-hazard preparedness. A 2004 White House memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies in system acquisitions and usage and called for applying technological and human resources across programs. 35 By encouraging collaboration within and between departments, surveillance professionals can take advantage of shared platforms and resources to optimize data collection, analysis, storage, and dissemination, thus helping to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. For example, collaboration could create opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable disease data for public health use. 36

A lack of consistent and sustainable funding is hampering the necessary expansion and improvement of public health surveillance systems at local, state, and national public health agencies. A 2010 survey of local health departments conducted by the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO) found that 72% of local health departments reported insufficient funding as one of their major barriers to modernizing their IT systems. 37 Health data collection systems that take advantage of recent technological advances have proven to be more cost effective and sustainable in the long-term. 38 Stable funding is essential to supporting the adoption of hardware and software systems as they become available, leading to a robust and sustainable public health surveillance infrastructure able to integrate, manage, and communicate the plethora of data necessary to generate actionable results. 39

The new age of disease surveillance requires a skilled public health workforce able to manage large volumes of increasingly complex electronic information, to understand the data flows, and to extract meaning from them. This calls for sophisticated and integrated competencies in public health informatics, epidemiology, statistics, and other areas, and the ability to present findings, draw conclusions, and make recommendations based on surveillance data. Furthermore, in addition to needing people who can effectively operate existing surveillance systems and carry out tasks (such as the onboarding process for collecting newly available EHR data) there is also demand for people who can identify and assess new opportunities for surveillance and design new systems that take advantage of these opportunities. 6 Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org * Vol. 5, No. 2, 2013

Attracting and retaining experts in these fields is especially challenging in light of the comparatively low base salaries allotted to public health workers compared to the salaries of technology-intensive positions in other sectors. 40 To align the surveillance workforce with new demands, the ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup suggests the following approaches:

• Provide training programs for existing and prospective public health workers to equip themselves with the necessary expertise and skills to work in rapidly evolving IT systems. • Promote public health careers at the primary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels across disciplines. • Provide competitive salaries to recruit and retain a workforce skilled in public health surveillance and informatics.

5. Advance a rigorous research and evaluation agenda that will deepen the understanding of community health, identify best practices, and provide evidence to inform decision-making.

Research and evaluation play an important role in connecting the processes of information collection, information use for decision-making, and translation of decisions to actions and measurable outcomes. Research-based evidence and evaluation results can help to identify the limitations and benefits of different surveillance procedures for better decision-making and more effective resource allocation. Investing in research and applying the rigors of science to public health surveillance questions leads to informed decisions on how best to direct efforts and resources.

In addition, periodic evaluations of surveillance infrastructuresthe systems and people-are needed to assess return on investment and opportunities for quality improvement.

Effective and efficient surveillance systems are proven to save money and lives. The ability to detect and respond to known and emerging pathogens is central to protecting and maintaining population health. 41 The breakdown or absence of a stable public health surveillance infrastructure, on the other hand, can undermine efforts to mitigate disease outbreaks and other public health events. 31 Public health surveillance systems built on a strong infrastructure of core workforce competencies, information systems, and organizational capacity, 42 and supported by consistent and enterprise-based funding, are essential if we are to understand and respond to the real and growing threats to population health. By providing political commitment and financial support to this issue, decision makers can play an active role in advancing the health of individuals, communities, and nations.

Pandemic planning in pediatric care: A website policy review and national survey data,"Objectives: This study investigates current policies, key issues, and needs for pandemic planning in pediatrics in Canada. Methods: Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants' perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations' and regions' pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results: The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans. Conclusions: Although many plans provide guidelines for medical and policy issues in pediatrics, much more work remains in psychosocial and ethical planning. A focus on children and families is needed for pandemic planning in pediatrics to ensure best outcomes for children and families.","The impact of pandemic H1N1 (2009) has raised public awareness of the threat of a severe influenza outbreak, as the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial, and territorial bodies continue to bolster their contingency plans. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) revealed gaps in Ontario's emergency response capability, and highlighted the need to prepare for future epidemics. The effects of this outbreak resulted in a total of 251 probable cases and 43 deaths in Canada [1] . SARS heavily impacted the health care system in Ontario and in affected areas across the globe. Recent memories of this outbreak, coupled with the threat of pandemic H1N1 (2009) warn of the impacts of a major outbreak in Canada. Accordingly, planning has become a pressing issue for stakeholders in government, industry and community. While the exact timing, pattern and impact of a future pandemic is unknown [2, 3] , in Canada an influenza pandemic could result in as many as 10.6 million people (35%) who become clinically ill, 138,000 (0.5%) who require hospitalization, and up to 58,000 deaths (0.2%) [4] . Such concerns have become a high profile public health issue, and fears of a potential global pandemic continue to grow. Governments, policy makers, and health care providers (HCP), are planning for future pandemics, in part, based upon the lessons learned from SARS. Health Canada [5] has identified gaps in the response to SARS that should influence current policies and planning. For example, there is still a need to address ethical concerns during a pandemic, for instance, governments may be required to infringe upon civil liberties to ensure infection control, and policy makers need to establish frameworks for decisionmaking to allocate scarce health care resources [6] . A lack of coordination and communication, the poor management of resources, and the absence of a clear leadership structure within organizations and government also had a detrimental effect on the effort to control the SARS outbreak [6] [7] [8] .

Outside of Canada, critical gaps have been identified in European Union (EU) plans. These concerns include a lack of cooperation among EU countries and poorly delineated roles and responsibilities of central and regional health authorities. In addition, gaps exist in preparation for the impact on health care systems, the maintenance of essential services, and public health interventions to curb the spread of an epidemic [9] . Similar issues have been highlighted by researchers and planners world wide [10, 11] . Recently, pandemic H1N1 (2009) has reignited these concerns about preparedness.

In an effort to learn from SARS and to prepare for a future pandemic, the Government of Canada has released the ""Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector"" [4] . Similarly, the majority of provincial and territorial governments have also released their regional plans [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (see Table 1 for selected features of pandemic plans in various jurisdictions). These documents guide health planning and responses at provincial and local levels. Government plans cover topics ranging from influenza surveillance, to the distribution of antiviral supplies, to communication and information dissemination. Although these plans are designed to protect all Canadian citizens, there continues to be a lack of dialogue or guidance to address the specialized needs of a pediatric population. Children may require specialized supplies, medications, and treatment. They also require additional supervision and family support [27] . Additionally, pandemic planning for children and families is often addressed locally, with little coordination among the various levels of planning [28] . This continued neglect of pediatrics, both by policy makers and researchers in pandemic planning, is problematic, as difficulties associated with psychosocial concerns or ethical decision-making are magnified for HCP, children and families [29] . In this paper, we present both provincial and territorial policy statements as they relate to pediatrics based on a website review of plans. We also present the qualitative results from a survey administered to pediatric pandemic planning practitioners and policy makers. The goal of the project is to assess the comprehensiveness of existing pandemic plans in Canada and to identify what professionals identified as important and needed in pediatric plans. 

There is little dialogue about ethical concerns in pandemic planning for pediatrics. As such, the literature about ethics in pandemic planning focuses primarily on adult care [30] [31] [32] . Thompson and colleagues have identified general values to guide care and policy for pandemic planning. These values include: the duty to provide care, equity, individual liberty, privacy, proportionality, protection of the public from harm, reciprocity, solidarity, stewardship, and trust [30] . Although these values are central to ethical planning and decision-making, many may be interpreted differently in pediatrics. For example, individual liberty does not apply to children in the same way as adults. Compared to adults, children lack autonomy and parents must advocate and make health care decisions on their child's behalf. Due to the lack of literature on this topic, policy makers must individually interpret the ethical issues in pediatric care. As such, policy makers who strive to maintain ethical care in pediatrics should be guided by ethical values, and stay aware of the needs of children and families. In this paper, participants identify situations where such ethical policy making must be implemented.

In this paper, we present a website review of provincial and territorial pandemic plans with respect to pediatric policies. Additionally, we present the qualitative results from a national survey on pandemic planning.

Websites of all Canadian provinces and territories, and the Public Health Agency of Canada were reviewed to identify online and publicly available pandemic plans. Each website was surveyed to identify the availability of a pandemic plan. Subsequently, these plans were reviewed to assess their comprehensiveness and to identify unique plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. The review was completed in June 2009 by a reviewer with a background in health policy. The reviewer used content analysis to record all references to pediatrics in a database. To verify this information, the plans were read by a second reviewer, and a search function was used to ensure that available pediatric plan information was included in the review.

The web-based survey included open-ended questions that asked participants' opinions on the processes of planning, comprehensiveness and essential elements of pandemic plans in their organization or region.

The survey was hosted by Survey Monkey (http://www. surveymonkey.com/), an online application that administers questionnaires to participants. This method was chosen to increase the response rate from participants across Canada, particularly in more remote regions. An email with a link to the online survey was sent to potential participants between May and June 2008. Participants received a reminder email at 1 and 3 months after the initial request. The survey was available online in English and French.

Survey participants included individuals with expertise in pediatric care and pandemic planning, including: (1) members of national, provincial and territorial pandemic influenza committees; (2) professionals working in infection control and pandemic planning; and (3) professionals working with children, youth and families in crisis. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling.

Email invitations to complete the survey were sent to 1964 individuals, with n = 290 participants, with a response rate of 14.8%. Given this low response rate, the survey data presented is not intended to be representative. The demographic data, however, show that there are participants from all areas of pediatric care and pandemic planning. In addition, respondents from all provinces and territories participated in the survey (see Table 1 ). As such, the data identifies issues that are salient for participants who are interested and involved in the area, which may be important to consider in pandemic planning for children and families.

Open-ended survey responses were analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. A thematic analysis was conducted for each survey question using open coding. Qualitative rigor was ensured through the use of referential adequacy, negative case analysis, and peer debriefing.

Government decision-makers have learned from SARS, using this knowledge to plan for future pandemics, evidenced by the release of detailed pandemic plans. Largely, however, the application of this knowledge to pediatrics has been lacking. Specific references to pediatrics are seen in a minority of pandemic plans [4, 13, 22] , but a greater focus on pediatrics has been noted in some recently released plans [12, 15] . Some plans do not acknowledge pediatrics as a need [18, 21, 26] , while other plans suggest that the needs of this vulnerable population are being planned for, yet they do not articulate many concrete strategies to accomplish this task [16, 17, 19, [23] [24] [25] . This omission of pediatric care in pandemic plans continues despite concerns of a potential outbreak, and the responsibility of governments to coordinate a pandemic influenza response for Canadian children and families (see Table 2 ).

Governments with pandemic plans that address needs in pediatrics have solid contingency plans for medical and policy issues, but less so for psychosocial and ethical issues. Medical components of plans focus on key issues such as: pediatric specific medical supplies; stockpiling of antivirals and vaccines; and differences in symptoms, triage, treatment and isolation [4, [12] [13] [14] 23] .

Policy issues included in current plans address needs for coordination with other agencies as well as the public. These issues are often coupled with guidelines on school closures [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] , and only Ontario's plan addresses child care provisions for HCP [22] .

Chiefly, psychosocial and ethical concerns focus on communication [4, [12] [13] [14] 22] ; potential stressors for children and families [4, [12] [13] [14] [15] 17, 22, 24] ; grief and bereavement counselling [4, 13, 22] ; and family centred care [22] . Nevertheless, even these more thorough plans lack consideration of certain psychosocial and ethical issues, for example, 'how will decisions be made regarding children whose parents are unable to consent due to treatment?'. And 'how will children and families cope with these stressful events?'. Many such concerns, relevant to pediatric patients, families and HCP, are not documented in pediatric pandemic plans.

Notably, the above mentioned plans all contain a pediatric specific focus; in contrast, a majority of plans do not thoroughly consider these issues and tend to focus on medical and policy matters in pediatrics [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, 24, 26] . As a • Notes that pediatric specific supplies will be needed • Agencies must ""determine support needed for orphaned children and the need for grieving and counselling services"" • Mentions different needs of children in terms of vaccinations, isolation, treatment • Importance of supporting staff ""through critical incident debriefing, grief counselling, child care support, etc."" • Children's/Pediatric Unit is one area in which the demand may increase markedly and continuing operation is crucial-health authority and facilities should consider these areas and determine which are critical to keep them operational result, many provinces may be under prepared to deal with the increased demand for pediatric services, especially the need for psychosocial and ethical supports. Although many plans note differences in symptoms or treatment of children, and the need for school closures, still a number of these medical and policy needs are inadequately addressed and often psychosocial or ethical concerns are not touched upon at all. In fact, these issues present challenges often left unaddressed by government plans, resulting in a significant gap in pediatric pandemic planning.

Stakeholders in pediatric services and pandemic planning participated in this cross-Canada survey and sharing written responses to open-ended survey questions, providing their suggestions for pediatric pandemic planning. Participants identified four overarching themes about important needs in pediatric planning. Main themes include: essential elements to a pediatric pandemic plan; importance of children and families in planning; importance of communication; and accounting for missing or rudimentary plans.

Participants identified plan elements they thought were central to any organization's pediatric pandemic plan. They identified concerns from resource allocation to ethical decision-making, illustrating the complexity and heterogeneity of these issues.

Participants provided a wide range of elements they thought should be included in a pediatric pandemic plan. Many expressed the importance of child care measures during a pandemic. A variety of concerns pertaining to child care were identified, such as how to manage school and day care closures for working parents. By the same token, participants felt plans should provide support for HCP, in managing child care, family and job responsibilities, in addition to providing for occupational health concerns, including the psychosocial and physical well-being of HCP.

Moreover, participants felt that ensuring the availability of psychosocial supports for various stakeholders was also an essential plan element. They suggested that plans should make provisions to provide psychosocial supports for children, families, and HCP and their families.

Providing education and information were important to participants, to promote understanding and preparation during a pandemic. Similarly, they identified communication with stakeholder groups as essential in a pediatric pandemic plan.

Participants felt that policies should provide guidance in infection control in pediatrics. Coupled with these concerns, clinical guidelines were also identified as a central and complex issue in a pediatric pandemic plan. Participants saw the need for treatment guidelines specific to pediatric populations, including guidelines for assessment and treatment, for children with an infected or absent parent or guardian, and for prevention, such as vaccination protocols. Guidelines for the treatment of routine non-influenza health care cases were viewed as especially important to maintain care and to optimally treat the largest numbers of people. A participant stated, ""we must have specific pre-set criteria on questions such as: when to stop performing elective surgeries, when to stop performing marrow and organ transplants, etc.""

Resource allocation plans were a major concern, particularly for pediatric care, to ensure that resources are available for children and families during an outbreak. Participants noted that community supports are required for stakeholder groups, for example, child care and psychosocial supports for children with an ill parent or guardian.

Another key issue was coordinating plans to include home care for those who are infected if hospitals are over capacity.

A large portion of respondents also raised concerns about ethical decision-making during a pandemic, and the need for a framework for decision-making in pandemic plans. One respondent indicated the need for an ethical framework, specific to pediatrics:

Discussion/guidance [is needed] on ethical decisionmaking processes for the pediatric population. Are these different than they will be for the adult population? Will the philosophy of family centred care be impacted during a pandemic event?

In essence, participants identified a range of issues that must be considered in pediatric pandemic planning, in order to manage the heavy burden an outbreak will place on health care systems and resources (see Table 3 ).

Participants were asked to identify missing elements in their organization's pandemic plan, and many responded with similar issues as when questioned regarding the key elements of a pediatric plan. These missing elements include: child care plans; communication and information sharing; ethical guidelines; needs of HCP (psychosocial, medical, workforce); organizational coordination; pediatric focus; continued plan development; post-pandemic planning; psychosocial needs; and resource planning and allocation.

Participants were asked to identify if their organization actively involved children and families in pandemic planning. Those who responded affirmatively provided a range of strategies to incorporate the voices of children and families in plan development. Such strategies include input from: family advisory committees, community organizations, family representatives, and research findings. Consultation with children and families ranged from extensive involvement in planning, where a ""family representative was involved as a key stakeholder on the steering committee,"" to minimal, such as consulting research studies on pediatric needs.

Conversely, participants who responded that children and families were not involved in planning provided a variety of explanations regarding why this occurred. These explanations include: pediatrics are not within the organization's mandate, the organization has a small pediatric population, plans are in development, and planners and staff are also parents. The most common response has that staff and planners are also parents, and that they can apply this experience to plan development. As an example, a participant stated, [Children and families were] not [involved] to my knowledge, other than in the capacity that many of the people that have been involved in administrative or clinical care roles are also parents. They may have also been thinking in terms of being a parent.

Accordingly, based upon these survey responses, participants provided suggestions for, and noted barriers to, incorporating the voices of children and families in pandemic planning.

Participants provided information on preferred sources and methods of information dissemination during a pandemic. These sources include: business and industry, community organizations, government, HCP, professional organizations, the media, pandemic planning organizations, public health networks, schools and daycares.

Government was seen as a major source of information during a pandemic. One respondent suggested that, ""information on the flu would be put together by those responsible at the ministry of health.""

Methods of sharing information were varied, but largely web-based solutions were suggested by participants. Participants also identified media (e.g. television, radio, print) and interactive information sharing (e.g. town hall meetings) as key strategies.

Survey respondents belonging to organizations without, or lacking a well-developed plan, were asked to identify why their organization was wanting in the area of pediatric pandemic planning. Participants suggested that they were missing strong leadership in pediatrics and that this was a major factor contributing to a minimal or nonexistent plan. They felt that they had little guidance in what was required for pediatric pandemic planning. Participants also expressed that they did not have access to resources for plan development, resulting in a ""skeleton plan"" focused on the adult population. Lastly, not having adequate pediatric services or facilities within the organization or region contributed to the lack of a pediatric pandemic plan, as pediatrics was not a priority.

While most respondents advocated pediatric planning, some participants were doubtful about the need for specific plans. These dissenting participants suggested that there are no unique pediatric issues to be addressed and that general plans are sufficient for pediatric care. Other participants suggested that a pediatric plan was unnecessary because of a minimal focus on pediatrics, or due to a small pediatric population in their organization or region. The respondents who did not see the need for a specific plan provided responses such as, ""my belief is that it should not be a separate plan-I would need evidence or rationale why a separate pediatric pandemic plan is required."" On balance, the majority of respondents saw the need for a pediatric plan, but a substantial number of others did not see the implications or relevance of planning that is specific to children and families.

Participant responses indicate that pediatric pandemic planning is an important and salient issue across Canada. Based upon qualitative analyses of survey data, participants have provided important and useful feedback on the needs and essential elements in a pediatric pandemic plan, the importance of listening to children and families, the need for communication with stakeholder groups, and factors resulting in under-developed or missing plans. Unfortunately, however, not all recommendations from participants are currently being implemented in provincial and territorial plans. This is exemplified in the congruence between what respondents felt were essential plan elements and the elements they identified as missing from their organizational or regional plans. There are clear and notable gaps in pediatric planning, both in terms of elements reported as missing by participants in their organizations' or regions' pandemic plans and in the parallel gaps in the provincial, territorial and national policy documents that were reviewed. For example, a lack of psychosocial and ethical policies in planning for pediatric care were identified as major gaps by survey respondents, and confirmed by our policy review. These discontinuities in identified key elements, and existing policies, point to the need for consideration of children and families at all levels of the planning process. Moreover, this lack of pediatric specific considerations is noted in the perceptions of survey respondents who indicated that children do not have unique needs in the event of a pandemic and in the lack of policies across provinces and territories pertaining directly to the care of children and families. To address the needs of this population effectively, the authors suggest the incorporation of pediatric plans within broader provincial, territorial and national plans.

The international literature on needs in pandemic planning notes the importance of cooperation and the need to identify roles and responsibilities in plans [9, 11] . Similarly, participants identified the importance of resource allocation, guidelines and communication in pediatric plans. It is clear that these issues are salient and must guide policymakers as they develop or update plans.

Based upon the web-based policy review, provinces with a combination of factors are often substantially more prepared based upon an analysis of their provided policies. For instance, British Columbia's (BC) [10] pediatric pandemic plan is a well-developed and readily available document which addresses the unique issues of children and families and touches upon some psychosocial concerns. Likewise, BC is an example of a province with relative wealth, and a high population density in urban areas, for instance, BC reported the third highest population growth among the provinces during 2007 (14.9 per 1000) to reach a population of 4,414,000, one of the more populated provinces in Canada [33] . BC's major cities are easily accessible via commercial travel, and the province has welldeveloped health care and government infrastructure, all of which likely contribute to the resources available for the development of a pediatric pandemic plan.

In contrast, Northern communities appear to be at the greatest risk, given current rudimentary plans that are potentially influenced by a lower population density, few major cities, and a lack of reserve human, medical, supply, policy and financial resources. These disparities require greater consideration of factors influencing inequities in pediatric pandemic preparedness, including population density, socioeconomic status, relative isolation, and available resources. Regardless of the factors that may influence the lack of pediatric contingency plans, there remains the possibility of severe outcomes for children and families in the event of an outbreak. It appears that greater attention and resources must be allocated to Northern communities to ensure adequate preparation in the event of a pandemic.

Participants suggested that web based communication will be key in the event of a severe outbreak, allowing information to be distributed remotely [34] . Posting pandemic information on websites will be critical, as identified by survey respondents, to allow quick access to up-todate information. The majority of provincial, territorial and national pandemic planning bodies have responded to this method of information dissemination, in posting pandemic plans and information on their websites.

Public and political awareness of a potential pandemic has raised concerns over resource allocation and contingency planning, but in some jurisdictions, relatively little attention has been paid to planning in pediatrics. A review of the pandemic plans of the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial and territorial governments has identified needs in pediatric planning. These issues and concerns were also supported by survey respondents, who are experts in pediatric care and pandemic planners, qualified to note such gaps in contingency plans. To overcome these gaps, a focus on the unique needs of children and families is required, while support and resource redistribution to less advantaged provinces and territories is needed to ensure the health and well-being of all Canadians. Consideration of the factors that influence pandemic preparedness (such as population density, affluence, relative isolation, and available resources) may be helpful to inform research and policy decisions. Finally, the dissemination of information online, especially via government websites, is essential to communicate with the public during a pandemic. In brief, the findings presented here provide important suggestions to guide pandemic planning in pediatrics, in the hope that a pandemic response can ensure the safety of Canadians.
