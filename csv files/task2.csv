Respiratory disease in pregnancy,Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy. Asthma affects about 7% of women of childbearing age. Treatment is the same as for the non-pregnant population and most drugs are safe in pregnancy. Educating women to continue preventer inhaled corticosteroid therapy will reduce the risk of attacks. Respiratory infections are associated with a higher morbidity in pregnancy and should be treated aggressively. Most chronic pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. Large reserves in respiratory function allow the fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. The use of chest X-rays should not be avoided in pregnancy. Women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with the respiratory team. The presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale is associated with a high risk of death in pregnancy.,"Severe chest disease leading to respiratory failure is uncommon in women of childbearing age but respiratory symptoms are extremely common in pregnancy. This is in part an effect of the physiological adaptation of the respiratory and vascular systems to pregnancy and in part because of limited functional capacity and mobility from diaphragmatic elevation by the gravid uterus in late gestation. Oxygen consumption is increased by 20% from early pregnancy, minute ventilation by 40-50% secondary to tidal volume increase, and maternal hyperventilation results in a mild fully compensated respiratory alkalosis (increased arterial pO 2 and decreased arterial pCO 2 , compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to 18-22 mmol/l; arterial pH 7.44).

The commonest respiratory symptom in pregnancy is breathlessness. Although not the subject of this article, pulmonary embolus and cardiac causes are important differential diagnoses, but it is most commonly the increased awareness of the physiological hyperventilation of pregnancy which leads to a subjective feeling of breathlessness. Women most often present in the third trimester but may become symptomatic at any gestation. Classically physiological breathlessness of pregnancy is present at rest or while talking and paradoxically improves with activity. Table 1 summarises other causes. Other presenting symptoms of respiratory disease include chest pain, cough, sputum production, haemoptysis, fever or cyanosis.

On examination, respiratory rate is unchanged by pregnancy. Presence of raised temperature should be noted. Expansion on inspiration reflects tidal volume and is reduced in many respiratory diseases. Percussion note may be dull in the presence of pleural effusion, consolidation, collapse or fibrosis. It is enhanced in the presence of a pneumothorax. Auscultation may reveal wheezes indicative of asthma, fine crepitations in the presence of pulmonary oedema and pleural rubs indicative of inflammatory conditions of the pleura in pneumonia or pulmonary infarction; and bronchial breathing+coarse crackles suggest consolidation. Absent breath sounds occur with pneumothorax or extensive collapse.

A simple non-invasive investigation is transcutaneous oxygen saturation. The normal oxygen saturation is 495%. A fall in saturation on exercise, e.g. climbing stairs, indicates some form of cardiopulmonary disease and should be investigated further. Measurement of arterial blood gases should be reserved for those who are markedly breathless, those whose oxygen saturations are low at rest or which drop on exercise, and those who appear unwell. Reluctance to perform a chest X-ray in pregnancy may delay a diagnosis. Ionising radiation from a chest X-ray is approximately 0.2 rad (o5% of the maximum recommended exposure in pregnancy) and abdominal shielding will reduce fetal exposure further. Sputum should be sent for microbiological examination.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the lung airways characterised by episodes of reversible bronchoconstriction as a result of various stimuli. It affects up to 7% of women of childbearing age. It may present with episodes of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness or cough. Signs classically include a diffuse, bilateral, expiratory (7inspiratory) wheeze and tachypnoea but are often absent. There may be an associated personal or family history of atopy and recognised triggers include pollen, dust, animals and infections. Objectively the diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) as an indication of the degree of bronchoconstriction. A 420% diurnal variation on X3 days in a week for 2 weeks on PEF diary or FEV 1 X15% increase after a trial of a b 2 agonist or steroid tablets or a similar decrease after 6 minutes of exercise are diagnostic. PEFR and FEV 1 are unaffected by pregnancy.

Atopy is often associated with asthma. It has no effect on pregnancy and drugs used in the treatment of hayfever (the antihistamines most commonly used with best safety profile are chlorpheniramine and intranasal beclomethasone) may be safely prescribed.

Effect of asthma on pregnancy: Although a number of small studies have suggested an association of asthma with the development of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm birth and low birthweights, most pregnancies are unaffected by the effects of asthma. Severe poorly controlled asthma resulting in episodes of maternal hypoxaemia could, however, give rise to such complications. It is therefore of concern that many women stop their medication at the start of the pregnancy because of concerns regarding the safety profile of these drugs for the fetus. In a recent US study, between 5 and 13 weeks' gestation there was a 23% reduction in use of inhaled corticosteroids, 13% reduction in short-acting b 2 -agonists and a 54% reduction in rescue steroids.

Effect of pregnancy on asthma: Asthma can worsen, improve or remain unchanged in pregnancy. Endogenous steroids in labour ensure that acute asthma attacks are very uncommon during labour and delivery. There may be a deterioration postpartum.

Management: Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to optimise therapy. Ideally, this should occur pre-pregnancy. A pre-conceptual visit would allow time to optimise therapy and educate women regarding the importance and safety of continuing their medication to ensure good asthma control throughout pregnancy. Inhaler techniques should be checked and home peak flow monitoring encouraged. Pregnant women should be monitored closely so that any change in course can be matched by an appropriate change in therapy. Smoking should be discouraged.

Drug therapy in pregnancy is essentially the same as for the non-pregnant population and should follow the British Thoracic Society guidelines on the management of asthma. A stepwise approach is recommended (Figure 1 ). Inhaled b 2 -agonists, inhaled and oral steroids, oral and intravenous theophyllines and intravenous magnesium sulphate should be used as normal. Only leukotriene antagonists are not recommended because of limited data, although the guidelines suggest that it is safer to continue these in women who are already taking them and who are resistant to the other therapies.

Acute asthma attacks should be managed aggressively as an emergency in hospital. Multidisciplinary care from obstetricians, respiratory physicians and, in severe cases, ITU staff will ensure that appropriate treatment as for the non-pregnant patients is administered (Table 2) . Continuous oxygen to maintain saturation above 95% and continuous fetal monitoring should be instigated. A PEFR of 33-50% best/predicted indicates acute severe asthma attack;o33% is life-threatening. Other concerning signs are SpO 2 o92%, pO 2 o8 kPa with normal pCO 2 , silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory effort, hypotension, altered consciousness and exhaustion.

If caesarean section is required, regional blockade is preferable to general anaesthesia in women with asthma and opiates should be avoided for pain relief, especially in the presence of an acute

Prostaglandin E 2 does not cause bronchoconstriction and may used for induction of labour. Prostaglandin F 2a should be used only in extreme circumstances in the management of postpartum haemorrhage and with caution since it may precipitate an acute attack. Likewise aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, although if aspirin is indicated for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis, and there is a history of aspirin exposure without problems, then it should be safe to use. Encourage women to continue their regular medication in labour. Those women taking 47.5 mg prednisolone tablets for 42 weeks prior to the onset of labour require parenteral hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-8 hourly during labour. Ergometrine has been reported to cause bronchospasm but syntometrine routinely used for active management of the third stage does not.

Postpartum, breastfeeding may reduce the incidence of asthma in the child and should be encouraged. None of the medications for asthma is contraindicated in breastfeeding.

Pneumonia occurs in the pregnant population with a frequency equal to that in the general population.

Effects of pregnancy on pneumonia: Pneumonia in pregnancy is often more virulent and mortality is higher than in the nonpregnant population. The spectrum of pathogens is similar to that in the non-pregnant population and the management does not differ. Coexisting maternal disease, including asthma and anaemia, and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of contracting pneumonia.

Effect of pneumonia on pregnancy: Severe pneumonia may precipitate preterm delivery and result in low birthweight infants. There is an increased risk of serious maternal complications, including respiratory failure.

Clinical features: Women may present with cough, fever, rigors, breathlessness and pleuritic pain. Signs include fever, purulent sputum, coarse crackles on auscultation and signs of consolidation. Diagnosis may be confirmed with a chest X-ray. Blood and sputum cultures should be taken. Bacterial pneumonia is associated with a raised white blood cell count, although mycoplasma pneumonia is not. Knowledge of the increased mycoplasma activity in the community during an epidemic period may help guide the clinician to the increased likelihood of mycoplasma infection. Mycoplasma and chlamydial pneumonias are diagnosed on serological assays with complement fixation tests.

Management: Supportive measures in the management of pregnant women with pneumonia include oxygen administration if there is evidence of hypoxia, and rehydration especially in the presence of fever. Chest physiotherapy will help clear secretions and aid oxygenation. Oral antibiotic therapy should be commenced for community acquired bacterial infections -oral amoxicillin (0.5-1 g t.d.s.) and clarithromycin (500 mg b.d.) are the current recommended strategies. For severe community acquired or hospital acquired infections intravenous cefuroxime and clarithromycin should be used. Tetracyclines cause discolouration of the teeth in the fetus and should be avoided after 20 weeks' gestation.

Community-acquired pneumonia is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. b-Lactam and macrolide antibiotics are safe in pregnancy and are effective in treating community acquired infections.

Viral pneumonia Viral respiratory infections, including varicella, influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), may present in pregnancy and are associated with a worse outcome than in the non-pregnant population. Current antiviral and respiratory therapies can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guidelines on the treatment of varicella infection in pregnancy recommend that all non-immune pregnant women exposed to varicella should be given zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) as soon as possible. Those who develop clinical varicella should be treated with aciclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and after 20 weeks' gestation since mortality and morbidity is higher at advanced gestations. Hospital admission should be arranged in the event of respiratory deterioration, neurological symptoms, haemorrhagic rash and bleeding, or in the presence of a dense rash with mucosal lesions. Delivery during a viraemic period is hazardous with maternal risks of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatitis. Supportive treatment and intravenous aciclovir may be necessary. There is a high risk of varicella transmission to the newborn with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, VZIG should be given to the newborn after delivery (if maternal infection occurred within 5 days pre and 2 days post-delivery). If the neonate develops varicella, aciclovir should be commenced.

Influenza vaccination can reduce the prevalence of hospitalisations among pregnant women during the influenza season and is not contraindicated in pregnancy.

Give high flow oxygen b 2 -agonist bronchodilators High-dose inhaled b 2 -agonists by oxygen-driven nebuliser Ipratropium bromide Add nebulised ipratropium bromide (0.5 mg 4-6 hourly) if poor response to bronchodilators or severe acute asthma Steroid therapy Systemic steroids (40-50 mg/day) in all cases for at least 5 days or until recovery Other therapies Consider single dose intravenous magnesium sulphate (1.2-2 g infusion over 20 minutes) Routine antibiotics are not recommended 

Pneumocystis pneumonia in association with HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is the most common opportunistic infection in patients progressing to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and continues to carry significant maternal risk to the immunocompromised population. It should be suspected in the presence of profound hypoxia out of proportion to the chest X-ray findings, and bronchoscopy should be considered. Treatment is with high-dose co-trimoxazole (Septrin)7pentamidine, usually contraindicated in pregnancy because of the theoretical risks of neonatal kernicterus and haemolysis. However, in the presence of PCP the benefits of treatment outweigh these risks and women with HIV and a past history of PCP or with a CD4+ cell count ofo200 cells/ml should receive prophylactic Septrin or nebulised pentamidine when embarking on pregnancy.

This is an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which characteristically causes caseating granulomas, usually involving the lungs as the primary site. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide is rising, in part due to the susceptibility to TB of HIVinfected patients, and in the UK is more prevalent amongst Asian and African immigrants. In pregnancy recent studies have suggested a high prevalence (50%) of extrapulmonary TB (at sites such as lymph nodes, bone, liver, spleen, bone marrow, caecum, nervous system and eye). The patient is often asymptomatic but typically can present with a cough, haemoptysis, weight loss and night sweats. The diagnosis is confirmed with sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl-Neelsen stain).

Although pregnancy and TB have little effect on each other, treatment should not be delayed in pregnancy. Because of a rising incidence of drug-resistant TB, treatment is often with prolonged courses of multiple chemotherapeutic agents at the advice of the respiratory physicians. The usual drugs given are rifampicin (no proven adverse fetal effects but risk of maternal hepatotoxicity), isoniazid (in combination with pyridoxine 50 mg/day to reduce the risk of peripheral neuritis), pyrazinamide and/or ethambutol. Liver function should be monitored monthly. Streptomycin is associated with eighth nerve damage and should therefore be avoided. After delivery the neonate should be given prophylactic isoniazid treatment if the mother is sputum positive. The infant should also be vaccinated as soon as possible. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated since very little of the drugs are excreted in breast milk.

This is a complication of gastric regurgitation often at the time of a general anaesthetic in late pregnancy (usually at caesarean section). It may also occur in the event of an excessively high regional block. Increased intra-abdominal pressure, delayed gastric emptying and reduced gastro-oesophageal sphincter tone contribute to the risk. Ranitidine, an H 2 antagonist, which reduces gastric acid secretion and an antacid which neutralises the gastric acid are now routinely prescribed for women in labour with risk factors for caesarean section or prior to an elective procedure. The last confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (2000) (2001) (2002) reported one death from gastric aspiration in an obese woman (BMI 435) following failure to intubate the trachea after induction for general anaesthesia.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive disorder affecting the body's exocrine glands, including the pancreas, sweat glands and lungs. It results from a gene deletion in 70% of cases and has a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 caucasians. A resultant defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein causes impaired movement of water and electrolytes across epithelial surfaces. Formerly, CF patients rarely lived to adulthood, but improvements in treatment have meant more women with CF are now reaching reproductive age and wish to become pregnant. The signs and symptoms of CF vary, depending on the severity of the disease and the degree of bacterial infection. Some cases are very mild and may not be diagnosed until adulthood. CF is characterised by the production of very thick and sticky mucus. The ducts leading from the pancreas become obstructed, causing pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes and malnutrition. About 90% of CF cases involve the lungs with recurrent or persistent infections, development of bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. A productive cough is almost always present, and very often patients appear barrel-chested. Frequent hospitalisations are a result of recurring respiratory, gastrointestinal and nutritional problems.

Effect of cystic fibrosis on pregnancy: Female fertility may be impaired because of malnutrition or thickened cervical mucus but is usually normal. Men are usually sterile. Most reported series of pregnancies in women with CF have shown that with careful planning and close monitoring by a dedicated CF team, pregnancy outcomes are favourable. Commonly reported adverse events are IUGR and prematurity, which includes iatrogenic early delivery in unwell women.

Effect of pregnancy on cystic fibrosis: Pregnancy does not affect disease severity or cause deterioration in the patient's condition. Maternal mortality is not significantly greater than non-pregnant age-matched women with CF except in the presence of pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis, arterial hypoxaemia (oxygen saturationo90%), severe lung disease (FEV 1 o60% predicted) and/or malnutrition when both maternal and fetal outcome may be poor.

Management: The risk of a child being born with CF is 2-2.5% if the carrier status of the father is unknown (based on the UK carrier status of 1 in 25) and 50% if the father is heterozygous for the gene. Therefore pre-conceptual genetic counselling is important. During the pregnancy, regular assessment of fetal growth should be planned to detect early signs of fetal growth restriction.

Ideally women with CF planning a pregnancy should be seen and assessed pre-conceptually. Women with mild disease can then be reassured that pregnancy is safe and liaison may be planned ahead between a CF centre and an obstetrician with a special interest in CF.

Screening for diabetes and baseline lung function tests can be performed. Dietary supplementation and enzyme supplements can be commenced to optimise the patient's condition prior to conception and continued throughout pregnancy. Women with CF are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes. Chest physiotherapy and prophylactic antibiotics may be implemented prior to conception and continued throughout the pregnancy. Infective chest exacerbations should be treated aggressively with antibiotic therapy.

Conversely, if pre-conceptually the patient is found to have pulmonary hypertension complicating the CF, cor pulmonale or an FEV 1 o30-40%, she may be counselled regarding the associated high risk and be strongly advised against pregnancy. Effective contraception should also be discussed in such cases.

In order to achieve a successful outcome, multidisciplinary management aims to ensure adequate maternal nutrition, control of pulmonary infection and avoidance of prolonged hypoxia. Women may develop symptoms of breathlessness or evidence of hypoxia in late pregnancy. Admission for bed rest and oxygen therapy should be arranged. Delivery should be planned if their clinical condition deteriorates further.

There is no contraindication to vaginal delivery but a prolonged second stage should be avoided because of the susceptibility of these patients to pneumothoraces. General anaesthesia should be avoided. There is no contraindication to breastfeeding but women may need to continue nutritional supplements postpartum.

Bronchiectasis is a sequela of CF, pneumonias and rarer causes such as Kartagener's syndrome. It is characterised by irreversibly dilated damaged bronchi predisposing to persistently infected mucus and bacterial infections. A cough productive of large amounts of sputum is characteristic. The condition is uncommon in the childbearing years but there is some evidence to suggest an association with IUGR when present in pregnancy. Women should be managed jointly with respiratory physicians and their condition can deteriorate in pregnancy. Close attention to postural drainage and physiotherapy will help. Regular sputum cultures and treatment of chest infections are necessary intermittently or continuously if recurrent infections are frequent. The use of bronchodilators may help. As in CF, the presence of pulmonary hypertension and/or hypoxaemia adversely affects prognosis.

There are few data regarding pregnancy outcome in women following lung transplant. Of a series of 10 pregnancies in 10 women who were CF lung transplant recipients, five with a long stable interval of 43 years between transplant and the pregnancy had favourable outcomes; the remaining five had preterm deliveries. All 10, however, showed progressive decline in lung function and all died of chronic rejection within 38 months of delivery.

Restrictive ventilatory defects characterised by a reduction in lung volumes and an increase in the ratio of FEV 1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) occur when lung expansion is limited because of alterations in the lung parenchyma or because of abnormalities in the pleura, chest wall or neuromuscular apparatus. The majority of pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. A large reserve in respiratory function allows fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. FVC of 41 l or 50% of predicted have been suggested as a cut-off for successful pregnancies and although more severe cases can negotiate pregnancy, patients with severe restrictive lung disease should be advised to avoid pregnancy or consider a therapeutic termination. Associated polycythaemia causing hyperviscosity may add to the thrombotic risk during a pregnancy. Women with an associated kyphoscoliosis are often delivered prematurely because of deterioration in lung function. Mode of delivery tends to be caesarean section because of abnormal fetal presentation. Each case should be assessed individually.

Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating epithelioid granulomas that may affect any organ system. The aetiology of the disease remains unknown. The disease most commonly involves granuloma formation in the lungs. Other commonly involved organ systems include the lymph nodes (especially the intrathoracic nodes), skin, eyes, liver, heart, and nervous, musculoskeletal, renal and endocrine systems.

The course of sarcoidosis is variable, ranging from self-limited acute disease to a chronic debilitating disease that may result in death. Spontaneous remissions occur in nearly two-thirds of patients, but 10-30% of patients have a more chronic or progressive course. Because sarcoidosis can involve any organ system, the clinical presentation is often variable. Many patients are asymptomatic but there may be chest symptoms. Other features include erythema nodosum, anterior uveitis, hypercalcaemia, arthropathy, fever or central nervous system symptoms.

Effect of pregnancy on sarcoidosis: According to reported series, sarcoidosis either does not change in pregnancy or if it changes, improves, possibly because of the increased circulating cortisol. However, there is a tendency to relapse in the puerperium. This should not be a contraindication to pregnancy except in severely affected cases pre-pregnancy. Factors indicating a poor prognosis include parenchymal lesions on chest X-ray, advanced radiographic staging, advanced maternal age, low inflammatory activity, requirement for drugs other than steroids and presence of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.

Effect of sarcoidosis on pregnancy: Sarcoidosis does not adversely affect pregnancy and is not transmitted to the fetus. There is one report of sarcoid granulomata found in the placenta of one patient.

Management: Ideally patients require evaluation before pregnancy to establish chronicity, baseline pulmonary function, inflammatory activity, staging and response to treatment. Systemic steroids should be continued in pregnancy. Angiotensin converting enzyme levels, used as a marker of disease activity, are unreliable in pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid vitamin D because of the risk of hypercalcaemia. Intravenous hydrocortisone should be administered in labour in women taking 47.5 mg/day of prednisolone.

Wegener's granulomatosis This is a rare form of systemic vasculitis in which necrotising granulomatous lesions affect the upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. Without treatment the condition has a poor prognosis. Remission may be achieved with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, a teratogenic drug. Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy until remission has been achieved and to wait at least 3 months following cessation of cyclophosphamide before conceiving. Cyclophosphamide may also cause ovarian failure.

Pregnancy has been associated with exacerbation of disease activity and cyclophosphamide has been used in the latter half of pregnancy, causing a fetal leucopenia. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titres are markers of disease activity but their reliability in pregnancy has not been evaluated.

Amniotic fluid embolism is fortunately rare (1 in 80 000) but should be suspected when a woman presents with a sudden onset of hypoxia (with dysnoea, cyanosis or respiratory arrest), collapse, an acute hypotensive crises or disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemorrhage in the absence of any other explanation. Onset is usually during labour, caesarean section or within 30 minutes of delivery. It has also been described during dilatation and curettage procedures. Management is supportive with early involvement of the intensive care team. The aim is to achieve adequate oxygenation with ventilatory support, invasive monitoring to maintain good cardiac output and correction of a coagulopathy. Mortality rate is 480%. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear. It is thought to be due to the passage of amniotic fluid and debris into the maternal circulation, precipitating an anaphylactic-like reaction. Fetal squames are however present in the circulation of healthy pregnant women without any consequences.

Bronchial carcinoma accounts for 95% of all primary tumours of the lungs. Although the incidence continues to rise in women, few cases have been reported in pregnancy. The commonest presenting symptoms are cough, chest discomfort and haemoptysis and chest X-ray may demonstrate round shadows. Metastasis has been reported in the pericardium and placenta. Lymphomas may also present with respiratory symptoms.

The strength of association between cigarette smoking and bronchial carcinoma overshadows any other aetiological risk factors and 20-30% of pregnant women report smoking in the developed world. Few will stop on becoming pregnant but focused counselling by specialist staff has been shown to be more effective than other measures, with more than doubling of cessation rates. The effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy have yet to be established. Besides maternal morbidity, smoking adversely affects the pregnancy by doubling the risk of premature delivery, both spontaneous and iatrogenic, as a result of placental abruption and lowers the mean birth weight. Reduced ovarian and tubal function and implantation predispose to subfertility, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. The use of chest X-rays when underlying disease is suspected should not be avoided in pregnancy and most drugs can be used safely in pregnancy. It is important that women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education regarding the risks of pregnancy and the importance of continuing their medications. It also provides the opportunity to optimise their condition and so reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with regular review by chest physicians and access to chest physiotherapy if necessary. Liaison with obstetric anaesthetists in the antenatal period will optimise care at delivery with regard to pain relief and reduce anaesthetic risks. Respiratory diseases complicated by pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale have a poor prognosis in pregnancy.F

Pneumonia in pregnancy is often more virulent and therefore should be treated aggressively All non-immune pregnant women exposed to varicella should be given zoster immunoglobulin (

Exercise and infection risk,"After studying this chapter, you should be able to . . . 1. Describe the J-shaped model of upper respiratory tract infection risk and exercise volume. 2. Evaluate the evidence concerning moderate exercise and upper respiratory tract infection risk. 3. Evaluate the evidence concerning heavy exercise and upper respiratory tract infection risk.","Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) such as coughs and colds, throat infections and middle ear infections are a leading cause of visits to general practitioners throughout the world (Graham 1990) . Given that the average adult suffers from two to five colds each year (Heath et al 1992) it is not surprising that the socioeconomic consequences of these illnesses are considerable in terms of days lost from work and costs of medical consultation, care and over-the-counter remedies. As such, these illnesses present a real concern to the wellbeing of both athletes and the general population and therefore an understanding of the relationship between physical activity and infection risk is of great importance.

The J-shaped model 2 Moderate exercise and risk of URTI 2 Anecdotal reports 2 Epidemiological data 3 Moderate exercise and URTI symptoms 5 Possible mechanisms 6

The J-shaped model of the relationship between exercise and URTI risk It has been hypothesized that the relationship between exercise intensity/volume and susceptibility to URTI is J-shaped (Nieman 1994, Fig. 1.1) . According to this model, taking part in some regular moderate physical activity decreases the relative risk of URTI below that of a sedentary individual. However, performing prolonged, high-intensity exercise or periods of strenuous exercise training is associated with an above-average risk of URTI. When first proposed, the J-shaped model was based on the findings of a relatively small number of studies and the majority of these explored the relationship between heavy exercise and URTI risk. There has been further interest in this area in recent years, particularly with regard to the relationship between moderate exercise and incidence of URTI. This provides us with additional evidence to consider when assessing the relationship between exercise and infection risk and we can now more effectively evaluate the validity of the J-shaped model.

Athletes and fitness enthusiasts have long supported the idea that 'keeping fit' confers some protection against infection. In a survey examining the long-term health value of endurance exercise training, responses from 750 'Masters Athletes' (age range 40-81 years) suggested that 76% considered themselves as 'less vulnerable to illness than their peers' and 68% regarded their quality of life as 'much better than that of their sedentary friends' (Shephard et al 1995) . In a further survey of 170 nonelite marathon runners, 90% agreed with the statement that they 'rarely get sick' (Nieman 2000) . Thus, anecdotal reports such as these certainly support the J-shaped model concerning the relationship between moderate exercise and infection risk. However, these reports alone by no means validate this portion of the J-shaped model; data from experimental and epidemiological studies needs to be considered.

On the whole, the studies that have looked at the relationship between moderate (and more intense) exercise and infection risk have been survey-based epidemiological studies. In the majority of these studies, a physician has not diagnosed an episode of URTI; rather, subjects have completed a questionnaire or a daily logbook in which they noted their symptoms of illness (including URTI) either during the study or retrospectively. For example, in one randomized exercise training study that is typical of many of the studies carried out on this topic, subjects recorded health problems each day by means of codes including: cold (runny nose, cough, sore throat), allergy (itchy eyes, stuffy nose), headache, fever, nausea/vomiting/ diarrhoea, fatigue/tiredness, muscle/joint/bone problem or injury, menstrual cramps, other (describe), or none (Nieman et al 1990b) . An episode of URTI was defined as coding for a cold with or without supporting symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue/tiredness or nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea for 48 hours and separated from a previous episode by at least 1 week. In most studies, physical activity patterns are also assessed by questionnaire. These studies have the advantage in that they allow large cohorts to be studied, although the reliability of the data gained from these studies may depend upon the experimental design; for example, memory recall over long periods of time has obvious potential for error. One study that illustrates both of these points examined the relationship between physical activity patterns and episodes of URTI in 199 young Dutch adults (age range 20-23 years) (Schouten et al 1988) . The 92 men and 107 women were asked to recall habitual physical activity over the previous 3 months and symptoms of URTI over the previous 6 months. In both the men and women, the incidence and duration of URTI symptoms was not related to total physical activity, although a significant, albeit very weak, negative correlation was found between sports activity (range 0-480 minutes/week) and incidence of URTI in the women (r = −0.18). However, despite the large cohort studied, the long period of recall used in this study may call the reliability of these findings into question.

In a smaller-scale study, a group of 36 previously sedentary, mildly obese young women (body mass index of ~28 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to either 15 weeks of exercise training or to a control group who did not participate in any exercise outside normal daily activity (Nieman et al 1990b) . The exercise training was supervised and comprised five 45-minute sessions of brisk walking at 60% heart rate reserve each week. Symptoms of illness were recorded daily in a logbook and, importantly, all of the women were unaware of the aims of the study. Over the 15-week study period, the actual number of URTI episodes did not differ between the two groups. However, the women in the exercising group reported significantly fewer days with URTI symptoms compared with the sedentary controls (5.1 ± 1.2 days versus 10.8 ± 2.3 days in the exercising and control groups, respectively; Fig. 1 .2).

Thus, it appears that the exercising women were able to 'get over' their colds more quickly. In a similar study, 14 previously sedentary elderly women (aged 67-85) completed 12 weeks of supervised brisk walking (Nieman et al 1993) with another group of 16 of their sedentary peers participating in supervised sessions of callisthenics (light exercise involving muscular strength and flexibility work) over the same period. Only three of the walkers experienced an episode of URTI during the study period, compared with eight of the individuals in the callisthenics group. In addition, both groups were also compared with a group of 12 highly conditioned elderly women, who were still actively involved in endurance competitions; only one of these women experienced an episode of URTI during the same period. However, this study was performed during the autumn, and so may have been influenced by seasonal variations in exposure to pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease) and immune function. Nevertheless, in support of these findings, a prospective study performed over a whole year found that the number and duration of episodes of URTI in 61 men and women aged 66-84 years were negatively related with daily energy expenditure (Kostka et al 2000) , as assessed by questionnaire and daily logbooks. These subjects were involved only in moderate intensity activities, with the majority of the activities being performed indoors.

On the face of it, the findings of these studies certainly lend some support to the moderate exercise portion of the J-shaped model. However, it does raise the question of whether these findings are specific to the populations studied. For example, it may be that the elderly begin these investigations with a poorer level of immune function, and so any benefit of increased physical exercise may be more obvious (Shephard & Shek 1999) . In addition, other factors should also be considered. Nutritional status is known to influence immune function (as discussed further in Chs 8 and 9) and as such may be an important factor in determining an individual's susceptibility to infection; in the study of the elderly women, the well-conditioned group had a much higher dietary intake of energy and of several vitamins and minerals (Nieman et al 1993) . Psychological influences are also well known to affect measures of immune function (this is discussed further in Ch. 11), with decreases in measures of psychological stress associated with enhancement of several aspects of immune function. Interestingly, in both the elderly and younger, mildly obese women, participation in supervised exercise programmes was associated with increased feelings of general wellbeing (Cramer et al 1991 , Nieman et al 1993 . Furthermore, the selection criteria used may well present some degree of bias towards those with a 'healthy lifestyle'. The inclusion criteria for these studies may require individuals to be non-smokers and to be free from ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease; as such, these individuals may be less vulnerable to infection anyway. In support of this, a recent retrospective study found no relationship between habitual moderate physical activity and the incidence of colds in over 14 000 middle-aged smokers (Hemilä et al 2003) . These confounding factors aside, the findings of one recent study appear to give further support to the hypothesis that regular moderate exercise is associated with a lower incidence of URTI. The relationship between exercise and infection risk was explored across a broad range of age (from 20 to 70 years) and habitual physical activity level (Matthews et al 2002) . Over 500 adults were asked to recall episodes of colds (used to assess incidence of URTI), flu or allergic episodes at 3-month intervals over a period of a year. Explicit symptoms for assessment of URTI occurrence (e.g. runny nose, cough and sore throat) were not routinely recorded. Physical activity levels were assessed by 24-hour recall occurring on three occasions within 7 weeks of each URTI recall and took into consideration physical activity at home, work and during leisure time. The findings suggested that moderate physical activity was associated with a 20-30% reduction in annual risk of URTI, compared with low levels of activity. Although this study was based on 3-month recall of 'colds' rather than any specific symptoms of URTI, the patterns of seasonal variation in episodes of URTI were similar to others in the literature that have used more intensive assessment methods. As you can see in Figure 1 .3, colds were four times more prevalent in the winter months (November-March) than in the summer (June-August). In contrast, allergies were more common in the summertime. Furthermore, the data were also adjusted for many of the known risk factors for infection, such as age, smoking, anxiety, depression and dietary factors such as macronutrient and vitamin supplement intake.

On balance, the evidence from the available randomized controlled studies and larger survey-based studies does suggest some positive benefit of moderate exercise in reducing incidence of URTI. Furthermore, the finding that young women engaging in regular brisk walking compared with a sedentary lifestyle had fewer URTI symptom days suggests that moderate exercise may decrease URTI symptom severity and duration (Nieman et al 1990b) . One study to address this assertion in a controlled situation vaccinated 50 moderately trained college students with human Rhinovirus on two consecutive days (Weidner et al 1998) . Thirty-four of the students then went on to exercise at 70% heart rate reserve for 40 minutes every other day for 10 days, with the remaining 16 students assigned to a no-exercise condition. Over the 10 days, symptom severity and duration was assessed using a checklist and by weighing collected facial tissues. Throughout the 10 days post-vaccination, mean scores on the symptom questionnaire did not differ between the two groups, neither were there any differences in mass of the collected tissues. While these findings suggest that continuing to exercise during an URTI in moderately fit individuals does not affect symptom severity or duration, any extrapolation of these findings should be taken with caution. Human Rhinovirus accounts for only 40% of cold infections (Weidner et al 1998) and other cold-causing viruses, such as coronavirus, may have different symptom profiles because the immune response is specific to the invading pathogen. As this study investigated only Rhinovirus-caused URTI, this may account for the discrepancies between the findings of this study and those of Nieman et al (1990b) where the episodes of URTI experienced by the women were naturally occurring. Nevertheless, as a guideline, it is recommended that individuals do not exercise if symptoms are 'below the neck' (e.g. fever, diarrhoea, chesty cough, aching joints and muscles, swollen lymph glands). However, if the symptoms are above the neck (e.g. runny nose, sneezing) then exercise at low to moderate intensities may be performed (Weidner et al 1998) .

It has been suggested that the apparent relationship between moderate exercise and incidence of infection may be related to an increase in 'immunosurveillance', that is, an increase in the ability of the host to respond to an infectious challenge (Nieman 2000) . However, evidence in support of this has not been so forthcoming; rather, it appears that acute and regular moderate exercise generally has little effect on the immune system. Nevertheless, in the study of 36 mildly obese women discussed above, brisk walking for 45 minutes, five times a week over a 15-week period was associated with a 57% increase in natural killer cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) after 6 weeks of the study compared with an increase of just 3% in the control group (Nieman et al 1990b) . NK cells are a type of lymphocyte (further details about NK cells can be found in Ch. 2) and unlike the other lymphocyte sub-populations T and B cells, NK cells are able to destroy a variety of virus-infected cells spontaneously. NK cells form an important first line of defence against viral infection, and as such, the greater NKCA, or killing ability, found after 6 weeks of moderate exercise training could account for the fewer URTI symptom days experienced by the exercising group. However, this elevation of NKCA was not observed at the end of the 15 weeks of training; this was suggested by the authors to be perhaps due to seasonal variations in this measure of immune function. Elevated NKCA was also not found after 5 or 12 weeks of a brisk walking training programme in elderly women compared with their peers who participated in callisthenics training (Nieman et al 1993) . This was despite observing a lower incidence of URTI in the walkers during this time, as discussed above. It was suggested that any training-induced adaptation in NK defence mechanisms may require longer to develop in elderly individuals because baseline comparison of the sedentary women with a group of highly conditioned elderly women revealed that NKCA was 54% higher in the highly conditioned women. As you may remember, these women also had the lowest incidence of URTI among the three groups. It has also been suggested that immunoglobulin-A (IgA) may play a role in the apparent altered susceptibility to URTI associated with moderate exercise. IgA is the principal immunoglobulin (or antibody) in mucosal secretions (e.g. tears, saliva); therefore, IgA is an important defence mechanism against pathogens trying to enter through the oral mucosa (see Chapter 2 for further details about the structure and function of immunoglobulins). A 12-week exercise training programme (three aerobic training sessions per week, each lasting 30 minutes at 70% heart rate reserve) was associated with a 57% increase in salivary-IgA (s-IgA) concentration compared with baseline in nine previously sedentary men and women (Klentrou et al 2002) . A non-significant decrease in s-IgA concentration was observed at the same time point in a group of sedentary controls. URTI symptoms were recorded in daily logbooks, using codes similar to those described previously. In addition, subjects were asked to code their symptoms as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Although it is possible that the perception of severity of symptoms may differ between individuals and hence may undermine the reliability of these data, there were fewer 'severe' URTI symptom days in the exercising group compared with the controls during the study. A significant negative relationship was found between s-IgA levels and total sickness days (r = −0.64, P<0.05) (i.e. higher s-IgA levels were associated with fewer days with sickness). However, a significant relationship between s-IgA concentration and days reporting only cold symptoms was not found, with the authors suggesting that this was due to some ambiguity in the description of the cold-related symptoms. Given the small number of subjects in the study, it might be that a larger-scale study is needed to confirm these findings. However, a significant negative relationship between s-IgA concentration and incidence of URTI (as assessed by a physician) has been reported in a group of moderately trained subjects (Gleeson et al 1999) . These subjects were involved in regular exercise programmes for up to 4 hours per week over a 7-month period, and formed the control group for a group of elite swimmers; a similar relationship between s-IgA and incidence of infection was also found for these athletes.

Although the findings outlined above may suggest that alterations in s-IgA and NKCA contribute to the apparent lower susceptibility to infection associated with regular performance of moderate exercise, there is not sufficient convincing evidence at present to support the theory that immunosurveillance is improved with regular moderate exercise.

The J-shaped model suggests that taking part in some regular moderate physical activity decreases the relative risk of URTI to below that of a sedentary individual. Although this area has not been extensively researched, this hypothesis is generally supported by the findings of a number of epidemiological studies. However, evidence to support the hypothesis of improved immunosurveillance with regular moderate exercise is not so forthcoming, although there is some limited evidence to suggest that enhanced NKCA and s-IgA concentrations may play key roles. The influence of other factors such as psychological wellbeing, nutritional status and subject lifestyle should also be considered when exploring potential reasons for this apparent relationship between regular moderate exercise and lowered risk for URTI.

Recall from the J-shaped model that an acute bout of prolonged, intense exercise or a prolonged period of heavy exercise training is associated with a risk of URTI that is above that of a sedentary individual. The majority of studies that have explored the validity of this portion of the J-shaped model have looked at responses from athletes involved in endurance-type events. That is not to say that athletes involved in resistance or sprint events are less likely to report symptoms of URTI; if training heavily with insufficient recovery periods between sessions it would appear that these athletes are at as much risk of URTI as those who perform endurance sports.

For the past 50 years or so, there have been an increasing number of reports from both athletes and their coaches to suggest that athletes involved in heavy schedules of training and competition suffer from a higher incidence of infection, particularly URTI, compared with their sedentary counterparts. Furthermore, there is a feeling that it takes longer for these athletes to recover from illness. For example, after setting the 5000 m World Record in 1982, David Moorcroft spoke of 'those familiar coughs and colds' (Evans 1996) . The marathon runner Alberto Salazar reported that he caught 12 colds in 12 months while training for the 1984 Olympic marathon and recalled that 'I caught everything. I felt like I should have been living in a bubble' (Nieman 1998) . A number of epidemiological studies have now been conducted to try and establish whether or not there is any truth in the perception among athletes and coaches that heavy training can lead to a decreased resistance to illness.

Compared with the effects of moderate exercise on susceptibility to URTI, there has been a little more research conducted in the area of heavy exercise and risk of URTI. As with moderate exercise, these studies have been survey-based epidemiological studies, with self-reporting of symptoms of URTI, rather than a confirmed clinical diagnosis. As mentioned earlier, these studies have the advantage of allowing large numbers of athletes to be studied. On the other hand it should be acknowledged that the self-reporting of URTI by athletes may be influenced by a degree of positive response bias in the data: it could be argued that those athletes who respond to these questionnaires are more likely to be those who have symptoms of URTI (i.e. a positive response). Furthermore, it could be argued that highly trained athletes are

also more 'body-aware' and hence may report symptoms that less active individuals may not take any notice of.

The findings of two key studies looking at incidence of URTI following marathontype events suggest that participating in competitive endurance events is associated with an increased risk of URTI during the 7-14 days following the event (Nieman et al 1990a , Peters & Bateman 1983 . In a randomly selected sample of 140 runners in the 1982 Two Oceans Marathon (a distance of 56 km) in Cape Town, 33% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI in the 2-week period following the race, compared with 15% of a group of age-matched non-running controls, each of whom lived in the same household as one of the runners (Peters & Bateman 1983) . Further examination of the data revealed a significant negative relationship between racetime and post-race illness with symptoms of URTI far more prevalent in those runners who completed the race in less than 4 hours, suggesting a relationship between acute exercise stress and susceptibility to URTI (Fig. 1.4) . Similar findings were reported from a cohort of over 2000 runners who took part in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon (Nieman et al 1990a) . During the week after the marathon, 13% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI compared with only 2% of a group of similarly experienced runners who did not compete for reasons other than illness. In addition, 40% of the runners experienced at least one episode of URTI during the 2 months prior to the marathon itself. After controlling for confounding factors such as age, perceived stress levels and illness in the home, it was found that those who ran more than 96 km (60 miles) per week in training were twice as likely to suffer illness compared with those who trained less than 32 km (20 miles) per week.

Although many of the investigations of the relationship between heavy exercise and immune function have concentrated on competitive marathon races, there are now several published reports detailing a relationship between heavy volumes of training and competition and incidence of URTI in athletes involved in other sports, including swimming (Gleeson et al 1999) , orienteering (Linde 1987) and football (Bury et al 1998) . For example, over a 1-year period, 22 episodes of URTI (as diagnosed by a physician) were observed in a group of professional European footballers compared with only nine episodes in a group of untrained controls. There was also a tendency for the URTI symptoms to last longer in the footballers compared with the controls. In another study, Foster (1998) reported that the majority of illnesses experienced by a group of competitive speed skaters occurred when the athletes exceeded individually identifiable training thresholds, with almost 90% of these illnesses occurring within 10 days of a peak in training strain, although it should be noted that these illnesses were not explicitly recorded as episodes of URTI.

Taken together, these studies suggest that performing both acute bouts of intense, prolonged exercise and higher volumes of training are associated with an increased susceptibility to URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, it is important to keep this in perspective: the findings of these studies suggest that the relative risk of an episode of URTI is increased following heavy exercise but the majority of athletes do not experience an episode of URTI after prolonged strenuous activity. For example, in the cohort of over 2000 marathon runners who completed the 1987 Los Angeles marathon, only one in every seven marathon runners reported symptoms of URTI in the week following the event (Nieman et al 1990a) . In addition, exercise duration may be a critical factor in determining post-race susceptibility for URTI because performing 5 km, 10 km and 21.1 km events was associated with the same incidence of URTI in the week after the race as that reported in the week before (Nieman et al 1989) . Other factors that may influence these findings should also not be overlooked. The Los Angeles marathon is held in March and reported episodes of URTI are lower in the summer than in the winter months (Nieman 2000) . In support of this, 77% of the URTI diagnosed in professional footballers occurred during the winter months (Bury et al 1998) , although equally it could be argued that it is during this period that the footballers would have been training and competing most heavily. As well as ambient conditions, other environmental factors may also contribute to the finding of increased episodes of URTI following marathon events in large cities such as Cape Town and Los Angeles. Exposure to elevated levels of ozone during exercise has been associated with increased mortality in mice exposed to Streptococcus pyogenes, while exposure to elevated levels of sulphur dioxide increased leukocyte counts in the lungs of males following 20 minutes of light-intensity cycling (Illing et al 1980 , Sandström et al 1989 . In addition, inhalation of air pollutants could cause the symptoms of a sore throat in the absence of any infection. Other possible reasons for the increased incidence of URTI reported in athletes include poor dietary practices, increased exposure to pathogens (through sharing drinking bottles and spending time in close proximity to others -for example at training camps) and elevated psychological stress (Shephard & Shek 1999) . These issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.

Putting aside the potential influences outlined above, it is now well established that performing acute bouts of high intensity exercise is associated with a depression of immune function that may last up to 72 hours (Nieman 2000) and it seems logical to assume that this may be related to the apparent increased incidence of URTI experienced by athletes who are training and competing heavily. The decline in host defence mechanisms after exercise has been termed an 'open window' during which viruses and bacteria may gain entry into the body, thus increasing the risk of infection (Nieman 2000) . In theory, a chronic depression of immune function could arise over a period of time during which strenuous exercise is performed without sufficient time for recovery of immune cell function. However, although there is a great deal of evidence for a decrease in the ability of isolated immune cells to respond to a challenge following strenuous exercise (as discussed in Chs 4 and 5), a direct link between impaired immune function in vivo and subsequent infection has not yet been established. One of the reasons for this is the serious ethical issues involved in inoculating subjects with a known cold-causing virus and asking them to participate in heavy exercise. One major concern here is the potential risk of viral myocarditis (a viral infection of the heart muscle); exercising during a viral infection may increase the likelihood of developing this potentially fatal condition.

One study has attempted to shed some light on whether an impairment of the whole body's ability to respond to a pathogen following severe exercise could be associated with an increased risk of acute infection (Bruunsgaard et al 1997) . In this study, several antigens (foreign proteins that induce an antibody response) were injected into the skin on the forearms of trained triathletes following a half-ironman event. This action should stimulate an immune response to each of the antigens, known as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a raised red swelling of the skin at the site where the antigen was applied. After 48 hours, an investigator recorded the diameter of the resulting swelling, giving a positive reading if the mean diameter was 2 mm or more. The implication is that the larger the area of the swelling the stronger the immune response to that antigen. The skin test responses of the triathletes were compared with those of a group of triathletes who did not take part in the event in addition to a group of moderately trained controls. The lowest cumulative responses to the skin tests (i.e. lowest number of positive readings and sum of the diameters of the swellings) were found in the exercised triathletes ( Fig. 1.5 The cumulative skin test score (number of positive responses and sum of the diameters of the raised swellings) in a group of triathletes following a triathlon race (group A), a group of triathletes who did not compete in the race (group B) and a group of moderately trained individuals (group C). The response of group A was significantly lower than that of groups B and C. (Data from Bruunsgaard et al 1997.) suggesting an impaired whole body ability to respond to an infectious challenge following intense exercise and an increased risk of developing subsequent infection.

The J-shaped model suggests that participating in acute bouts of intense exercise and involvement in heavy schedules of training and competition increases the relative risk of URTI to above that of a sedentary individual. Research into this area has generally concentrated on survey-based studies of large cohorts of competitive endurance-trained athletes and the findings do provide support for a relationship between heavy exercise and increased risk for URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, whether or not this increase in susceptibility for infection is associated with the documented impairment of immune function observed following prolonged, intense exercise is still not wholly proven. A number of other factors may also contribute to the higher number of infections experienced by athletes, including environmental factors, increased exposure to pathogens, poor nutritional practices and increased psychological stress.

Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Study design: All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results: Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion: SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.","Since November 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected 8437 persons and has caused more than 800 deaths worldwide. 1 SARS is a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus 2,3 that causes atypical pneumonia, which may progress to respiratory failure. 4 It appeared that the SARS outbreak was currently under controlled, though the problem may re-emerge during the winter. There is no published information on the outcomes of pregnant women infected with SARS. Given the significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality of most viral pneumonia in pregnancy, SARS may impose greater risk in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. We reported the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all pregnant women affected during the outbreak in Hong Kong.

Between February 1 and July 31, 2003, all pregnant women in Hong Kong whose disease met the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition of May 1, 2003 , of SARS were included. 5 These patients were jointly managed by the infectious disease specialists, intensive care physicians, respiratory physicians, obstetricians, and midwives. The (medical) clinical course and demographic data were abstracted from the records.

Pregnancies in the first trimester were identified by pregnancy tests offered to all female SARS patients suspected to be pregnant. Ultrasound examination was performed as soon after admission as practical. All pregnant women at more than 24 weeks of gestation, once classified as probable cases of SARS, were transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital, which is a designated hospital for infection control in Hong Kong, for further management. Medical treatment was offered to the patients while maternal and fetal conditions were closely monitored. Indications for early delivery included maternal deterioration, failure to maintain adequate oxygenation or difficulty with mechanical ventilation because of the gravid uterus, fetal compromise or other obstetric indications. Daily cardiotocography (CTG) was performed for pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation. Fetal growth was assessed by serial ultrasound scans every 2 weeks. Liquor volume measurement and umbilical Doppler artery blood flow studies were performed on a weekly basis.

The obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected. Major medical complications were identified. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed by the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV RT-PCR) and viral culture on cord blood, placenta tissue, and amniotic fluid at or after delivery as appropriate. Maternal blood was removed before the cord blood was collected with a sterile syringe. A 1-cm cubic of fresh placenta tissue was removed after it had been thoroughly rinsed with sterile saline solution and dissected from the chorionic plate. The remaining placenta tissue was sent for histopathology and/or electron microscopy, particularly searching for viral inclusion bodies or particles. The newborn infants were followed-up with SARS-CoV antibody titers for evidence of SARS infection.

The samples collected were sent to the Public Health Laboratory, Government Virology Unit of Hong Kong for qualitative SARS-CoV PCR testing. The technique was described in a recent Center for Disease Control publication. 6 For SARS-CoV antibody titer, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay test was used, a test detecting a mixture of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulinG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients yields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of illness. 7

During the study period, there were a total of 12 Southern Chinese patients with SARS admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong (Table I) . The maternal age ranged between 27 to 44 years. There were 5 health care workers and 7 others who acquired the disease in the community. Seven women were less than 13 weeks of gestation (3-12 weeks) and the other 5 patients were in their late second and third trimesters at presentation. None of the patients had underlying medical disease.

All patients had high fevers (O38(C) and most presented with chill, rigors, malaise, and myalgia. Only 33% of the pregnant patients presented with shortness of breath. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles with or without percussion dullness. Lymphopenia (!1.0!10 9 /L) was observed in 8 patients at presentation, but subsequently all had lymphopenia develop. Some patients had mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (5/12) and aminotransferase (4/12) levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease in all patients, similar to those reported earlier in nonpregnant patients. 6 There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. Viral serology for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. All patients had either positive SARS-CoV RT-PCRs or raised SARS-CoV antibody titers (O100). Patient 7 was retrospectively diagnosed to have SARS. She is a health care worker and had cared for a patient with atypical pneumonia from Guangdong Province, China, before the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. She subsequently had a high fever and atypical pneumonia develop 5 days later.

All patients were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, namely, beta-lactams and macrolides or fluoro-quinolones.

All patients, except patient 7, were given ribavirin and/ or hydrocortisone after 48 hours of observation. All couples were fully informed of the potential teratogenic effect of ribavirin and all opted to receive this treatment. Ten patients also had 1 or more courses of pulse methyl-prednisolone as described in previous publications. 8 The fever lasted between 2 and 9 days. Five patients had high fevers develop again after initial response. Six patients (50%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of decreased blood oxygen saturation. The length of stay ranged from 14 to 37 days. Four patients (33%) required mechanical ventilation ranging from 16 to 37 days. After ribavirin therapy all patients became anemic (Hb !10g/dL).

The major medical complications among these patients included disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (patients 3, 8, and 12), renal failure (patients 3, 9, and 12), secondary bacterial pneumonia (patients 3 and 12), sepsis (patients 11 and 12), adult respiratory distress syndrome (patients 3, 10, 11, and 12), cardiovascular collapse (patient 11), abdominal wound dehiscence (patients 11 and 12), and surgical emphysema (patient 12). Three deaths occurred of which 2 patients (patients 3 and 11) died of progressive respiratory failure and 1 patient (patient 12) died of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia associated with cardiovascular collapse not responsive to active resuscitation.

Six of the 7 women (except patient 7) presenting in the first trimester had positive pregnancy tests during hospital admission. Five women (patients 2-6) had ultrasound confirmation of an intrauterine gestational sac. In these, absence of fetal pole was noted in 3 women (patients 2, 3, and 4) and a single fetal pole with fetal heart pulsation was detected in 2 (patients 5 and 6). Ultrasound failed to demonstrate an intrauterine sac in 1 woman (patient 1) and she did not have any sign or symptom of ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous miscarriage. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotrophins rapidly decreased and she was considered to have a very early pregnancy loss. Myalgia 

NA, Not applicable; SOB, shortness of breath; CXR, chest X-ray; CT, computed tomograph; IV, intravenous.

Four of the 7 patients presented in first trimester had spontaneous miscarriages between 2 to 5 weeks after the onset of illness (Table II) . Patient 7 did not receive ribavirin or steroid and has an uncomplicated ongoing pregnancy. Patients 5 and 6 had termination of pregnancies at 10 weeks and 15 weeks of gestation for social reasons after they had recovered from SARS. Gestation at presentation for the other 5 patients ranged from 26 to 32 weeks. Four pregnancies (80%) resulted in preterm delivery. Three patients were delivered by emergency cesarean section between 26 and 32 weeks of gestation because of maternal deterioration, secondary to failure to maintain adequate blood oxygen saturation, despite on 100% oxygen (patients 10 to 12). Patient 10 also had fetal distress develop before cesarean section. After delivery, the need for supplemental oxygen was reduced in all mothers. One patient was extubated 20 hours after delivery, but she was reintubated 32 hours later for oxygen desaturation again. The ventilator settings for the other 2 patients were unchanged after delivery.

Two pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) that did not require early intervention had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) develop during treatment. Both pregnancies were also complicated by oligohydramnios. Fetal surveillance with antenatal CTG and umbilical arterial Doppler velocimetry was satisfactory. Patient 8 had spontaneous preterm labor at 33 weeks of gestation during the convalescence period, which did not respond to tocolysis. Patient 9 had emergency lower-segment cesarean section for intrapartum nonreassuring CTG.

There was no clinical or serologic evidence suggestive of vertical transmission of the coronavirus (Table III) . To date, none of the 5 newborn infants show any evidence of perinatal SARS infection. In particular, the first 3 newborn infants (newborn infants 3-5) were delivered during the acute stage of maternal SARS infection and were exposed to a significant risk of perinatal infection. Peritoneal fluid (patient 10) and samples of body fluid were positive for SARS-CoV at the time of cesarean section. The SARS-CoV RT-PCRs and viral cultures from nasal swab, blood, urine, and stool were all negative in these infants. There was also no significant rise in paired acute and convalescent SARS-CoV antibody titers.

Three newborn infants delivered soon after the mothers presented with SARS were average in size, whereas the other 2 were growth restricted with birth weight below the fifth percentile for gestation. Of the newborn infants delivered preterm, 2 had serious complications develop related to prematurity (Table III) .

RT-PCRs and viral cultures of the cord blood and placenta tissues were all negative for SARS-CoV. Amniotic fluid obtained from patients 5, 6, and 9 were also negative for SARS-CoV. No viral inclusion body or particle was detected in the products of conceptions. The placental findings from the 5 deliveries are summarized in Table III . All the placentae showed trimmed weight falling short of the fifth percentile for gestation, with a weight deficiency of 8% to 47%. Three placentae (patients 10 to 12) had normal histopathologic findings. Two placentae from pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) complicated by IUGR showed avascular fibrotic terminal villi with thrombotic vasculopathy in some stem villi. In addition, placental infarction was evident grossly and on histology in the placenta of patient 9. The percentage of infarcted placental tissue was estimated to be about 10%. No placentae showed chorioamnionitis, funisitis, villitis, viral inclusion, or other features of infection. No significant erythroblastosis was noted.

The risk of viral pneumonia is significantly higher among pregnant women compared with the general population, especially when there is no effective antiviral therapy. 9 The influenza epidemic of 1918 and Asian flu epidemic of 1957 had a maternal mortality rate of 30% to 50%. 10,11 SARS has the same impact, and pregnant women appear to have a worse clinical course with a case fatality rate of 25%. In the current series, more patients required ICU admissions (50%) and mechanical ventilation (33%) compared with the nonpregnant adult population (20% ICU admission). 8 This poor outcome could be ascribed to the physiologic changes in pulmonary function during late pregnancy. The gravid uterus has been shown to elevate the diaphragm by up to 4 cm in the third trimester, while oxygen consumption is increased by 20% in pregnancy and functional residual capacity is decreased, rendering the woman intolerant to hypoxia. 12 Fifty-seven percent of our patients had spontaneous miscarriage, which was higher than the 15% to 20% widely reported early pregnancy loss rate. 13 The increased miscarriage risk was unlikely to be due to transplacental infection, as there was an absence of viral particles in the products of conceptions. Severe maternal respiratory failure and hypoxemia may disrupt uterine placental flow and cause miscarriage. Ribavirin is a commonly used first-line medication for the management of SARS in Hong Kong. Six patients had ribavirin, and a significant embryocidal effect has been observed in rabbits and mice, it may be possible that during this anembryonic stage ribavarin was the cause of spontaneous miscarriage. 14, 15 There are no human data for early pregnancy use and such postulation needs further confirmation. Ribavirin was also associated with significant teratogenic effects in animal studies. 14, 16 Patients who decide to use ribavirin in early pregnancy should be given the option for termination of pregnancy.

In maternal pneumonia, neonatal morbidity frequently arises as a result of preterm labor (15%-44%). 17, 18 Eighty percent of our cohort who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm and therefore were associated with higher neonatal morbidity. Other fetal/neonatal complications include IUGR, intrauterine demise, and neonatal death. 17 ,18 IUGR appears to be a common sequel among our patients who carried on with their pregnancies. This might be due to the severe maternal respiratory illness affecting the oxygen supply to the fetuses. These patients had frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation, often falling below 90%. The situation resembles that of those living at high altitudes, causing a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen 19, 20 and consequent IUGR. The general impact of a severe maternal debilitating illness on fetal growth also needs to be considered. The placental findings of placental infarction (patient 9) indicate maternal thrombosis, and the avascular villi (patients 8 and 9) suggest fetal thrombosis. There was also significant placental weight reduction relating to the duration of SARS before delivery (Table III) . Again, these changes were likely to represent complications of the hypoxemia and circulatory insufficiency in both the mother and fetus as a result of SARS. The observed fetal growth restriction is unlikely to be due to hydrocortisone or methyl-prednisolone, as neither steroid crosses the placenta readily. The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV was low, as there was no evidence of the presence of virus/viral particles in the products of conception or the infants. Direct contact with maternal body fluid that contained SARS-CoV put the infants at high risk of perinatal infection. Preventive measures at delivery, such as performing nasopharyngeal suction before first breath and cleansing the infant soon after birth, might help to reduce the viral load. It was a fortunate finding from our cohort that there was no evidence of vertical transmission, despite close contact with SARS virus. Indeed, there should be a theoretical advantage of delaying delivery in these patients to avoid the exposure of these infants to the virus at birth. The passage of maternal SARS-CoV antibodies across the placenta to the fetal circulation should have additional protective effect on the fetus/neonate. Nevertheless, it was our experience that the timing of delivery was frequently dictated by the deteriorating maternal condition.

This observational study consisted of only 12 pregnant women and the number of patients involved is small. We caution the readers to take this into account when interpreting the results and conclusion drawn from the study, as some of the above observations may be due to chance occurrence. As there is currently no large series on pregnant women with SARS, we believed such information is useful in guiding us in our future management of such women.

In conclusion, our experience showed that SARS during pregnancy is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. There were high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and IUGR. There appeared to be a low risk of clinical SARS among infants of SARS patients, even when the delivery occurred during acute maternal infection. The adverse pregnancy outcomes might be due to the effects of SARS infection on pregnancy as well as to the medical treatment received for SARS.

Severe Morbidity and Mortality Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Versus Influenza Infection in Hospitalized Older Adults,Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of serious respiratory illness in older adults. Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) initially was found to be a common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children [1, 2] . While mild disease in healthy young adults has also been described [3] , the potential for RSV to cause severe disease in adults was not recognized until reports of outbreaks among older adults residing in long-term care facilities emerged [4, 5] . Subsequently, RSV was shown to cause serious illness among healthy, community-dwelling older adults. A landmark study of high-risk and community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years and high-risk adults in the United States detected RSV infection in 3%-7% of healthy, community-dwelling older adults, 4%-10% of high-risk adults, and 16% of adults hospitalized with cardiopulmonary infections [6] . Furthermore, RSV infection was estimated to result in approximately 177 000 hospitalizations, 10 000 to 14 000 deaths, and more than $1 billion dollars in healthcare costs per year in the United States, mostly among older adults [6, 7] . Nonetheless, RSV remains clinically underrecognized by most healthcare providers as a cause of severe respiratory disease in adults [7] [8] [9] .

A current comparison of the clinical characteristics and burden of RSV illness with those of influenza, a well-recognized cause of severe morbidity and mortality in older adults [10] , may increase provider awareness of the potential of RSV infection to cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in older adults. Appreciation of the potential for RSV infection to cause serious illness similar to that caused by influenza will likely trigger more testing for RSV in addition to testing for influenza and direct therapy to the identified etiology in patients as newer agents become available. In addition, recent data on the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of older adults hospitalized with RSV are critical to the evaluation of more than 50 RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals currently under development prior to their introduction [11] . While a number of important studies have described the burden and clinical characteristics of RSV and influenza disease in hospitalized older adults, most of these studies were conducted at least a decade ago [6, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, longterm mortality has not been analyzed previously. Therefore, we evaluated a large cohort of adults aged ≥60 years hospitalized with RSV or influenza A/B infection during 5 consecutive seasons. Demographics, prehospitalization characteristics, hospital utilization, and clinical outcomes, including long-term mortality, were assessed and compared between adults with RSV infection and those with influenza virus infection.

This observational, retrospective, cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated healthcare system that provides comprehensive prepaid health services for 4.4 million members cared for at 15 large, community-based hospitals that are owned and operated by KPSC. The demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely mirrors the racially and sociodemographically diverse Southern California population and the California census population; more than 99% are community dwelling [16] . As KPSC is a prepaid healthcare system, there is a very strong motivation for members to use services internally. Furthermore, reimbursement by KPSC for outside care requires that claims be submitted with documentation of the care provided; claims are subsequently entered into the administrative data systems. Thus, capture of care delivered to KPSC members by electronic data is very comprehensive.

The study population consisted of hospitalized KPSC members aged ≥60 years at the time of admission who had a positive RSV or influenza A/B laboratory test (multiplex polymerase chain reaction [PCR] [FilmArray, Luminex xTAG], influenza A/B/ H1N1 [Cepheid Xpert Flu], or viral culture) that was ordered between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 during a hospitalization encounter or an emergency department encounter that resulted in hospitalization at 1 of 15 KPSC hospitals. All samples were submitted to a single, centralized KPSC laboratory for processing. Participants were required to have continuous KPSC membership for at least 6 months (allowing a 31-day gap) prior to the hospital admission date to allow for ascertainment of baseline characteristics. If there were patients with multiple hospitalizations who met the above criteria (eg, had a positive RSV or influenza A/B test on 2 separate hospitalization encounters), the first RSV or first influenza hospitalization was kept for the RSV or influenza cohort, respectively. For the purpose of statistical comparison, independent samples of RSV and influenza cohorts were defined. Twenty-five individuals with both a positive RSV test and a positive influenza test during different hospitalizations during the study period were kept in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort. Nineteen individuals coinfected with RSV and influenza during the same hospitalization were excluded from the comparison. The KPSC Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.

Electronic medical records were used to obtain information for the study population, including membership history, baseline characteristics, demographics, comorbidities, treatments, utilization, and outcomes. Each KPSC health plan member has a unique medical record number that is used as an identifier to retrieve and link all variables from different databases.

Outcomes of hospitalization included length of stay, occurrence of complications, use of respiratory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission, use of vasopressors, mortality, exacerbation of chronic conditions, discharge location, and healthcare utilization after discharge.

Patient demographics, prehospital course, comorbid conditions, and in-hospital utilization were compared between patients hospitalized with RSV and those hospitalized with influenza A/B using a χ 2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, or Wilcoxon ranksum test, as appropriate. Categorical factors were presented using frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were categorized based on distribution and described using mean, standard deviation, and range, in addition to frequencies and percentages.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with hospitalization outcomes between those infected with RSV and those infected with influenza after adjustment for potential differences between cohorts, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/chronic bronchitis/emphysema, Charlson comorbidity index [17] , history of healthcare utilization, and recent use of antivirals, antibiotics, or steroids. One-year survival after admission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival rates between hospitalized persons infected with RSV or influenza were compared using the log-rank test. The analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Among patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) during the study period, RSV infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 91.8% and by culture in 8.2% of patients. Among patients hospitalized with influenza (n = 1878) during the study period, influenza infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 82.6%, by influenza A/B/H1N1 PCR in 0.05%, and by culture in 17.4% of patients. The distribution of demographic characteristics, medical history, and comorbidities of patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) or with influenza (n = 1878) is presented in Table 1 . Patients hospitalized with RSV infection were slightly older (mean age, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035), with a higher proportion of those aged ≥85 years compared to those hospitalized with influenza infection. There was a higher proportion of females in the RSV cohort than in the influenza cohort (60.5% vs 50.3% female; P < .001). Race/ethnicity distributions were similar between the RSV and the influenza cohorts. A higher proportion of RSV patients than influenza patients had received influenza vaccine in the 1 year prior to admission (83.1% vs 73.1%; P < .001). Smoking status and body mass index were similar between cohorts. The prevalence of several comorbidities was significantly different between patients hospitalized with RSV and those with influenza, including congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P < .001), diabetes (38.9% vs 44.6%; P = .012), COPD/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006), asthma (26.0% vs 18.6%; P < .001), any solid cancer (11.2% vs 8.0%; P = .016), and leukemia (1.9% vs 0.9%; P = .050). Use of any antiviral therapy, including oseltamivir, within 14 days prior to admission was not common but was more prevalent in the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort (4.3% vs 2.7%; P = .034 for any antiviral medication and 2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .026 for oseltamivir; data not shown).

The in-hospital characteristics of the RSV and influenza cohorts are described in Table 2 . The mean time from admission to the first positive test result for either RSV or influenza was similar between the 2 cohorts (2.5 vs 2.6 days; P = .570), and approximately 98% of patients in either cohort did not have test results available until some time after the hospital admission date. Among the RSV and influenza cohorts, respectively, use of antivirals (47.1% vs 78.6%; P < .001), 99% of which was oseltamivir (data not shown); antibiotics (94.1% vs 88.9%; P < .001); and any inhalation, injection, intravenous, or oral steroid (64.5% vs 47.9%; P < .001) during the hospitalization period was significantly different.

In the adjusted analyses, the odds of all outcomes were similar or significantly higher among participants hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza ( Figure 1 ). Hospital utilization was greater among those infected with RSV than with influenza as measured by length of stay ≥7 days among the entire population (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7), length of stay ≥7 days among survivors (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), and ICU admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7). In addition, respiratory complications during hospitalization were more common among RSV-infected older adults including pneumonia diagnosis (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2-3.2); highest measured respiratory rate (RR; measured by breaths per minute; RR ≥26 vs ≤22 reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9]); lowest oxygen saturation (≤84% vs ≥93% reference group [OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1]); greatest level of oxygen supplementation (≥16 L/min vs ≤5 L/min reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2]); exacerbation of COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4); and exacerbation of asthma (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). More older adults infected with RSV than with influenza required home health service after discharge (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). While mortality during hospitalization (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) and within 6 months of admission (OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5) for patients with RSV did not differ significantly from those with influenza, long-term mortality within 1 year of admission was significantly greater in the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort (OR = 1.3, 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). The 1-year survival rate after admission was significantly lower (Figure 2 , 74.2% vs 81.2%; P < .001) in older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza.

This retrospective cohort study that spans 5 consecutive winters demonstrates that RSV is an important cause of serious and life-threatening respiratory illness that results in morbidity and mortality among older adults that were comparable or more severe than those caused by influenza. To our knowledge, this study describes the largest and most recent cohort of older adults hospitalized with RSV or influenza reported to date. By utilizing patient electronic health records, we were able to obtain important information, including demographics and comorbidities prior to hospitalization and short-and long-term healthcare utilization and hospitalization outcomes.

Consistent with earlier reports, we found that adults hospitalized with RSV were slightly older and had greater frequency of baseline comorbidities, particularly cardiopulmonary disease, than those hospitalized with influenza virus infection [6, 12, 14] . However, after adjustment for comorbidities, we found that hospitalization outcomes among older adults hospitalized with RSV were either comparable to or significantly worse than they were among those hospitalized with influenza. While previous studies found similar hospital length of stay among older adults hospitalized with RSV or with influenza [6, 14] , we found that longer hospitalizations (length of stay ≥7 days) occurred more often among the RSV cohort than they did in the influenza cohort. This may reflect increased use of antiviral therapies in recent years that ameliorate influenza but not RSV disease [18] or differences in clinical recovery associated with a more pronounced RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract syndrome. We also found that pulmonary complications and findings, including pneumonia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and greater need for oxygen supplementation, and exacerbation of asthma and of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema were significantly greater among the RSV cohort after adjustment for potential confounders. These findings are similar to those of Lee et al. who reported that hospitalized adults with RSV in Hong Kong had a greater frequency of lower respiratory complications than those with influenza [14] . While increased baseline cardiopulmonary disease in the RSV cohort likely increased their risk of pulmonary complications, including exacerbation of chronic respiratory disease and asthma, these differences were observed after adjustment for comorbidities, including baseline cardiopulmonary disease. Discharge to hospice and skilled nursing facilities was similar in the RSV and influenza cohorts, but a greater proportion of the RSV cohort required home health services after discharge. Finally, similar to previous findings [6, 14] , short-term mortality for patients infected with RSV was similar to that of patients infected with influenza. However, longer-term survival among the RSV cohort, which has not been reported previously, was significantly worse than that of the influenza cohort. The impact of RSV on long-term survival may be a reflection of the potential for RSV to drive chronic inflammation associated with persistent, sometimes progressive, pulmonary disease, although the mechanism for this is not clear [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition to confirming the severe impact of annual influenza epidemics, our findings also underscore the substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization associated with RSV infection in the expanding population of older adults and the need for RSV vaccines and antivirals. Interestingly, influenza vaccine uptake within 1 year of admission was higher among the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort while receipt of pneumococcal vaccine was similar. This may reflect, in part, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza infections and is unlikely due to differential vaccine acceptance. On the other hand, the increased use of oseltamivir within 14 days prior to hospitalization among older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza may reflect presumed influenza infection and delay in diagnosis of RSV infection. Conversely, decreased in-hospital use of antiviral therapy among the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort likely reflects the discontinuation of oseltamivir after identification of RSV and initiation of oseltamivir after identification of influenza. The greater use of antibiotics and systemic and inhaled steroids in the RSV cohort during their hospitalizations may mirror the higher frequency of pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic lung disease and asthma among older hospitalized adults with RSV infection than those with influenza infection.

Whereas RSV has long been recognized as a cause of serious illness among young children, its role as a significant pathogen among older adult patients appears to be underrecognized by many adult providers [7] [8] [9] . This is understandable since in many settings, respiratory pathogen testing is limited to influenza virus testing, so that noninfluenza pathogens, including RSV, have not been recognized as possible etiologies of serious respiratory illness similar to that caused by influenza. In addition, even in settings in which multiplex pathogen testing is used, local circulation of influenza virus in the community and clinical suspicion for influenza may drive testing patterns among hospitalized older adults and, thus, may underestimate the relative frequency of other viral respiratory pathogens, including RSV, which may have either nonoverlapping or broader periods of circulation in the same community. Therefore, the number of hospitalizations with RSV or with influenza detected in this study may not reflect the relative incidences of each pathogen over the study period since RSV infections that occur during intervals when influenza virus is less prevalent are less likely to be detected.

Increased provider recognition of RSV as an important cause of severe influenza-like illness among older adults and other high-risk populations will become increasingly important in order to increase vaccine uptake among high-risk populations after RSV vaccines are developed. In addition, recognition and early identification of RSV as a potential cause of illness that is sometimes indistinguishable from influenza [23, 24] will be important in the timely implementation of diagnostic testing, adjustment of antiviral medication administration, including early discontinuation of medications targeted to influenza, and initiation of medications effective against RSV as they become available in order to optimize effectiveness and to minimize cost and complications.

The strengths of this study include detailed clinical and health outcomes data extracted from a large patient sample drawn from a racially and socioeconomically diverse population receiving care at multiple medical centers over 5 seasons. In addition, the widespread inpatient use of a sensitive multiplex PCR to detect RSV and influenza allowed for the possible detection of a wide spectrum of both diseases [6] . Moreover, since these test results were not immediately available, initial medical management decisions, including hospital admission and treatment decisions, were made based on severity of clinical symptoms rather than virologic diagnosis, minimizing bias resulting from differential admission or management plans for different infections.

RSV is a cause of serious illness among hospitalized older adults with morbidity and mortality that may be even more substantial than that caused by influenza, with possibly greater impact on long-term survival. The projected continued increase in the proportion of older adults in the population [25] underscores the growing unmet medical and public health need to develop vaccines and therapeutics directed against RSV. Increased appreciation among adult providers of the frequency and severity of RSV disease among adults will be important to the uptake of RSV vaccines and antivirals after they are introduced.

Clinical Presentation and Birth Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Pregnancy,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children worldwide [1] . RSV antibody protects young infants from severe ALRI. No RSV vaccines are currently licensed, though a RSV vaccine for use in pregnant women recently completed a phase II clinical trial in the United States [2, 3] . A RSV vaccine administered during pregnancy has the potential to protect the infant through transplacental antibody transfer and to decrease maternal RSV illness incidence and severity.

Maternal immunization against influenza, tetanus, and pertusiss has been shown to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in preventing disease in infants [2] . Influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [4] . Maternal influenza vaccination is associated with decreased risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as low birthweight or small-for-gestational age infants [5] [6] [7] . RSV infection is associated with a similar disease burden to influenza in high-risk and elderly adults, and may be associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy [8, 9] . The clinical presentation of RSV illness during pregnancy and the postpartum period and the effect of RSV infection on maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes are not well-described in large prospective studies.

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical presentation of respiratory syncytial virus infection using active home-based surveillance for respiratory illness in pregnant women in a prospective study.

Two consecutive randomized placebo-controlled trials of maternal influenza immunization were conducted in two annual cohorts in Sarlahi District of southern Nepal from April 2011 to May 2014 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01034254) [10] . Women were enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy and followed with weekly home-based visits until 180 days postpartum. Symptom information was captured by recall over the previous week at each visit. Maternal respiratory illness required reported or measured fever (>38°C) with at least one other symptom: cough, myalgia, sore throat or rhinorrhea. Infant respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficult or rapid breathing, or a draining ear. Participants who reported protocol-defined respiratory illness had mid-nasal swabs (NS) obtained by field workers during weekly visits. An RSV illness episode was defined as the presence of any symptoms occurring for a minimum of one day with a mid-nasal swab obtained and RSV detected on PCR assay, with a minimum of 7 symptom-free days separating illness episodes. Incidence of RSV was calculated using days of follow-up from enrollment until end of study or loss to follow-up.

Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected at enrollment and at weekly visits, and birthweight was measured at a postpartum home visit. Birthweight was included in the analysis if obtained within the first 72 hours after birth. Low birthweight was defined as weight < 2500 grams. Preterm birth was defined as birth at < 37 weeks completed gestation. Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to previously published methods [11] . Small-for-gestational age was defined according to the Alexander criteria [12] . A household was defined as the persons sharing a common cookstove. Household density was defined as the numbers of persons/room in the household. Statistical testing was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests to compare clinical and sociodemographic characteristics (SAS 9.3, Cary, NC).

Mid-nasal swabs were transported in a temperature-stable nucleic acid buffer (Primestore, Longhorn Diagnostics, Austin, TX) to the field laboratory, where they were aliquoted and stored at 4°Celsius until transport to the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory in Seattle, WA, U.S.A [13] . RSV testing was performed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [13] . Specimens with RSV detected were additionally tested for quantitative viral load and subtype [14] [15] [16] .

IRB approval for the study was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Seattle Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University, and the Nepal Health Research Council. Oral consent was obtained from study participants due to low literacy rates in the population. This procedure was approved by the IRB.

Altogether, 3693 pregnant women were enrolled and followed from April 2011 to May 2014; 944 nasal swabs were collected during 3554 person-years of follow-up while pregnant or postpartum, with a respiratory virus detected in 556 (59%) of these swabs. RSV was detected in nasal swabs collected from 14 (0.4%) of all women, which constitutes 2.0% of the 733 women with febrile respiratory illnesses (Fig 1) . RSV was detected in women only between September and December during the three years of the study. The incidence of RSV was 3.9/1000 person years overall. A total of 1189 person-years of follow-up occurred between September and December; during this period, the incidence of RSV was 11.8/1000 person-years.

Overall, the median gestational age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). For mothers who had RSV, the median age at enrollment was 16 weeks, (range, and for mothers without RSV, the median age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). Overall, 90% of moms were enrolled prior to 28 weeks gestation. Seven women had an RSV illness during pregnancy (median days before birth: 42 days, range, 13-201 days) and seven had RSV illness after delivery (median days after birth: 74, range 27-168). Baseline characteristics of women with and without RSV infection are shown in Table 1 . Mothers with RSV report fewer median years of education than those without (0 vs. 5 years; P = 0.04). No differences were observed in number of other children in the household (P = 0.80), use of an open indoor cookstove (P = 0.09), or presence of household members who smoked (P = 0.73).

RSV illness in pregnant and postpartum women was associated with a median of 2 days of fever (range, 1-7), 2 days of myalgia (range, 0-5), 1 day of cough (range, 0-5), 2 days of rhinorrhea (range, 0-18), and 0 days of sore throat (range, 0-10), with a median of 4 days of any symptoms (range, 2-18) ( Table 2 ; Fig 2) . Seven (50%) mothers sought care at local health care facilities for their RSV illness. Of these, two visited a medicine shop and five saw a practitioner. No mothers with RSV infection died.

The median RSV viral load was 4.1 log 10 copies/mL (range, 2.3-8.5). RSV subtype A was detected in 9 (75%) of 12 samples with subtyping performed. An additional respiratory virus was detected in five illness episodes, including coronavirus (n = 1; 20%), rhinovirus (n = 2; 40%), parainfluenza 2 (n = 1; 20%), human metapneumovirus (n = 1; 20%), and bocavirus (n = 1; 40%). 

All seven women with RSV illness during pregnancy delivered live born infants (Table 3) . Two (29%) infants were born prematurely at 34 and 36 weeks gestation to mothers who had RSV six and two weeks before birth, respectively. Of the five infants with known birthweights, 1 (20%) was low birthweight and 1 (20%) was small for gestational age. Among infants born to women without RSV during pregnancy, 678 (25%) of 2736 infants with weights measured within 72 hours of delivery were low birthweight. In addition, 469 (13%) of 3612 infants were premature and 63 (2%) of 3719 infants were stillbirths. Growth data was available for 5 (63%) infants born to pregnant women with RSV; median six month Z-score for weight was -0.8 (IQR, -3.0-0.7) and six month Z-score for length was -0.5 (IQR, -2.1-0.4). For infants born to mothers without RSV during pregnancy, the median six-month Z-score for weight was -1.0 (IQR, -8.5-3.7) and six-month Z-score for length was -1.1 (IQR, -12.0-3.7). With the small number of infants born to mothers having had RSV during pregnancy, no statistical testing was done to compare these characteristics. 

Among the 7 mothers with RSV in the six months following birth, 4 of their infants also had RSV. Two infant-mother pairs had RSV detected on the same day. For two additional pairs, the infant and mother had RSV four weeks apart. Of these two, in one pair, the infant had RSV detected four weeks following maternal RSV detection and in the other, the mother had RSV detected four weeks following infant RSV detection. All 3 pairs with RSV typing available from both the mother and infant had the same subtype (2 subtype A; 1 subtype B). The median differences in RSV viral load between mothers and infants was 1.9 log 10 copies/mL (range, 1.5-3.5).

Active home-based viral surveillance in rural Nepal was utilized to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of febrile RSV disease in pregnant and postpartum women. RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in pregnant women, and did not result in any hospitalizations or deaths in this population.

Maternal vaccination is recommended in many countries to protect women and their infants against influenza, tetanus, and pertussis [2] . Influenza infection during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of maternal mortality, as well as low birthweight and smallfor-gestational age infants [6] . The mechanism for this is unknown, but may be related to physiologic changes related to pregnancy, decreased cardiopulmonary reserve leading to increased severity of illness, and modulation of the systemic immunologic response to infection [17] . Because of the increased risk of maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes associated with influenza during pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends influenza vaccine be administered at any time during pregnancy [18] . In contrast, pertussis in adults has a relatively milder course compared to the high morbidity and mortality due to pertussis infection in infants. Therefore, pertussis vaccines in pregnancy are administered in the third trimester to maximize transplacental antibody transfer to the infant [19] . RSV transplacental antibody transfer is efficient in mother-infant pairs in South Asia, the United States, and the Gambia [20] . Higher cord blood RSV antibody titers in Bangladesh are associated with decreased risk of serologic infection in infants [21] . Because febrile RSV illness was rare and relatively mild in pregnancy, a potential vaccination strategy would be similar to the pertussis strategy, with prioritization of infant protection from severe disease. Vaccination during the third trimester when antibodies are most likely to be transferred to the infant would maximize protection of the infant in the early postpartum period.

Assessment of risks of RSV infection in women becomes more important as maternal immunization with RSV subunit vaccines is considered as an approach to prevent symptomatic lower respiratory tract disease in both mothers and infants [22] . A phase II trial of a maternal RSV vaccine candidate was recently found to be safe and immunogenic in non-pregnant women of childbearing age [3] . As trials expand to resource-limited settings, it will be important to know baseline incidence rates of RSV infection and adverse birth outcomes in the study population. Previous estimates of RSV incidence in adults in low and middle-income countries have been calculated using outpatient and hospital-based surveillance with estimates ranging from 0.13 to 4.4/1000 person-years in Kenya, Egypt, and Thailand [23] [24] [25] . In the United States, the incidence of RSV in healthy elderly adults was 8.7/1000 person-years; however, in this study, surveillance was only performed between November and April during periods of RSV circulation [8] . The incidence rates of 11.8/1000 person-years during RSV season in this study are comparable to prior studies. The seasonality of RSV in southern Nepal is similar to that observed in previous studies performed in northern India and other regions of Nepal, with a clear peak during the months of September through November [26, 27] . This is in contrast to influenza, which has a less defined season in tropical as compared to temperate regions of the world [28] [29] [30] .

RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in the participants in our study. The median duration of fever was only two days, and total symptom duration was four days. No participants in this study were hospitalized or died due to RSV; this is in contrast to a case report of pregnant women with RSV at an academic medical center in the United States where two of three patients were mechanically ventilated [9] . In contrast to this case report, our study used active home-based surveillance in rural south Asia, a population with low rates of obesity and other risk factors that may increase risk for respiratory failure.

RSV was also detected in a substantial proportion of infants of mothers with postpartum RSV illness, with evidence of the same subtype in mother-infant pairs. This agrees with studies showing mothers as a potential source of RSV introduction to infants in households in rural Kenya [31] . Maternal vaccination may potentially reduce the spread of RSV within motherinfant pairs and other household members if administered close to the time of delivery.

Limitations of our study include lack of collection of samples in mothers whose respiratory symptoms did not include fever, or in mothers without any symptoms. In family studies, RSV is associated with fever in only 5-27% of illness episodes [32] . These studies suggest the incidence of RSV-associated afebrile respiratory illness could be several-fold higher than found in our study, and potentially account for significant numbers of days with symptoms and health care seeking. Febrile respiratory illness due to RSV in our population did result in a median of four days of symptoms and half of the mothers seeking care for their illness. This is in a region of the world where access to health care is limited by poverty, distance, and gender inequality. Studies in healthy military recruits have found that RSV accounts for 11% of clinically significant respiratory illness in this population, and accounted for one day of missed work in 94% of the cases [33] . An additional limitation was our inability to describe the effect of RSV infection on birthweight or other birth outcomes due to the small numbers of pregnant or postpartum women with febrile RSV illness. It is possible that milder cases of RSV disease without fever can have adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes, and we were unable to assess this in our study. We did find, however, no mortality or hospitalization due to RSV in this population.

In conclusion, symptomatic febrile RSV illness during pregnancy and after delivery was rare among mothers in south Asia. These data will inform prevention and therapeutic strategies against RSV in resource-limited settings.

Risk factors for severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus infections among Mexican children in an emergency department,Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization among children younger than 2 years. This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department.,"Bronchiolitis causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide and is one of the most common clinical conditions treated by practicing pediatricians. [1] Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of pediatric patients. This condition causes acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells; increased mucus production; and inadequate oxygenation of tissues, which can permanently damage the respiratory structures. In high-income countries, such as the United States, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis have been estimated at 120,000 cases per year among infants, [2] and the proportion of hospitalizations have tripled between 1980 and 1996, from 5% to 16%. [3] In Spain, the incidence of bronchiolitis is estimated at 7%, and hospital admissions is estimated at 1.79% annually in children younger than 2 years. [4] However, in low/middle-income countries, the data on admissions of children with severe bronchiolitis and their outcomes are seldom up to date.

Bronchiolitis is caused by viral infection in infants and young children. Although many respiratory viruses infect the lower respiratory system, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common etiology of bronchiolitis, and it has been reported as the most frequent cause of infant hospitalization annually in developed countries, such as the United States and Spain. [5, 6] In fact, about 90% of children suffer an RSV infection during the first 2 years of life, [7, 8] and as many as 40% present with lower respiratory tract infection initially. [9] Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis, including rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. [10] However, in Mexico, infants and young children with respiratory virus infections and severe bronchiolitis have not been reported in Emergency department data.

Although RSV infection is known as a risk factor for severe bronchiolitis, [11] other risk factors have been associated with the severity of bronchiolitis in infants and young children. These risk factors can be categorized as environmental, maternal, and host factors. Environmental exposure of children or their mothers to allergens, cigarette smoke, overcrowded living conditions, and particulate matter can contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis and cause respiratory airway damage. [2, [12] [13] [14] The host-related factors associated with severe bronchiolitis are male sex; congenital heart disease; and a history of premature birth, mechanical ventilation as a neonate, low birth weight, or short birth length. [6, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Other associated risk factors in infants with severe bronchiolitis include the lack of breastfeeding, delivery by elective caesarean section, maternal age, inadequate prenatal care, incomplete vaccination history, and a family history of asthma. [6, 14, 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] These risk factors related to the severity of bronchiolitis in children have been reported in Europe, North America, and South America.

In Mexico, a history of premature birth and a family history of asthma were associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years, and factors that had protective effects were early ablactation, considered as introduction of other foods different to milk before from four months of age, and breastfeeding. [17] However, the associations of the other risk factors associated with severe bronchiolitis in hospitalized children have not been studied in Mexico. For that reason, we analyzed the respiratory viruses implicated in severe bronchiolitis among children 2 years or younger and estimated the impact of the known risk factors associated with severity of this disease to implement better pediatric care in Emergency departments in low/middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of respiratory virus infections in children 2 years or younger and estimate their associations with established risk factors for severe viral bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department in a public hospital in Mexico.

This retrospective, case-controlled study included all children 2 years or younger who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis in the Emergency department at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca from September 2012 to January 2015. Severe bronchiolitis was defined as rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, and increased respiratory effort (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, and intercostal and/or subcostal retraction), with symptoms of severity (e.g., increased respiratory rate, retractions, and oxygen saturation at 90% or lower). [25] All these children with severe bronchiolitis-diagnosed were hospitalized in ward. In addition, clinical information about healthy age-matched children, that received care for healthy children control, from the same period of time was used as the control group. Informed consent was obtained from the children's parents at the time of clinical evaluation. The Research Council and Ethical Committee of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca approved the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 1983.

Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis, age 2 years or younger, date of birth during the study period, birthplace in Jalisco, Mexico, and respiratory virus detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate. Exclusion criteria included previous hospitalization for bronchiolitis, previous use of bronchodilators or corticosteroids, the lack of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections and/or demographic data, birthplace outside the catchment area, and absence of respiratory virus isolated in nasopharynx aspirate. Healthy children 2 years or younger, with no history of respiratory symptoms or previous hospitalizations during the past 6 months, who were born in the catchment area and received care from the Preventative Medicine department in our hospital were included as a healthy control group.

The Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca is a tertiary-level hospital that provides medical care to people from rural towns and urban cities of western Mexico, many of whom have a low income and very limited access to social security or health insurance. The Emergency department has 2 consultation offices for triage evaluation, 6 beds for ambulatory fluid resuscitation, and 23 beds for pediatric hospitalization (8 for newborns and 15 for pediatric patients). Twelve emergency pediatricians and 24 nurses attend to pediatric patients that arrive at this department for any emergency.

The medical records of children included in this study were independently reviewed by 2 pediatricians, and the information was recollected using a standardized questionnaire in the moment that the child was present at Emergency or Preventative Departments for evaluation. The following demographic data were investigated: age, sex, date of birth, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, previous hospitalizations, history of previous respiratory disease, and birthplace. All mothers were interviewed to determine their children's exposure to potential or known risk factors for severe bronchiolitis, including the following: history of inadequate prenatal and neonatal care (e.g., whether mother was evaluated by a medical doctor at least 9 times during the pregnancy [24] ), intake of vitamins and calcium during of pregnancy, exposure to cigarette smoke, [26] delivery by elective caesarean section, [23] premature birth (gestational age < 37 weeks [15] ), requirement of mechanical ventilation during the neonatal period, [15] congenital abnormality (e.g., persistent ductus arteriosus, Down syndrome [15, 19] ); children's health history: breastfed for at least 6 months [21] (if the children were less than 6 months of age and they were being breastfed, was considered to have this criteria), completed vaccination schedule for the child's age (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and hepatitis B vaccines at birth and hepatitis B vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age; pentavalent acellular pertussis, rotavirus, and pneumococcus vaccines at 6 and 7 months of age; and annual influenza vaccines [27] ), daycare, [28] or malnutrition (i.e., deficiency of weight/age, index weight/age, height/age, and weight/height were obtained from the children, and then the nutrition indexes were analyzed [29] ); family health history: asthma, allergies, atopy, and rhinitis in family members [18] ; and environmental factors: passive exposure to house smoking, [30] excessive moisture in the house (coexistence of molds or black spots on the walls), overcrowding, [12] pest infestation in the house, and coexistence with pets. [18, 30] 

Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained upon admission from all children with a diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis who were Robledo-Aceves et al. Medicine (2018) 97:9 Medicine enrolled in the study. The presence of respiratory virus was analyzed using a standard procedure. [31] Viruses were placed in viral transport medium and maintained at 4°C. The samples were stored at -80°C until their viral nucleic contents were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected and identified using the CLART PneumoVir array assay (Genomica S.A.U., Madrid, Spain) in 3 steps (extraction, amplification, and hybridization array), according to the manufacturer's protocol. This kit is based on 2 end-point multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR amplification and subsequent DNA microarray (hybridization) detection. This assay detects single or mixed infections with 17 different respiratory viruses: adenovirus; bocavirus; coronavirus; enterovirus (echovirus); influenza A virus H1N1/2009; influenza viruses A, B, and C; metapneumoviruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses (PIV) type 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B; rhinoviruses; and RSV A and B. Sensitivity and specificity values of 90% or more are reported per the manufacturer.

Briefly, the viral genomes were manually obtained from 200 mL of samples with an extraction kit included in the assay, then eluted in 20 mL of elution buffer. RT-PCR was carried out in 2 different ready-to-use amplification tubes with specific primers for the respiratory viruses listed below. One multiplex-PCR tube for amplification of coronavirus, metapneumovirus (subtypes A and B), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 (subtypes A and B), and RSV type A; and another multiplex-PCR tube for amplification of adenovirus; bocavirus; enterovirus, influenza virus C, metapneumovirus, and RSV type B. These tubes have a mixture of retrotranscriptase and DNA polymerase enzymes for amplification both RNA and DNA viruses. During the amplification process, the amplified products were labeled with biotin. These biotin markers act as reference system for the automatic alignment of the array grid, and serve as control of the reagents performance. A specific 120-to 330-base pair fragment of the viral genomes was amplified. In addition, an internal control (200 mL of solution dilution) was used to ensure the proper performance of the process of amplification.

After the amplification process, the amplified products were hybridized with their respective probes that were immobilized at different sites on the array. Then, they were incubated with streptavidin peroxidase to generate an insoluble product that precipitates at the hybridization sites in the array. Hybridization occurred in a low-density microarray containing triplicate DNA probes that are specific to the respiratory virus studied. All these products were visualized by using CAR automatic reader (Clinical Array Reader) (Genomica S.A.U.).

The continuous variable data are reported as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The demographic data, respiratory viruses detected, and risk factors are given as simple frequencies and proportions. Statistical associations were determined by Student t test, Chi-square test, or Fisher exact test, when appropriate. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square test and odds ratio (OR) calculated for risk factors. A Pvalue < .05 was considered statistically significant, and the confidence interval (CI) was set at 95%. All risk factors with significant OR (P < .05) and those with P < .20 were chosen for further evaluation. Logistic regression was used to analyze independent risk factors. Two models were built using enter and conditional forward-selection methods, and then a final model was built. The risk factors that significantly changed the Chisquare value of the model were preserved. The following risk factors or protective variables were entered: exposure to cigarette smoking, having completed the vaccination schedule for the patient's age, breastfeeding for at least 6 months (in children older 6 months of age), a family history of asthma, and male sex.

During the study period, 134 cases of severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus confirmed in pediatric patients 2 years or younger were treated in the pediatric Emergency department, and none were hospitalized on 2 or more occasions. Table 1 summarizes the demographic data of the patient and health control groups; the data were compared between both groups. The mean age of children with severe bronchiolitis was 6.6 ± 5.7 months (range, 1-24 months), which did not differ from that of the control group (mean age, 6.61 ± 5.6 months; P = .748). The patient group was predominantly male (60.5%, 81/134), but the control group was not (39.5%, 53/134; P = .0006).

Several respiratory viruses were identified in the nasopharyngeal samples from the 134 children with severe bronchiolitis ( 

We investigated various potential risk factors in children with severe bronchiolitis and in the healthy control group ( Table 3 ). The following risk factors were independently associated with severe bronchiolitis: male sex, having persistent ductus arteriosus at birth, maternal history of asthma and/or allergies, history of www.md-journal.com exposure to cigarette smoking, a family history of cigarette smoking, overcrowding, and coexistence with animals. In contrast, the protective factors we found in the children with severe bronchiolitis were adequate prenatal care, maternal history of taking prenatal calcium, and having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age.

The final model of logistic regression analysis of the risk factor independently associated with severe bronchiolitis in children 2 years or younger is shown in Table 4 . Only exposure to cigarette smoking was an independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99-6.18; P = .0001) and having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age was the only protective factor identified (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87; P = .010).

Respiratory virus infections are the most common cause of bronchiolitis in children worldwide, and RSV is well recognized as the most prevalent virus in severe bronchiolitis among infants treated in Emergency departments. In our study, we found that RSV type A or B was the most frequently isolated virus, and all mixed viral infections included RSV and another respiratory virus.

It is important to note that we did not find an association for severe bronchiolitis among cases of children with severe bronchiolitis with viral coinfections, as has been reported previously. [28] Our findings also contrasted with previous reports in which rhinovirus and metapneumovirus were the most frequent viruses isolated from children with bronchiolitis. [11, 22, 28] In addition, is contrasting with our study the fact of metapneumovirus and adenovirus were the respiratory virus reported most frequently in Mexican children (under 5 years of age) who had acute respiratory infection during winter and spring, and did not require being hospitalized in Emergency department. [32] Although we detected rhinovirus, PIV type 3, and other respiratory viruses in the children with severe bronchiolitis in our study, further large-scale investigations are necessary to estimate the prevalence of these respiratory viruses in different pediatric settings and their implications in the severity of respiratory infections.

Several environmental and host factors have been implicated in the development of severe bronchiolitis in children during their first 2 years of life that require treatment in an Emergency department, and numerous studies have analyzed the association between these risk factors and severe bronchiolitis. However, few studies have been performed using infants hospitalized with severe bronchiolitis whose viral infections were confirmed, and few studies have included the incidence of these risk factors in the general pediatric population in which this investigation was done.

Exposure to cigarette smoking is a major cause of increased risk of hospitalization due to bronchiolitis among infants and young children. In this study, exposure to cigarette smoking was the only independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis treated in the Emergency department at our hospital. This result is consistent with those from previous studies that reported children's exposure to maternal cigarette smoking increased the risk of hospitalization in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. This result suggests that exposure to cigarette smoking decreases pulmonary function in children 2 years or younger, which in turn, results in an increased number of visits to the Emergency department. [2, 12, 17, 18, 33, 34] Regional campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of avoiding exposing young children to cigarette smoking should be reinforced to decrease acute inflammation, hospitalizations, and permanent damage to their lower airway systems.

Other environmental factors that we found to be associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in our bivariate analysis were living in overcrowded conditions, having a pest (e.g., termite, flea, tick, or rodent) or cockroach infestation in the house, and coexisting with pets. Although previous reports have not shown that overcrowded living conditions is associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in infants, [17, 35] overcrowding is a well-known risk factor for severe bronchiolitis. [1, 8, 25] In addition, these associated environmental factors, that were found in our study, may reflect that our hospital primarily serves a low-income population that lacks health insurance. One earlier study reported that living in low-income conditions influences the severity of viral bronchiolitis, [30] but the presence of pets, pest infestation in the house, or farm animals did not. [17, 35] However, the contribution of these environmental factors to worse outcome of viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children is well studied; thus, studies in similar populations are required to analyze these associations. Family factors that were associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in this study were maternal history of asthma and allergies, as have been previously reported in Mexico. [17] However, risk factors such as exposure to cigarette smoking during pregnancy were not associated with severe bronchiolitis in the children studied, contrasting with findings reported previously in Spain and North American. [2, 26] This could be a secondary effect of campaigns against smoking during pregnancy that have been undertaken in Mexico, but are not related with the lack of association between severity of bronchiolitis and pregnancy smoking in this study. Comparable results have been published in Italy. [14] However, activities that prevent smoking Table 4 Multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with severe viral bronchiolitis.

Crude odds ratio (95% CI) Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) P * during pregnancy should have been followed because it is a wellknown risk factor that influences the severity of bronchiolitis in infants and young children.

With respect to the host risk factors that affect severe bronchiolitis, we found that male sex and having persistent ductus arteriosus at birth were associated with severity. This is consistent with the fact that persistent ductus arteriosus at birth increases the severity of bronchiolitis because congenital heart disease compromises hemodynamic function, which has been reported previously. [6, 16, 19] In addition, being a white male is associated with severe bronchiolitis. [2, 16, 21] Although these host risk factors cannot be avoided to decrease severe bronchiolitis presentation, they should be taken into account when the child arrives to be treated at the Emergency department to improve their care.

Finally, we found that having a complete schedule of vaccinations was a protective factor to prevent severe viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children. This could be a surrogate factor linked to better socioeconomic status and better life habits, as less tobacco smoke, less crowding, or better medical assistance. However, socioeconomic status or parent's level of education was not possible to compare between patients and controls because this information was missing in the majority of the cases, being a limiting of our study. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health provides the seasonal flu vaccines to all children older than 1 year, but vaccination against RSV is not available to date. Although this protective association does not explain the decreased incidence of severe bronchiolitis among vaccinated children, it is important to note that these data reflect that the healthy control group had better health care, including vaccinations against preventable infections. Pregnancy history factors, such as adequate prenatal care and taking calcium during pregnancy, were protective factors for severe viral bronchiolitis in this study. Although a previous report did not find these factors protective, [24] studies in low-income populations should be done to more thoroughly investigate these protective associations.

In summary, RSV infections were the most common respiratory virus isolated in infants and young children with severe bronchiolitis. Therefore, to significantly reduce the incidence of hospitalizations due to severe bronchiolitis, we must develop vaccines against RSV infections. In addition, to minimize children's exposure to cigarette smoking, the National Ministry of Health should reinforce public campaigns to avoid the exposing infants and young children to cigarette smoking.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus infection in pregnant women,"Objective: To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of 7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasalpharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results: During the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or reenrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. Conclusion: RSV had an attack rate of 10-13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women.","Infection with respiratory pathogens during pregnancy can result in mild to severe acute respiratory illness (ARI). Due to the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience severe outcomes when infected with a respiratory pathogen [1] . Infection with influenza during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality, preterm birth, and infants that are small for gestational age [2, 3] . To prevent these adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunization with influenza vaccine during pregnancy [4] . The ACIP also recommends maternal immunization with the Tetanus-Diphtheria-acellular Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine [5] given that, although adult infection with pertussis is often mild, maternal antibodies transferred to the infant can prevent pertussis-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable age group [6] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) among infants and young children, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality in these populations [7] [8] [9] . There is currently a robust pipeline of RSV vaccine candidates in various preclinical and clinical phases of development. One strategy targets protection of infants less than three months of age through maternal vaccination. Maternal RSV antibodies are efficiently transferred transplacentally to the fetus during gestation, and have been associated with decreased risk of RSV infection in young infants [10] [11] [12] . For this reason, maternal immunization appears to be a promising strategy to prevent severe RSV disease in infants. However, the direct benefit to pregnant women from maternal immunization against RSV is currently unknown.

Maternal RSV infection has not been well defined, both in regards to rate of infection and consequences of infection. A case-series study was the first to describe severe RSV infection during pregnancy: two of the three cases were hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation [13] . In addition, several large prospective maternal cohort studies of influenza-like illness (ILI) evaluated during influenza vaccine trials have described maternal RSV infection incidences of 3.9/1000 person-years in Nepal, 5.3/1000 person-months in South Africa, and 0.3/1000 persondays in Mongolia [14] [15] [16] . Recently, a retrospective multicountry study of ARI-related hospitalizations among pregnant women identified 846 women who were tested for RSV during the influenza season, 21 (2.5%) had detectable RSV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [17] . Of the 21 cases, 13 had a pregnancy complication, 8 were diagnosed with pneumonia, and 6 had subsequent preterm birth. We previously described the frequency and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in women seen during the second and third trimester of pregnancy at a primary obstetrical and gynecological clinic [18] . In this manuscript we expand on the clinical and diagnostic laboratory findings of pregnant women infected with RSV.

Detailed methods for patient enrollment and sample collection have been previously published [18] . In summary, pregnant women in their second or third trimester of gestation were enrolled from November 3 through May 10, during the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, as defined by local surveillance, as they received routine prenatal care at an obstetrical/gynecological clinic in Houston, Texas, whether they were asymptomatic in the prior two weeks (healthy controls) or when they had selfreported symptoms of ARI (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis) in the prior seven days (cases) (Fig. 1) . Upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) was defined as the presence of any of the following: rhinorrhea, sore throat, or cough. LRTI was defined as the presence of any of the following: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis. At any point in the study, healthy controls were allowed to re-enroll if they developed an ARI, and those initially enrolled with ARI were allowed to re-enroll (1) if they developed a new ARI, or (2) as a healthy control.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions and serum samples for both ARI cases and healthy controls were obtained at enrollment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and at a two-week phone follow-up. Each subsequent enrollment was treated as a new event, with collection of nasal-pharyngeal secretions and serum samples at re-enrollment, as well as clinical outcomes two weeks later.

The rate of PCR-confirmed RSV ARI in pregnant women was calculated by two approaches. The first was based on the participants' ARI vs. healthy status at first enrollment (65 ARI cases and 90 controls). The second approach was based on the first ARI episode and includes those women who were first enrolled as healthy and subsequently re-enrolled as an ARI case (77 ARI cases and 78 controls).

RSV infection was determined by PCR or serology. ARI was attributed to RSV infection if RSV PCR was positive. Acute RSV infection diagnosed by serology required at least two serum samples more than two weeks apart to observe a four-fold or greater increase in RSV specific neutralizing antibody titer or a Western Blot infection profile. However, because the serum samples did not bracket a particular ARI, the viral cause of the ARI could not be definitively confirmed. When only one serum sample was available that had a Western Blot profile consistent with infection subjects were designated as having had a recent prior RSV infection [21, 22] .

PCR: The PCR assays were performed as previously described, in a CLIA certified Respiratory Virus Diagnostic laboratory (CLIA ID# 45D0919666). Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for a number of respiratory pathogens, including RSV/A and /B [18] [19] [20] .

Western Blot: The RSV-Western Blot assay was utilized to determine serological evidence of a recent prior RSV infection when only one serum sample was available or of an acute serologic infection when two or more serum samples were available for analysis. This was done by evaluating antibody binding patterns to internal [nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix-2 (M2-1)], and surface [attachment (G) and fusion (F)] RSV proteins, as previously described [21, 22] . A recent prior RSV infection was suggested by detecting bands to one or more internal viral proteins in a single serum sample, and an acute serologic RSV infection was identified when there was an increase or new RSV protein band(s) identified in the second serum sample compared to the first serum sample. Previous studies indicate that the banding patterns seen with a recent prior RSV infection suggest that a person has been infected sometime within the last year [21, 22] .

Microneutralization Assay: Serum neutralizing antibodies against RSV/A (Tracy) and RSV/B (18537) were quantified using a previously described qualified microneutralization assays [23] . Neutralizing antibody titers were defined as the final dilution at which there was a 50% reduction in viral cytopathic effect (CPE). The lowest limit of detection was 2.5 log 2 . Any sample resulting in a titer below the lower limit of detection was assigned a value of 2.0 log 2 . Individuals who developed a four-fold or greater rise in neutralizing antibody titer between the serum samples collected at enrollment and subsequent re-enrollment were reported to have an acute serologic RSV infection.

Palivizumab Competitive Antibody Assay (PCA): A PCA assay was performed as previously described to detect the concentration of palivizumab-like antibodies (PLA) that compete with biotinylated palivizumab for binding to antigenic site II of the fusion protein of RSV [24] . The source of the fusion protein was from sucrose purified RSV/A/Bernett (GA1 genotype) that was coated onto the 96-well plate for 18 h. The lower limit of detection was 1 lg/mL.

Those samples with undetectable levels of PLA were assigned a value of 0.5 lg/mL.

Data from the Texas Department of State Health Services were utilized to define the RSV season [26] . For Houston, the 2015-2016 RSV season was defined as the timeframe in which the percentage of positive RSV antigen tests rose above the 10% threshold (onset, week 43) and decline below 10% threshold (end of season, week 12).

A 5-15% incidence of community acquired RSV was used to estimate sample size. A total of 150 or 71 subjects per group were required for 5% or 10% respective incidence rates of RSV infection to show a 5% difference in RSV incidence between RSV-infected pregnant women and healthy pregnant women using a power of 80% and an alpha level of 0.05.

Frequencies of demographic, clinical data, and laboratory findings were determined for RSV-infected and healthy control groups. Frequency distributions between groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. An independent t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare mean or median values of continuous demographic and clinical data between groups. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) with a 95% confidence interval was calculated to compare the difference in the geometric mean titers (GMT) of the serologic data between groups. Stata software version 14.2 was used to perform all statistical analyses [25] .

At their first enrollment there were 65 pregnant women with ARI and 90 healthy pregnant women controls. Twelve of the ninety healthy pregnant women controls were re-enrolled later during the RSV season with ARI. Similarly two pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment were re-enrolled twice more with new ARI. [18] .

Among the 65 pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment, 39 (60%) had PCR evidence of a respiratory pathogen, of which seven (11%) were PCR-confirmed RSV infections. When expanded to include all women with an ARI during the study period, among 77 enrolled pregnant women with an ARI, 47 (61%) had PCR evidence of a respiratory pathogen, and eight (10%) were PCR-confirmed RSV infections. Thus, the rate of RSV ARI by initial enrollment during the RSV season was 11% (7 of 65) and by ARI episode it was 10% (8 of 77).

We compared women with PCR-confirmed RSV infection (n = 8) to pregnant women who were enrolled as healthy controls (n = 90). There were no significant differences between pregnant women with PCR-confirmed RSV and healthy pregnant women controls in regards to demographics or medical history (Table 1) . Asthma was uncommon in both groups and allergies were reported by three (38%) individuals with PCR-confirmed RSV and 42 (47%) healthy pregnant women. Co-morbidities and complications in current or previous pregnancies were similarly infrequent in both groups.

All patients with PCR-confirmed RSV reported symptoms of ARI in the week prior to enrollment ( Table 2 ). The time post-onset of symptoms at enrollment ranged from 1 day to 9 days, except for one individual who reported 25 days of symptoms. Cough (n = 7/8), congestion (7/8), and sore throat (6/8) were the most common symptoms among those with PCR-confirmed RSV ARI. Three (37.5%) patients reported fever. Four (50%) patients with PCR-confirmed RSV infection reported symptoms of an upper respiratory illness (congestion, sore throat, or cough), and all had symptom onset <6 days prior to enrollment. Four of eight women (50%) with PCR-confirmed RSV had symptoms consistent with a LRTI (shortness of breath or wheezing) and all were 6 days post-onset of symptoms. These four individuals also reported fever, chest pain, nausea or diarrhea, loss of appetite, and decreased activity with a greater frequency ( Table 2 ). All women with RSV-LRTI also reported a previous ARI during their pregnancy, one of which developed into pneumonia.

Most women with PCR-confirmed RSV ARI were seen at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic, and one patient was hospitalized. This patient presented during the peak of the RSV season with sudden onset of fever and uterine contractions. She was a 35-year-old, gravida 5, para 1, 35 weeks of gestation with dichorionic diamniotic twins. The physical exam was significant for left costovertebral angle and flank pain; she reported general malaise. The patient was started on antibiotics and supportive care. During her stay she developed symptoms of LRTI and was treated with azithromycin. Within 48 h, symptoms improved and the patient was discharged. Pregnant women in their second or third trimester of gestation were enrolled if they were asymptomatic (healthy controls) in the prior two weeks or if they had symptoms of ARI in the prior seven days. At any point in the study, pregnant women were allowed to re-enroll. The total number of women initially enrolled with symptoms of ARI was 65. Taking into consideration those 12 healthy controls who reenrolled when they developed symptoms of ARI, the total number of women with ARI during the study period was 77. The total number of women who re-enrolled was 15. She was enrolled into the study five days after hospital discharge and was still reporting congestion, cough, and sore throat. These symptoms resolved 10 days after discharge.

The duration of illness for women with PCR-confirmed RSV ranged from 7 to 30 days. In general, those who were enrolled later in their illness (6 days) experienced a longer illness. Two women (25%) continued to report symptoms when contacted at their two-week follow-up (Table 2) . Four (50%) reported the use of over-the-counter medications, including antihistamines, cough medicine, and pain relievers. Two (25%) were prescribed medications, including antibiotics and inhaled glucocorticoid.

Of the three pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment who subsequently re-enrolled in the study, one exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection profile. In addition, of the twelve women initially enrolled as healthy controls who later reenrolled in the study with ARI symptoms, two exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection profile (Table 3 ). In total, 3 (20%) of 15 pregnant women had serologic evidence of RSV infection. None of these individuals had PCR-confirmed RSV. One woman (Case 9) was initially enrolled as healthy control, but developed symptoms of an ARI by her two-week follow-up, and was secondarily enrolled as an ARI case. Similarly, Case 10 was also enrolled as healthy control and reported symptoms of ARI at two weeks. However, she was not re-enrolled into the study until 30 days after her first enrollment when she reported an additional instance of ARI. Case 11 was initially enrolled with ARI and 7 weeks later enrolled a second time as a healthy control.

In combining the PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate based on health status at initial enrollment during the RSV season was 12% (8 of 65) and by ARI episode it was 13% (10 of 77).

The majority of patients did not re-enroll in the study and, as a result, only had one serum sample available for Western Blot analysis. Of the eight patients with PCR-confirmed RSV, six did not have Western Blot evidence of a recent prior RSV infection (Table 4 ). These six individuals were enrolled early in their infection (1-8 days of illness onset) and therefore we did not expect to observe PCR, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.

Data are mean ± standard deviation (SD), Median and interquartile range (IQR), or n (%). * Two healthy controls had two co-morbidities. an antibody response to their RSV infection. Two patients with PCR-confirmed RSV had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection profile; these two individuals were enrolled on days 9 and 25 of their illness onset. Of the 88 healthy controls enrolled during the RSV season, 28 (31%) had a Western Blot profile consistent with recent prior RSV infection.

It would be expected that if RSV infection occurred during the RSV season, the greatest proportion of women with a recent prior RSV infection would occur later into the season when (1) greater exposure to RSV has occurred, and (2) time to develop an immune response following the RSV infection has elapsed. In Houston, the RSV season began on CDC week 43 and peaked weeks 3-4, ending week 12 (Fig. 2) . Overall, the rate of patient enrollment was greatest in the first third of the RSV season (weeks 43-50). The proportion of healthy controls with serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection significantly increased from 21% (13/62) in the first third of the RSV season, to 43% (6/14) in the second third, and 64% (9/14) in the last third (p < 0.004). In addition, two healthy controls were enrolled shortly after the end of the RSV season (weeks 13 and 15) and are included in Fig. 2 .

Healthy controls had serum neutralizing antibody GMT of 173.5 for RSV/A and171.7 for RSV/B, while the GMTs for women with PCR-confirmed RSV were 245.1 and 234.8, respectively. The two women with PCR-confirmed RSV who were enrolled on days 9 and 25 (Table 4) The geometric mean of PLA concentration of healthy controls (6.4 mg/mL) was similar to that of women with PCR-confirmed RSV (5.8 mg/mL). However, those two individuals with PCRconfirmed RSV infection who were enrolled later in their illness (days 9 and 25) had comparatively greater levels of PLA, 25.3 lg/mL and 10.5 lg/mL respectively.

PCR-confirmed RSV contributed to 10 or 11% of ARI cases based on initial enrollment status or first ARI episode, respectively, among pregnant women in our study. Because we enrolled women seen at an outpatient clinic regardless of history of fever, we were able to capture the full range of clinical manifestations of RSV infection in pregnancy without a selection bias for severe or concurrent disease. We found that 50% (4/8) of the pregnant women with PCR-confirmed RSV had symptoms of LRTI; this included one woman who was hospitalized, possibly related to her RSV illness.

Previous studies have documented the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology [26, 27] . Utilizing both techniques we identified RSV infection in acute samples by PCR and convalescent samples by serology. RSV was identified by PCR in 11% (7/65) of pregnant women with symptoms of ARI at their initial enrollment. Taking into account one additional woman who exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection, the RSV attack rate was at least 12% (8/65) of ARI cases. An RSV attack rate as high as 13% (10/77) is estimated if calculated using the first ARI episode. This is substantial given that the RSV season in Houston was relatively mild compared to previous years [28] , and greater than reported by maternal studies of respiratory illness in Nepal and Mongolia, where RSV accounted for 2% and 2.4% of ARI cases, respectively [14, 15] . However, because fever was an inclusion criteria for those studies, and fever occurs in less than one-third of adult RSV infections, these numbers may be an underestimate [29] . Our attack rate of 12-13% is similar to that of other studies with broad ARI inclusion criteria in adults. In a four year study of ARI in high risk adults, RSV was detected in 46 of 519 (10%) cases [9] . Similarly, a 20-year study of otherwise healthy adults found that 7% of individuals with respiratory illness were infected with RSV [30] .

Nearly one-third (32%, 28/88) of healthy pregnant women enrolled during the RSV season had evidence of a Western Blot profile consistent with a recent prior RSV infection and, based on serology, 2 of 12 (16.7%) healthy pregnant women went on to develop an RSV infection during the RSV season. Recent studies have reported findings wherein at least 20% of women of childbearing age had serologic evidence of an acute RSV infection [21, 31] . In our study, the percentage of healthy pregnant women with a Western Blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection increased significantly as the RSV season progressed. These women had enrollment dates that followed the peak of RSV illness in Houston. This suggests that these healthy controls may have been infected with RSV during the course of this study. A caveat in our method of defining the RSV season is the use of the RSV antigen test as a marker for infection. A recent study found that utilizing PCR as an alternative diagnostic tool allows for a more expanded RSV season and, as a result, an increase in the RSV cases reported [32] .

RSV infection during pregnancy resulted in a range of clinical manifestation of ARI illnesses. Cough, congestion, and sore throat were the most common symptoms among those with PCRconfirmed RSV. In previous studies of ILI, pregnant women with RSV generally reported a mild, febrile illness restricted to the upper airways [14, 15] . In our study women who reported fever also had symptoms of LRTI. Although none of the women were diagnosed with pneumonia, the morbidity attributable to RSV was significant. One woman did report symptoms of LRTI during hospitalization for fever and uterine contractions and was found to have PCRconfirmed RSV several days after hospital discharge. She, like those in the case-series by Wheeler et al, reported co-morbidities that may have put her at risk for a more serious illness [13] .

Due to differences in study design and sample collection, it is difficult to make comparisons between our study and others that have documented maternal RSV infection. Three of the previous studies were prospective, wherein a participant was actively followed during the RSV season by weekly visits or telephone calls, sampled when she became ill, and followed for clinical outcomes through the duration of her pregnancy [14] [15] [16] . However, these study participants were only sampled when they reported ILI or sought medical attention for their respiratory illness. The retrospective case-series describes three patients identified through tertiary care records [13] . These studies may select for a more severe illness or illness restricted to ILI. Conversely, in our study we captured women in different stages of their illness.

Of the eight women with PCR-confirmed RSV, only two had serological evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot. Both were enrolled well into their illness, at 9 and 25 days, giving them time to develop an RSV specific immunological response. This is also evident by their comparatively greater levels of neutralizing antibodies and palivizumab-like antibodies [9, 33] . Three women who were re-enrolled and had paired sera, exhibited an RSV infection profile despite negative PCR. It is likely that these women were exposed to RSV sometime between their first and second enrollment visit. Although we cannot definitively establish causality, it is possible that RSV infection was responsible for some or all of the symptoms these three women reported. Twenty-eight healthy controls had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot testing of a single serum sample, suggesting they had been infected with RSV at sometime within the year.

The proportion of healthy controls with a Western blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection significantly increased in the latter part of the RSV season. This suggests that many of these healthy women had been infected with RSV earlier in the current RSV season and, that by the time of study enrollment, sufficient time had elapsed to develop an RSV-specific antibody response.

Our study is limited in its size and duration. Because patients were enrolled at a single site over one RSV season, we were only able to capture eight women with PCR-confirmed RSV. However, this proportion is greater than that reported by other studies to date and, given our broad inclusion criteria, we were able to describe a range of RSV clinical manifestations. The case definition is limited in that it is dependent on self-reported symptoms, and LRTI was not confirmed by radiologic study. In addition, because serum samples were collected at the time of enrollment, only one serum sample was available for most patients, unless participants chose to re-enroll in the study at a later time. Given this, RSV case identification by serology was dependent on the number of serum samples provided: patients with sequential serum samples could be identified as having an acute serologic RSV infection, while patients with a single serum sample could be identified as having had a recent prior RSV infection.

In summary, RSV is a common cause of ARI during pregnancy with appreciable morbidity. Although the primary goal of maternal immunization against RSV is to protect young infants who are at increased risk for severe disease, a maternal RSV vaccine may also directly benefit pregnant women. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates move forward in evaluation, additional priority should be placed on evaluating the impact of RSV disease prevention in pregnant women.

Risk of mortality associated with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza infection in adults,"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection constitutes a substantial disease burden in the general population. However, the risk of death for RSV infection has been rarely evaluated with confounders or comorbidities adjusted. We aimed to evaluate whether RSV infection is associated with higher mortality than seasonal influenza after adjusting for confounders and comorbidities and the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality in patients with influenza infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult (≥18 years) patients admitted to the emergency department and ward of a university teaching hospital for suspected viral infection during 2013-2015 (N = 3743). RSV infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR (N = 87). Adults hospitalized for seasonal influenza during the study period were enrolled as a comparison group (n = 312). The main outcome was 20-day all-cause mortality.We used Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate the relative risk of death. Results: Adult patients were less likely to be diagnosed with RSV than with influenza (2.3 vs 8.3%, respectively), were older and more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypoxemia, and bacterial co-infection. In patients with RSV infection, the 20-day all-cause mortality was higher than that for influenza, (18.4 vs 6.7%, respectively). RSV infection showed significantly higher risk of death compared to the seasonal influenza group, with hazard ratio, 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17-4.58). Oseltamivir had no significant effect on mortality in patients with influenza. Conclusions: RSV infection was significantly associated with a higher risk of death than seasonal influenza, adjusted for potential confounders and comorbidities.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, and usually requires hospitalization, with the occurrence of death in extreme cases [1, 2] .

During the past decades, many studies have clearly demonstrated RSV as a serious pathogen in certain adult populations including long-term care facilities [3] [4] [5] [6] and immunocompromised host [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although RSV infection in adults is often mild, the effects of RSV infection can be substantial in both healthy adults and hospitalized patients [11] . RSV infection can cause significant morbidity in hospitalized patients, with mortality rates up to 12% [12] . A recent study showed that hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia related with viral pathogens, influenza, and RSV comprised of 21% and 11% among all viral pathogens, respectively [13] .

A retrospective cohort study showed that RSV infection, in combination with bacterial co-infection was associated with increased risk of mortality [14] . RSV infections may contribute to 5% to 10% of cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [15] , and 7% of asthma admissions [11] in adults. Virus infections including RSV may explain seasonal mortality in the elderly [16] .

In the 1990's, Influenza had attributable mortality more than 4 times higher than RSV in the elderly in a population-based study [17] . However, in the 2000's attributable mortality of influenza was less than 2 times compared with those of RSV [18] . Attributable hospitalization due to RSV was almost two-thirds those of influenza [19] . RSV is an increasingly common cause of illness and high morbidity in adults. A better understanding of complications and outcomes of adults hospitalized with RSV compared to influenza infection would be useful to identify high-risk adults. Furthermore, oseltamivir has been commonly prescribed in influenza infected patients since 2009. However, the efficacies of oseltamivir treatment are contradictory [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

We investigated the 20-day all-cause mortality rate for hospital admitted patients with laboratory confirmed RSV compared to influenza. We also investigated the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality of patients with influenza infection.

A retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with RSV infection was conducted. All patients aged ≥18 years admitted between January 2013 and December 2015, with suspected respiratory viral infections (N = 3743), were studied. If physicians suspected respiratory viral illness, then virus multiplex PCR was performed. We excluded 2980 subjects who had no identifiable viral infections, and 364 patients with viral infections other than influenza A/B or RSV infection (Fig. 1 ). RSV patients (n = 87) were compared with patients diagnosed with seasonal influenza (n = 312) during the same period (2013-2015).One patient had a mixed infection of influenza and RSV. Among RSV-infected patients, one patient had a mixed infection with bocavirus. Among influenza-infected patients, 5 patients had mixed infection with bocavirus, and 3 patients with coronavirus. All the patients with mixed infections were included in this study except the one patient who had a mixed infection of influenza and RSV.

The current study was approved by the institutional review board at Dongsan Hospital, Keimyung University School of Medicine. The need for written informed consent was waived. This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

An upper respiratory infection was defined as the presence of one or more of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sputum production, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or dyspnea. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate found using chest radiography, in addition to two or more of the following: fever, sputum production, rhinorrhea, sore throat, dyspnea, or a diagnosis of pneumonia by the attending physician. The outcome was designated as all-cause mortality up to 20 days after hospital admission. 

During the study period, nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained using flocked swabs and stored and transported using the universal transport medium (COPAN, Brescia, Italy). Nasopharyngeal specimens were submitted for respiratory virus detection. Nucleic acids were extracted from 300 μL specimens using a Viral Gene-spin™ Viral DNA/ RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea). cDNA was synthesized from each of the extracted RNA samples with cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biomaterials, Foster City, CA, USA).

Respiratory virus (RV) 16 testing was performed to detect the following viruses: adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, Rhinovirus A/B/C, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and bocavirus. During the RV16 test, an internal control was added to each specimen to check the entire process from nucleic acid extraction to PCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used to detect 14 types of RNA viruses and two types of DNA viruses, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay was conducted in a final volume of 20 μL containing 8 μL of cDNA, 4 μL of 5 × RV primer, 4 μL of 8-methoxypsoralen solution, and 4 μL of 5 × master mix with the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

This study was performed at Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, a 867-bed, tertiary care teaching hospital in Daegu, Republic of Korea. If a patient had an episode of acute respiratory infection at an emergency department or outpatient clinic or within 2 days during admission, he or she underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) who underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing between January 2013 and December 2015 were identified by electronic medical records. We collected clinical data using the electronic medical record on general characteristics, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, lower respiratory complications, requirement of supplemental oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support, hospitalization duration, and allcause mortality. Chest radiography was performed on all patients admitted to the hospital, and radiographic interpretation was performed for all RSV and influenza cases by radiologists. Additional laboratory investigations were performed based on the results of a routine blood test. Sputum samples were collected for bacterial culture preparation at admission and during hospitalization. Blood cultures were also performed when indicated. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) consisted four parts, demographics including age and sex, co-morbidity, physical examination, and laboratory findings [26] . PSI score was collected every admitted patient. We contacted patients or their families by phone to identify survival and clinical information if the patients were not followed up regularly.

Baseline characteristics (including age, sex, residency in a long-term care facility, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and complications) at date of admission for cases and control patients were summarized using descriptive statistics, such as proportion and means (standard deviation, SD). A Chi-squared test was applied for comparison between categorical variables, and two-tailed t-tests, for comparison between continuous variables. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Fifty-two patients had missing data on body temperature due to lack of measurement in the outpatient clinic. We imputed 52 missing values for body temperature, 10 for RSV group and 42 for influenza group, using a sequential regression approach [27] , assuming that body temperature was missing at random conditioning on all covariates included in the analysis.

The univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the risk of death from RSV infection compared to that of seasonal influenza. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) score and resident of long-term care facilities were excluded from the final model due to multicollinearity with age. The multicollinearity between adjusting variables was checked by the variance inflation factor (VIF) and the tolerance statistic [28] . The largest VIF was 2.05 for PSI score and average VIF was 1.28. The smallest tolerance was 0.48 for PSI score. However, more detailed collinearity diagnostics indicated collinearity between age and PSI score. And when age and resident of long-term care facilities were entered simultaneously into the model, the hazard ratio for age changed its polarity. We analyzed survival curves for case and control subjects by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared them using the log-rank test. We assessed the assumption of proportional hazards with graphical and goodness-of-fit (GOF) approaches [29] . We considered ties when using Cox proportional hazards with the Breslow method [29] . Adjustments were made for sex, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body temperature > 37.5°C, pneumonia, hypoxemia and bacterial superinfection. Selection of covariates for the model building was based on clinical relevance and availability. The candidate variables for adjusting were sex, age, resident of long-term care facilities, COPD, high body temperature, pneumonia, bacterial superinfection, hypoxemia, and PSI score. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS V.21.0 (SPSS Version 23 for Microsoft Windows, IBM, Armonk, NY).

RSV seasonal peaks occurred during January in 2013, December in 2014, and January in 2015 (Fig. 2) . The influenza season was defined as period between January and April, and was determined based on the weekly surveillance reports for influenza and other respiratory viruses prepared by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

RSV infection was diagnosed in 87 adult patients (54 A and 33 B), and influenza infection, in 312 adult patients (244 A and 68 B), during the 3-year study period. The percentage test positivity rates during this period were 2.3% and 8.3% for RSV infection and influenza, respectively among all patients tested with respiratory viruses multiplex PCR.

The average age of RSV-infected patients was older than that of influenza patients (70 and 62 years, respectively) ( Table 1) . RSV patients were more likely to be residents of a long-term care facility or to have COPD, pneumonia, or respiratory bacterial superinfection. Hypoxemia was more frequent and body temperature > 37.5°C was less common in RSV patients than in influenza patients (Table 1) . Oseltamivir was prescribed for 248 influenza patients (79.4%). Mechanical ventilation was used for 3 patients (3.4%) with RSV infection, and for 7 patients (2.2%) with influenza. Mean PSI score was 21 points higher in RSV infection (107.5) than influenza (86.5).

All-cause 20-day mortality rates were higher in RSV patients than in influenza patients (18.4 and 6.7%, respectively) (Fig. 3) .

After adjusting for potential confounders and comorbidities, the hazard ratio (HR) (2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-4.58) of 20-day all-cause mortality was significantly higher for RSV than influenza ( Table 2 ).

Eighty percent of influenza virus infected patients were treated with oseltamivir (n = 247), while the other 20% of these patients were not prescribed oseltamivir (n = 65). They were less likely to be treated with oseltamivir if diabetic, otherwise similar groups (Table 3) . Oseltamivirtreated patients had no significant difference in mortality than the patients not treated with oseltamivir did; the 20-day all-cause mortality rates were 6.4% and 7.6%, respectively (P = 0.72, Fig. 4 ).

This study showed that all-cause mortality within 20 days after hospital admission was higher in patients with RSV infection (18.4%) than in those with influenza (6.7%) and adjusted hazard ratio (RSV vs. influenza) was 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17-4.58). However, oseltamivir had no significant effect on mortality in patients with influenza.

Previous epidemiologic study and retrospective cohort suggested the mortality rates related to RSV infection in the elderly was estimated 2-17% [12, [30] [31] [32] [33] . The varying mortality rates related with RSV infection might be explained by high viral load and severity of infection [32, 33] . In this study, the high PSI score in RSV infection might represent the severity of infection, which may partly explain the higher mortality from RSV infection in the current study than previously reported.

RSV infection is a significant cause of death in infants less than 12 months of age [34, 35] . The serious problem of RSV was underestimated in elderly individuals until the 1970s [36] . Epidemiologic studies revealed that the RSV infection, like influenza infection, is also a significant cause of death or morbidity in elderly individuals [17, [37] [38] [39] [40] . However, the risk of mortality with RSV infection in the presence of comorbidities or confounders has not been explored well. In the present study showed RSV infection was an independent risk factor for mortality adjusting variables. Although RSV data was based on both antigen detection and viral isolation methods [17] , only antigen detection tests were used in the surveillance report since 2008 [41] . In addition to RSV, real-time PCR for detection of influenza viruses was implemented in the 2000's [42] [43] [44] . Since realtime PCR is more sensitive than antigen detection or virus isolation [45] , there may be a difference in the description of the epidemiology between the pre-and post-PCR time periods. Thus, detecting methods may influence on virus epidemiology. Therefore, it would not be reasonable for direct comparison between previous epidemiologic studies and the present study.

Oseltamivir therapy showed effectiveness on reducing mortality in influenza infection [22] [23] [24] . However, there are still controversies about the effect of oseltamivir on the outcome of influenza-infected patients [21, 25] . In the present study, oseltamivir was prescribed in almost 80% of influenza infection cases. Although the difference in mortality rates failed to reach statistical significance, there was a trend towards influenza-infected patients treated with oseltamivir having a lower mortality rate than influenza-infected patients who were not treated with oseltamivir. We suspect that oseltamivir may partly contribute to the difference in mortality rates between RSV and influenza infection cases in the present study. Our study showed that in adult patients, RSV infections can also cause pneumonia, resulting in respiratory failure in a higher proportion than seasonal influenza. RSV is the most significant cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children [46] and is known to be a significant cause of severe acute respiratory infections in elderly people [11, 47] . In our study, pneumonia was diagnosed in 39.1% patients. In 1984, similar results were observed in a nursing home for elderly during an outbreak of RSV infection [48] .

In the present study, patients with RSV infection exhibited lower body temperature more frequently than patients with influenza did. In 2007, Walsh et al. [49] also reported that RSV infections were more commonly associated with lower temperature than influenza, and a greater proportion of RSV patients The variables, resident of long-term care facilities and pneumonia severity index score, were not included due to collinearity RSV respiratory syncytial virus, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval. Hazard ratios were calculated using a Cox Proportional hazards regression model [39] in 1995 and Dowell et al. [47] in 1996. The PSI was developed as a clinical prediction tool to guide doctors in deciding between inpatient or outpatient treatment of pneumonia patients [26] . Viral pneumonia may not be detected using simple chest radiography; however, ground glass opacity can be identified using chest computed tomography. Furthermore, RSV and influenza infection may have a significant impact on vital signs, as well as on laboratory findings. In the present study, the PSI score was significantly higher in RSV infection cases than in influenza cases by 21 points. We speculate that RSV infection may result in a more serious inflammatory response than influenza infection.

Although RSV infection accounted for only 2% of all adult respiratory viral infections in the present study, RSV infection should not be regarded as insignificant. If patients are suspected of having RSV infection, a prompt test for the respiratory virus should be the first step towards confirming diagnosis and treating patients. In addition to performing the test, the result should be made available quickly. Identification of the virus, as well as patients who are at a high risk of death, would help in prescribing antiviral therapies appropriately. Recent advances in the development of antiviral therapies for RSV are promising [50, 51] , ensuring more options for treating RSV infections in the near future. If an effective vaccine for RSV becomes available, it would be prudent to target high prevalent groups, such as nursing home residents.

This study has several limitations. First, the absence of RSV or influenza in the nasopharynx does not exclude the presence of RSV or influenza in the lower respiratory tract. Thus, the results may underestimate RSV infection or influenza in lower respiratory tract infection. However, it was unlikely to affect the HR estimates. Second, we did not take into consideration vaccination against influenza, which may have reduced the impact of influenza illness. Third, data were retrospectively collected. Missing data and inadequate documentation including time to start medication may have resulted in biases in the study analysis. Fourth, there is a need for validation of the results with extended hospitals because of limited sources of the patients.

Our study showed that although RSV was detected less frequently in hospitalized adult patients, it was associated with a significantly higher risk of 20-day all-cause mortality than seasonal influenza.

Viruses causing lower respiratory symptoms in young children: findings from the ORChID birth cohort Respiratory infection,"Introduction Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause substantial child morbidity. Sensitive molecularbased assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. Methods One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. Results Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms. Discussion The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits.","Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children, either on their own or in synergy with bacterial pathogens. 1 Virus-positive ARIs early in life are associated with developing wheeze and asthma during childhood and adolescence. 2 Community-based studies from the 1950s to 1960s examining the aetiology of ARIs by traditional laboratory detection methods remain the template for understanding childhood respiratory virus epidemiology. 3 Advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR testing, have improved virus detection in those with ARIs. 4 However, this increased test sensitivity has also resulted in viruses being detected in asymptomatic individuals. 4 5 The clinical significance of finding respiratory viruses is not always straightforward, and a better understanding of the proportion of infections that are symptomatic for individual viruses is needed.

The attributable fraction in the exposed (AFE) provides information about the percentage of cases among exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure. In our study, the AFE measures the percentage of ARIs in virus-positive children attributable to that particular virus. The AFE does not inform on the aetiology at an individual level, but is a key population-level metric for interpreting positive specimen results. It assists with estimation of the true burden of disease, thus guiding preventative strategies for respiratory infections, such as immunisation. Virus-specific AFE estimates for ARI in children are reported infrequently, with most studies reporting AFEs having important methodological limitations. Except for one community

What is the key question?

► What is the attributable risk for symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when specific respiratory viruses are detected by PCR assays in nasal swab samples collected weekly from otherwise healthy young children?

► Attribution for ARIs by specific viruses was strongest for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus in young children with lower respiratory tract infections, while among DNA viruses tested, only adenoviruses were significantly associated with an increased risk of symptoms.

► The virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs is a population-level metric to inform causal inference in the aetiology of ARIs and provides quantitative estimates of the relative proportions of virus-associated ARIs in the community, yielding important insights for prioritising public health interventions.

study, 5 these investigations recruited either highly selected hospitalised children or outpatients as study cases, [6] [7] [8] or used controls from outpatient clinics. 6 7 A meta-analysis of 23 studies that calculated virus-specific AFEs included 22 studies employing hospital-based case ascertainment and only three using community-based controls. 9 Other studies comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic groups calculated odds ratios (ORs), [10] [11] [12] or relative risks, 13 without calculating AFEs. Moreover, several studies focused solely either on specific viruses 10 12 or outcomes. 6 11-13 Longitudinal, community-based studies employing sensitive molecular-based assays with regular and frequent sampling, irrespective of illness, are best suited to explore the relationship between respiratory virus detections and ARI symptoms, especially as they represent most ARI episodes. The aim of our study was to examine the disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses in infants participating in a community-based birth cohort project 14 and to calculate their virus-specific AFE values.

The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) project ( clinicaltrials. gov: NCT01304914) is an observational, longitudinal community-based birth cohort study of ARI episodes in children until their second birthday. 14 Participants were able to leave the study temporarily (such as during family holidays) and rejoin at a later date. It was conducted in the subtropical city of Brisbane, Australia (latitude 27° South, average monthly maximum temperature range 22°C-30°C, maximum rainfall in December-February, population 2.2 million) between September 2010 and October 2014. Parents consented antenatally for their child's participation. For enrolment, infants needed to be healthy, without congenital abnormalities or underlying chronic disorders, and to be born at term (36-42 weeks). Recruitment was progressive over 2 years at one of two metropolitan hospitals (one private and one government-funded). Detailed methods of recruitment, study design and sample and data collection are described elsewhere. 14 The Children's Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, and The University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committees approved the study.

Following recruitment, parents provided their sociodemographic and health history, pregnancy and birth details. Telephone interviews were conducted every 3 months to update immunisation, feeding and childcare attendance details. Childcare was categorised as formal (regulated care outside the child's home) or informal (non-regulated care provided by family or friends). 15 The duration of exclusive breast feeding was from birth to the introduction of either any milk formula or solids.

Parents were trained to recognise respiratory symptoms and provided with diary cards designed in a tick-box format and listed with predefined respiratory symptoms or diagnoses to be completed daily and returned by regular mail monthly. The diary cards were modified from a prior study 16 and used successfully elsewhere. 17

Viruses were identified from parent-collected anterior nose swabs at the infant's birth, and weekly thereafter. 18 Specimens were mailed to the laboratory, taking a median of 3 (IQR 2-4) days, and where they were processed and stored at −80°C until further analysis. 14 19 Swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses: human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza A and B (IFV-A, IFV-B), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV-A, RSV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3), human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), human polyomaviruses WU (WU-PyV) and KI (KI-PyV) and human bocavirus-1 (HBoV-1), using previously validated real-time PCR assays. 14 Details of sample collection, processing, PCR assay parameters, quality control measures and HRV typing into species A, B  and C are outlined in the online supplementary text and E-table  1 . Specimen quality was assessed by testing for a marker of human genomic DNA, endogenous retrovirus-3 (ERV-3). 20 Swabs with ERV-3 cycle-threshold (Ct) values >38 (including undetectable Ct values) were deemed to be of lesser quality and excluded from parts of the analysis. 21

New virus detection episode When a new virus (different virus or new species/subtype of the same genus or species, respectively) was detected in a swab by PCR testing, or the same virus was detected after at least two negative intervening swabs, or the same virus was detected at least 30 days from the last positive swab.

When symptoms were reported 7 days before or 7 days after detecting a new virus.

ARI was defined as a new episode of respiratory symptoms of the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts demarcated by a window of ≥3 symptom-free days. 17 22 Upper respiratory tract infection Parent-reported runny nose/nasal congestion, dry cough or doctor-diagnosed otitis media. 22 

Parent-reported rattly breathing, moist cough, shortness of breath, wheeze or doctor-diagnosed pneumonia. 22 ARIs were subcategorised hierarchically as either a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), respectively.

The incidence rate of single new virus detection episodes (VDEs) per 100 child-years was calculated using Poisson regression. To account analytically for the differing lengths of time children remained in the study, the natural logarithm of the number of swabs returned was included in the model as an offset. Swabs were removed from incidence rate calculations for individual viruses when the participant was not at risk of a new VDE (a positive consecutive swab following the initial positive swab, and two swabs after the last positive swab, as per our definition of a new VDE), or the swabs were of lesser quality (to avoid underestimating incidence rates). 21 When calculating incidence rates for 'any virus', we assumed children were at risk of being positive for new viruses in every swab.

The virus-specific risk and AFE of single VDEs in cases of ARI and LRTI were estimated using a generalised linear model with binomial family and log link. Robust variance estimates were calculated using sandwich estimators to account for repeated measures within children. We analysed LRTIs separately as children with these infections are more likely to visit family physicians, present to hospital and receive antibiotics. 22 The AFE was The association between potential risk factors (age, sex, type of delivery, gestational age at birth, season, family history of asthma or eczema, tobacco smoke exposure, household size, maternal education status, mode of feeding, category of childcare attendance) and symptomatic and asymptomatic virus detection was examined using mixed-effects logistic regression with the child entered as a random effect to account for repeated measurements within children. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Breast feeding and childcare attendance were analysed as timevarying variables. Multivariable models included all the above risk factors with no forward or backward selection. Only virus-negative Table 2 Respiratory viruses detected in 8100 high-quality nasal swabs collected from 157 infants from the Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) birth cohort in the first 2 years of life. Incidence rates/100 child-years presented overall, and for the first and second years of life separately 

Of 891 potential participants approached, 165 (18.5%) eligible singleton infants from 163 families were enrolled (two families enrolled two siblings) (figure 1). Seven were excluded subsequently; one from ineligibility (born <36 weeks) and six for failing to provide any swabs. 

When calculating incidence rates, of the 11 192 total swabs submitted by all children, 3025 (27.2%) lesser-quality swabs (346 virus-positive and 2679 virus-negative) were removed from the analyses, as were 67 swabs submitted after the child's second birthday, leaving 8100 swabs from 157 infants (figure 1). Overall, 

When considering virus-positive ARIs and asymptomatic episodes, we retained 346 virus-positive swabs with ERV-3 Ct values >38, but removed a further 244 swabs with missing symptom data, to give a final dataset of 8202 swabs from 151 participants (3 participants submitted swabs of high or no Ct values or swabs with no corresponding symptom data before withdrawing early in the study) (tables 3-5).

Of 8202 swabs, 3894 (47.5%) were taken during symptomatic periods and 4308 (52.5%) from asymptomatic periods. Of all swabs taken any time during symptomatic periods, 1903/3894 (48.9%) were positive for a virus, and 1120/3894 (28.8%) were new VDEs. Overall, 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs taken during asymptomatic periods were positive for a virus, of which 562 (57.1%) were new VDEs and 491/562 (87.4%) were new single virus detections (tables 3 and 4). Table 3 shows that for new VDEs involving only single viruses, HRV-A, HRV-C, IFV-A, PIV-3, RSV-A, RSV-B, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HMPV, and AdV had statistically significant, positive AFE values, indicating they were significantly more often associated with ARI episodes than asymptomatic periods. In Table 4 Lower respiratory tract infections and asymptomatic single new virus detections, risk ratios and attributable fractions by respiratory virus in 151 children from the ORChID birth cohort (n=5267 swabs) Continued contrast, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, WU-PyV, KI-PyV, and HBoV-1 were frequently detected in asymptomatic periods and had low point estimates for AFE, indicating they were less likely to have caused the ARI. Of the total 1641 ARIs, 111 (6.8%) did not have swabs submitted during the ARI episode, including swabs taken 7 days before or 7 days after the last day of the illness. Of the remaining 1530 ARIs, 1154 (75.4%) ARIs (935 (81%) URTI, 219 (19.0%) LRTI) had ≥1 swabs with a virus detected during this period.

RSV and HMPV were more strongly associated with LRTI than asymptomatic detections (table 4), with higher risk ratios than other viruses. While significant, the association between LRTI and HRV-C, HCoV-OC43 and PIV-3 detection was weaker. Interestingly, codetected specimens had among the strongest AFE values for both ARIs and LRTIs (tables 3 and 4), with HRV the most frequently detected virus group, usually in combination with DNA viruses (see online supplementary E-table 3).

To investigate the sensitivity of results from including lesser quality swabs, we reanalysed the data by excluding 346 virus-positive swabs of lesser quality, and found minimal change to the AFEs calculated in tables 3 and 4 (see online supplementary E-table 2).

Independent risk factors associated with symptomatic rather than asymptomatic VDEs, included increasing age, particularly after 6 months, and virus infections during non-summer seasons (table 5 ). The regression model revealed childcare attendance was also independently associated with higher rates of VDEs, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, but no other risk factors were found to be associated with asymptomatic VDEs.

Healthy children in the ORChID community-based birth cohort experienced an incidence rate of 978 new VDEs per 100 childyears during the first 2 years of life, with HRV playing a dominant role. Overall, respiratory viruses were detected by PCR in regular weekly swabs at least once during 75% of ARIs, while in asymptomatic periods 23% of weekly nasal swabs were positive by PCR for respiratory viruses, accounting for 33% of all new VDEs. We demonstrated evidence of attribution for ARIs by RNA viruses, which included HRV (HRV-A, HRV-C), influenza (IFV-A), parainfluenza (PIV-1, PIV-3), RSV (RSV-A, RSV-B), HCoV (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) and HMPV; and AdV as the single DNA virus representative. All these viruses were detected significantly more often in children with an ARI than during asymptomatic periods and had statistically significant positive AFEs. The largest association was observed for RSV and HMPV, both of which were more strongly associated with LRTIs than other respiratory viruses. Increasing age ≥6 months, non-summer months and childcare attendance were independent risk factors for symptomatic VDEs. Age as a host risk factor for symptomatic infection is also noted in other studies, 23 and is presumably due to protection afforded by maternal transplacental and breastmilk antibodies in the very young. 24 Environmental risk factors of season and childcare attendance for ARIs may be related to the intensity and opportunity for exposure in these settings experienced by young children. 10 

The virus-specific attribution of ARIs was quantified by identifying VDEs during asymptomatic periods and calculating the virus-specific AFE, an infrequently reported metric for helping to determine the relative causal roles of different viruses at a population level. A limitation of the AFE approach is that it cannot inform on the aetiology at an individual level: in individual cases it does not differentiate between those with a true positive test identifying the virus responsible for the ARI and those with a false positive result from asymptomatic virus shedding. Nevertheless, knowing the AFE for respiratory viruses can help inform clinicians on the likely clinical significance of detecting one or more viruses in nasal swab specimens taken from infants or young children during an ARI episode, by assigning the group aetiological fraction for viruses detected in that child. Importantly, AFE estimates can be applied to studies of ARIs in different settings to estimate the true burden of disease in the community, thus informing which viruses should be prioritised in future public health policies and interventions.

Most previous studies have overestimated AFE values by using ORs, rather than RRs, in calculations. 5 6 8 9 ORs overestimate the effect size when the event is not rare, as occurs with ARIs in children. These studies are principally cross-sectional, hospital-based and often have poorly matched controls. Consequently, our estimates of AFE being lower than reported elsewhere is not surprising, and, we believe, are likely to provide more accurate estimates of the ARI and LRTI burden attributable to these viruses in the broader paediatric population.

The proportion of asymptomatic infections in our study highlights the risks of extrapolating hospital-based data from sick children to the community setting. Previously, the significance of detecting viruses by PCR was tempered by concerns that this may be from an incubating or unrelated subclinical infection or represent continued virus nucleic acid shedding from a recent ARI that has resolved. The intensive longitudinal specimen and symptom sampling from our cohort, as well as the definitions of VDEs and symptomatic VDEs used, helped identify nascent and subclinical infections. In this context, our observations emphasise the frequency of subclinical infections by respiratory viruses in young children, who when otherwise well, may act as important 'silent' reservoirs of infection. Similar observations and conclusions were reported recently in a household study involving both child and adult contacts of symptomatic cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza. 26 Nevertheless, in addition to influenza, established viruses, such as HRV, PIV-3, RSV, and HMPV are also important community respiratory pathogens, especially the latter two viruses, and potential candidates for vaccine and other therapeutic interventions. 27 This contrasts with the novel DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1, which have low AFEs calculated for both ARIs and LRTIs, despite their higher detection rates. 28 29 However, as suggested by this cohort, synergy may exist between multiple viruses causing ARIs. Unexpectedly, this involved mostly HRV and DNA viruses, and this finding warrants further study.

The 78% of expected child-days and 68% of expected swab returns was a very good retention rate given the intensive and prolonged nature of the study for participating families. Analysis of incidence rates of ARI in participants that withdrew from the study at different periods showed no clear association between time of dropout and ARI incidence. Regular parent-collected nasal swabs avoids the need for home visits by research staff or clinic attendance during an ARI, minimising possible biased estimates of ARI events and specimen availability from losing families failing to seek healthcare. Moreover, regular weekly nasal swab collections increase the likelihood of virus detections during an ARI episode rather than relying simply on results from a single specimen. Our previous work found that with sensitive PCR techniques, parent-collected nose or nose-throat swabs sent to the laboratory by standard mail had comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs obtained by healthcare workers. 18 19 30 Longitudinal data collection also allows assessment of asymptomatic status by considering past and future illness history, as some viruses are detectable days before and after ARI symptoms develop, 31 and are therefore less likely to yield false-positive findings.

There are also some important limitations to consider. To reduce the chances of false-negative test results, 21 we excluded from analysis 2679 (23.9%) swabs where the internal control for human DNA, ERV-3, was either undetected or present at very low levels. We excluded both virus-positive and virus-negative swabs to avoid overestimating our incidence and prevalence rates. In addition, some viruses were detected rarely, in particular influenza, a finding reflected in other community studies, 17 but nevertheless limiting our ability to provide precise AFE estimates for these agents. We also excluded codetections in individual virus assessments as multiple aetiological agents make individual contributions of each agent difficult to ascertain, but analysed them separately to look at the association patterns of individual viruses. Symptom information, other than doctor-diagnosed otitis media and pneumonia, captured by daily diaries was not validated. To maximise accuracy, parents were trained to recognise symptoms before commencing the study. While healthcare worker-validated symptoms would be ideal, a study of this scale is logistically challenging without parent participation. This study design has been used previously 18 and with others have shown that parents can be trained to recognise symptoms of interest, 18 often as reliably as healthcare professionals. 32 33 Our rates of ARI, including those associated with wheeze, are comparable with other community studies. 34 35 Finally, as is common for these types of studies, families in our cohort were from more advantaged backgrounds and ARI episodes were predominantly of a mild-to-moderate nature. 22 While many children in our study were first-born and from advantaged families, factors thought to decrease the rate of ARIs, secular changes in Australia have led to an increased proportion of children from these families attending childcare at an earlier age than other sectors of the population. A slightly higher proportion (80%-85%) of our cohort attended some form of care by the age of 15-24 months, compared with 74% of children in the Australian population, with childcare attendance an independent risk factor for ARIs. 25 Moreover, the incidence of ARIs in the ORChID cohort 22 is comparable to other reports in this age group 34 36 37 and RSV and HRV-associated ARIs approximate other community-based studies conducted in more temperate climates of Australia (Perth) and Europe. [38] [39] [40] Our findings for this cohort remain valid and provide important estimates on community respiratory virus exposures and ARIs in Australian children in a subtropical, urban setting.

Respiratory viruses, particularly HRV, were detected with remarkable frequency in healthy Australian children in the first 2 years of life, with at least one-third of new VDEs unaccompanied by symptoms. With molecular methods used increasingly to detect respiratory viruses in young children, our study provides insights into supporting attribution for virus-specific ARIs in this age group managed within the community. The established RNA respiratory viruses and AdV were more strongly associated with symptomatic than asymptomatic infections, while no such associations were found for the newly described DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1. These data emphasise the high community levels of HRV circulating among children. Importantly, they also provide evidence to suggest that the current clinical trials of candidate RSV and HMPV vaccines seeking to protect infants against severe disease and hospitalisation might also deliver substantial health benefits for all young children within the community. 27 Correction notice This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.

Statins May Decrease the Fatality Rate of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Infection,Citation Yuan S. 2015. Statins may decrease the fatality rate of Middle East respiratory syndrome infection. mBio 6(4):e01120-15.,"T he recent paper by Totura and colleagues (1) revealed that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling contributes to a protective innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Despite the importance of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) as public health threats, there are currently no drugs available to treat these coronaviruses, with current evidence suggesting that the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon (IFN) are only slightly efficacious in ameliorating SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections (2) . Now human-to-human infections of MERS-CoV are more frequently reported, with a total case fatality rate of 37.7% (2). Therefore, a feasible but effective treatment is needed urgently, especially treatment with FDA-approved drugs, including some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.

Like avian influenza viruses (AIVs), MERS-CoVs set off a cytokine storm (3), which is likely to lead to the subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, some immunomodulatory therapies were suggested for respiratory virus infections, such as celecoxib, mesalamine, cyclosporine, and the TLR4 antagonist eritoran (4). TLRs play a critical role in the recognition of pathogens and induction of the innate immune response to many viruses. The TLR3 agonist poly(I·C) and the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are protective against SARS-CoV infection in mice (1). TLR4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice are resistant to acute lung injury via AIV infections (5) . However, TLR4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice have significantly more disease resulting from SARS-CoV infection than wild-type mice (1). The protective signaling via TLR4 pathways may be a unique feature in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses compared to other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza viruses (1) .

Despite the opposite functions of TLR4s in AIV and SARS-CoV infections, MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88; downstream of TLRs) plays an important role in the survival of respiratory virus infections (Fig. 1) . The MYD88 gene was observed to be highly induced by SARS-CoV infection (1). Interestingly, either excessive expression of MYD88 (1) or a deficiency in MYD88 expression (6) resulted in high mortality rates after MERS-CoV infections, implying that a balanced immune response is crucial for survival of respiratory virus infections.

Downstream of TLR-MYD88 pathways, activation of NF-B is a hallmark of coronavirus infections, and inhibition of NF-B reduced lung infection and significantly increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection (7) .

Among TLR-MYD88 antagonists, statins are the most common FDA-approved drugs (atorvastatin will be sold as an OTC drug). Statins do not affect the MYD88 level significantly under normal conditions but maintain (stabilized) MYD88 at the normal level during hypoxia or after hydrogen peroxide treatments (8, 9) . Furthermore, atorvastatin at 10 M significantly attenuated NF-B activation within 24 h, whereas at lower doses of 0.1 and 1 M, the treatment time had to be prolonged for up to 48 h for a significant inhibition to occur (10) . Thus, an early and high dose of a statin (such as a single dose of 40 mg atorvastatin per day, equaling a 0.1 M plasma concentration) might be an idea for treatment of MERS-CoV infections. Given that 3-to 10-timeshigher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed after MERS-CoV infection than after no infection (3), statins may not be very effective for late-stage patients. Timely administration of statins may be crucial to surviving MERS-CoV infection.
