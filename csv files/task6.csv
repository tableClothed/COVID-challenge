Mass gatherings medicine: public health issues arising from mass gathering religious and sporting events,"Mass gathering events are associated with major public health challenges. The 2014 Lancet Series on the new discipline of mass gatherings medicine was launched at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014. The Series covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health-care providers from mass gathering events in 2012 and 2013. This follow-up Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases and antibioticresistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents, and non-communicable diseases, including thermal disorders. In the events discussed in this Review, the combination of a large influx of people, many from countries with outbreakprone infectious diseases, with a high degree of crowd interactions imposed substantial burdens on host countries' health systems. The detection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj raise concern of possible globalisation from mass-gathering religious events. Priorities for further investments and opportunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of these public health issues are discussed.","A mass gathering is defined by WHO as a planned or spontaneous event that gathers substantial numbers of attendees who might strain the health planning and response capacities of the host community, city, or country. 1 Mass gatherings can present important public health challenges related to the health of attendees and of the host country population and health services. 2 The concept of mass gathering medicine as a specialty emanated from discourse on the 2009 Hajj, which was held during the 2009 HIN1 influenza pandemic (panel 1). 3 The first International Conference on Mass Gatherings Medicine was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October, 2010, where The Lancet Infectious Diseases Series on mass gatherings was launched (panel 1). 4 This conference led to a coalition of experts from virtual WHO mass gathering collaborating centres and global academic and public health faculty 5 to guide develop ment of, and update, optimal public health and medical prevention and treatment guidelines at mass gathering events. 6, 7 Mass gathering medicine as a new discipline was highlighted at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014, where The Lancet Series on mass gathering medicine was launched. 7 These stateoftheart reviews covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health care providers from three mass gathering events: the London 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, 8 the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship finals, 9 and the Hajj pilgrimages of 2012 and 2013. 10 They set out the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks and described existing and potential public health threats (panel 2) and the experiences of healthcare providers.

Since the launch of The Lancet Series in 2014, various public health threats have continued to pose public health challenges for the planning of events and during events at various mass gathering events. This followup Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned religious, sporting, scouting, cultural, and musical mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018: the Kumbh Mela 2013 and 2016 pilgrimages in India, the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts, the UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States, and the Micronesian Games in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan in 2015, and the annual Hajj pilgrimages of 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Saudi Arabia. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases, emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents arising from stampedes and terrorist attacks, and noncommunicable diseases, including heatrelated

The Kumbh Mela, the Hindu religious pilgrimage festival, is the largest mass gathering event in the world, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] it attracts more than 120 million pilgrims from across the world for up to 2 months, and is held every 3 years alternately along the banks of four holy rivers: the Ganga, or Ganges, River (Haridwar district), Godavari River (Nasik district), Kshipra River (Ujjain district), and Sangam River (Prayag district, Allahabad) at a confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. The 2013 Kumbh Mela event was attended by 70 million Hindu pilgrims over 55 days at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. 19 The Kumbh Mela is a highly coordinated and organised event, where WHO recomendations for mass gatherings are implemented (panel 3). 1, 2 The Indian Government and local authorities plan well ahead of each Kumbh Mela event and have established plans for physical and public health infrastructure to be in place. Socalled temporary popup cities that include tents for pilgrims, water pipelines and clean water supply, toilets, sanitation and sewage disposal facilities, vector control and sur veillance teams, security services, and administrative assistance for pilgrims are set up along the river. [20] [21] [22] A range of healthcare facilities are put in place and hospitals are prepared to receive pilgrims requiring inpatient treatment and intensive care for every Kumbh Mela festival. 21 Internal roads and pontoon bridges are built for these popup cities and are designed to streamline and facilitate pilgrim crowd movement and flow. 22 State government irrigation and water resources departments and the Central Pollution Control Board work closely together to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and to ensure sufficient flow to remove contamination by releasing water into rivers. 19, 20 90 000 kL/day of potable water were supplied for the 2013 Kumbh Mela for drinking and cooking, with 550 km of water pipelines were laid for distribution through 20 000 taps. 19 Approximately 45 000 toilets were provided, although there was little health promotion messaging. 21 Similarly to other mass gatherings, random inspection and vaccinations were done for immunocompromised individuals. 21

The Kumbh Mela is unique in that it involves frequent and prolonged bathing by pilgrims in the holy river, a ritual which is believed to break the cycle of reincarnations and convey immortality. 17, 18 Contamination of river water with faeces, urine, saliva, and sputa is inevitable and leads to transmission of waterborne and respiratory tract infections. 12, 14, 20, 21 A notable example of such a cycle of transmission is the 1817-24 Asia cholera pandemic, which was associated with the Kumbh Mela. 23 urination. 21 Bacterial load in the river increased by approximately 130 fold. 12, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] At the 2013 Kumbh Mela, a study 15,16,20 that followed 30 000 pilgrims in four sector hospitals found a 5% incidence of diarrhoeal diseases over a 23day period. A rise in nonbloody diarrhoea cases was seen just 2 days after the main bathing day on Jan 29, 2013, and a peak in upper respiratory tract infections coincided with the peak in nonbloody diarrhoeal disease. The use by pilgrims of fires fuelled by cow dung or firewood resulted in more than 23% seeking cough medicine and smoke from choolahs using wood or coal was the commonest cause of respiratory illnesses among 15 000 patients. 13 The observation that a socalled shaving ritual could increase the risk of bloodborne disease transmission has not yet been confirmed, because the practice is surrounded by secrecy and there is little of information on how widespread it is. 13

The presence of extendedspectrum Î²lactamasepro ducing Escherichia coli in municipal sewer systems and waste water in Hyderabad, India, have sparked concerns that antibioticresistant bacteria could be spreading at massgathering religious events. 26 The rivers of India are known to be polluted owing to inadequately treated household and industrial effluents. 26, 27, 29 A 20 times increase in blaNDM-1 gene carrying bacteria during the pilgrimage on the bank of the Ganges was observed during the 2015 Kumbh Mela. 27 A novel antibioticresistant bacterial species, Corynebacterium godavarianum, has been isolated from the bathing site of the Godavari River. 25 In response to this growing global concern, 28 an expert panel concluded that use of antibiotics should be restricted to acute travellers whose diarrhoea is incapacitating. 30

Since the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in 2015, 22 the risk of crush injuries, stampedes, and other mass casualty incidents, such as fires, have been minimised by close surveillance and constant evaluation of crowd flow. Site preparation and negotiations with the various akharas (sects) to predetermine the order of ritual baths has resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths due to stampedes from about 500 people in 1954 to 37 in 2015 (table). 22

The Festival of Pacific Arts and the Micronesian Games are a feature of PICTs. 38, 39 Although several of the event host countries have a population under 200 000, such as Yap State (population 11 000) in the Federated States of Micronesia that hosted the 9th Micronesia games in July 2018, the health security risks remain the same, and can be proportionally greater, than similar events in larger countries, due to the influx of people and its effect on the fragile health infrastructure of PICTs. Three enhanced surveillance activities for mass gathering events in PICTs occurred during national or regional disease outbreaks that had the potential to severely affect the mass gatherings, place greater strain on health services, and cause substantial tourismrelated economic and reputation loss.

The Eighth Micronesian Games took place in Pohnpei State, Federated States of Micronesia, in July, 2014. 38 Pohnpei is a small island state of around 36 000 people in the western Pacific. The Games attracted about 1700 athletes and officials from several Micronesian countris and territories. In June, 2014, 6 weeks before the opening of the Games, Pohnpei reported the first case of measles in an outbreak that spanned the duration of the Games and the following 3 months and resulted in a total of 251 cases. 40 The UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States was held in Apia, Samoa on Sept 1-4, 2014. 41 Attracting more than 3000 delegates from 115 countries, it was the largest event ever to be hosted by Samoa, a Polynesian island nation in the south Pacific with a population of around 187 000. In late July, 2014, an extensive chikungunya virus disease outbreak began in Samoa that resulted in more than 4000 cases 4 months later. 42 The 12th Festival of Pacific Arts was hosted by the Micronesian island of Guam (population 163 000) in 2016. 43 The Festival was a large event, attracting more than 2500 artists and performers from 27 countries and territories across the Pacific. These island communities (some very small, such as the Pitcairn Islands with fewer than 50 residents) would have been greatly affected by the introduction of a novel disease. The Festival was held Panel 3: Key considerations related to communicable disease alert, response, and operation plans for mass gatherings â¢ Risk assessment and management, surveillance and alert systems, and outbreak alert and response twinned to effective communication strategies â¢ Rapid identification of attendees with communicable diseases and their contacts for potential quarantining and instituting preventive infection control measures â¢ Medical care planning and guidelines (preventive medicine, mandatory vaccinations, food management, water and waste management, and identification of physical and fire hazards) â¢ Public health measures (water protection and provision, food protection and provision, and syndromic surveillance) â¢ Emergency planning and response (rapid access to injured or ill patients, provision of triage in the field and at aid stations, provision of on-site care for minor injuries and illnesses, effective and timely stabilisation and transport of patients requiring evacuation) â¢ Disaster medicine, trauma, and triage and level of care â¢ Mobile units, health stations, and designated hospitals â¢ Use of modern technologies for proactive surveillance, early diagnosis and rapid detection, data collection, analyses, sharing, and communication. â¢ Updating travel guidelines, including vaccinations, for each specific mass gathering event while Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and measles outbreaks were occurring in several participating countries. 40, 42, 44, 45 At all these mass gathering events, the combination of large influxes of people and high degrees of social mixing in the presence of highly infectious pathogens, emerging nonvaccinepreventable diseases, and diseases with incurable long term consequences (eg, Zika birth defects) could have introduced substantial population burdens and consequences for health systems. To counter these threats, enhanced surveillance for these mass gathering events was essential to ensure health security. 41, 46 The three events used enhanced syndromic surveillance that built on the existing panPacific WHOled weekly syndromic surveillance, 47 ensuring host countries were prepared. However, although short, the period of intense activity that characterises mass gathering surveillance is a substantial burden to stretched local public health resources. To alleviate this burden additional support was gained from within host countries and from external partners provided by the Pacific Community, which has extensive experience of mass gathering surveillance, and the Pacific Island Health Officers Association.

Massgathering surveillance in the Pacific has shown the value of a strong foundation in existing disease surveillance and of regional partnerships. These two aspects were essential in host countries' ability to implement comprehensive and intensive massgathering surveillance. However, although the benefit of early warning disease surveillance was established, longer term sustainable surveillance improvements were harder to realise. For example, local public health departments borrowed personnel from other departments and external support, all of whom returned to their previous duties once the massgathering surveillance finished.

The massgathering surveillance was successful 46,47 on all three occasions and showed that even small nations can (with the right support) provide health security in the face of substantial health risks. In doing so, these events proved the value of the mass gathering surveillance in providing health security assurance to event organisers, participants, and local and regional communities as well as showing that small island nations can meet International Health Regulations requirements and implement enhanced massgathering surveillance.

Various public health concerns were raised before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and Paralympics in August, 2016. [48] [49] [50] [51] In February, 2016, WHO declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern owing to the Zika outbreak in Brazil and its association with birth defects. 50 There was global pressure for the Games to be either postponed or moved to another country. 52 The WHO Emergency Committee on Zika virus decided that postponing or cancelling the Games had no public health justification, [49] [50] [51] 53 stating that ""indi vidual risks in areas of transmission are the same whether or not a mass gathering is conducted, and can be minimised by good public health measures"". 50 Because Brazil is a dengueendemic country, the risk of dengue to nonimmune visitors was also a concern, 54 based on the experience from a pilgrimage in Senegal 55 and from GeoSentinel data. GeoSentinel is a global network of travel medicine providers focused on sentinel surveillance, which generates evidencebased assessments of infectious disease risks for attendees of future mass gatherings events. 56, 57 As with the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, 18 WHO provided technical support to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and International Olympic Committee to ensure public health safety during the Games. This support included improving the quality of water for recreation and preventing the spread of Zika virus by increasing vector control efforts. In spite of intensive media coverage, no cases of Zika virus were confirmed among people who attended, both during the Games and since returning to their home countries. 50 gathering events during infectious disease outbreaks with epidemic potential. 60 Before the 2016 Summer Olympics, another concern was related to water sports and athletes being exposed to polluted waters. 61 However, a study 61 done during tests in 2015 showed no increased incidence of diarrhoea among exposed individuals compared with controls. When travellers to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil were compared with other travellers to Brazil during the same period, the majority in both groups were bitten by insects and had sunburns as environmental risk factors, and every third traveller suffered from diarrhoea. 58, 61 Men travelling to the World Cup tended to have more sexual contacts outside of a relationship than a control group of other travellers to Brazil and also had more alcohol intake. 48

The 2018 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Russia between June 14 and July 15, 2018. 62 The event was attended by 3 million people with 32 international teams participating in 64 football matches in 12 stadiums across 11 cities: Ekaterinburg, Kaliningrad, Kazan, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, RostovonDon, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, and Volgograd. 62 Data from WHO's Regional Office for Europe 62 showed that the Russian Federation had reported 454 isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from urban tertiary care hospitals across the country before the event. Carba penem resistance occurred in 74% of Acinetobacter spp isolates, 49% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and 12% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. 23% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillinresistant and 91% of K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. Although no reported major public health incidences were reported, the 2018 FIFA World Cup created heightened awareness of the threat of the transmission and globalisation of antibioticresistant bacteria. No crosssectional or longitudinal cohort studies from the event have been published.

The 23rd World Scout Jamboree was hosted by Japan between July 28 and Aug 8, 2015, and was attended by 33 000 scouts of up to 17 years of age from 162 countries. 63 The World Scout Jamboree is an international Scout Movement camp. It takes place every 4 years, with the site of the Jamboree rotating between continents. The daily schedule includes arduous activities, such as climbing, woodchopping, and knife handling, and preparing one's own meals on gas stoves. Apart from risk of transmission of infectious diseases, injuries, and burns, it induces a range of psychological disorders, inc luding homesickness and behavioural and neuropsychological disorders. 64 No major infectious diseases outbreaks were reported during the Jamboree. However, within 9 days of the end of the event, six cases of laboratoryconfirmed invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitides capsular serogroup W occurred among scouts and their close contacts in Scotland and Sweden. [65] [66] [67] Soon after return to Scotland, three scouts and one relative were diagnosed with invasive meningo coccal disease. These cases were all associated with one scout unit. Two confirmed cases of invasive meningo coccal disease were reported from Sweden. 65 Molecular analysis [65] [66] [67] showed that the same N meningitides isolates were responsible for the six cases and that they belonged to the ST11 clonal complex, which is usually associated with large outbreaks. No other cases were reported from scouts who attended from other European countries or Japan. All participants were made aware of the outbreak and of signs and symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease through an information campaign and were offered ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis. 66, 67 To make a decision on the need for prophylactic treatment for close contacts of returning scouts, throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis were taken. The carrier state in Swedish teenagers was studied comparing sensitivity of throat versus nasopharyngeal swabs from 1020 of the 1890 Swedish teenagers who participated in the Jamboree. The overall positivity for N meningitidis in this group was 83 (8%) of 1020, of which 61 were nongroupable. 67 Further car riage studies are required during mass gatherings to determine the epidemiology and association between carrier isolates and diseasecausing isolates in the population and the dynamics of globali sation from mass gathering events.

Every year an increasing number of people travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. 68 The total number of pilgrims for both the Hajj and Umrah is about 10 million pilgrims annually from more than 180 countries. The Hajj pilgrimages that took place in 2015, 2016, and 2017 each attracted more than 2 million people from outside Saudi Arabia. 68 Several major public health challenges are associated with each Hajj, 10 in cluding transmission of infectious diseases, exacerbation of noncommunicable diseases, mental health disorders, and stampedes (appendix), among others. Infectious diseases surveillance systems are operational during the annual Hajj, and they have evolved from paperbased reporting tools to automated electronic systems, re cording and storing large datasets, and reporting from mobile units, clinics, primary health facilities, and hospitals that serve pilgrims. 10 All these data are fed directly to a central command and control unit, enabling rapid amalgamation and analyses of data and necessary public health interventions. These advances in realtime surveillance have improved public health security for the mass gatherings at the Hajj. 69 See Online for appendix

In the past 5 years, concern has grown with regard to the threat to global health security posed by several emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Because of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2013-16), 69 74 concerns were expressed by the global public health fraternity regarding pilgrims from affected countries travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj or Umrah. 70 The Saudi government implemented restrictions only to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. For pilgrims from Yemen and other countries, intensified screening at points of entry into Saudi Arabia and close surveillance during their stay throughout the Hajj, was implemented, with no cases detected. 68 At the 2016 Hajj, The Indian Medical Mission provided health care to about 400 000 pilgrim patients from August to October, 2016, through a team of 144 doctors, including 50 specialists, 146 paramedics, and 74 ancillary staff. 75 They coordinated a tiered healthcare network, including primarycare static clinics, tent clinics, and mobile medical task forces, secondarycare hospitals, and referral and evacuation capabilities at Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah. Secondarycare referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, ortho paedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab medicine, and radiology. Infectious diseases consituted 53% of outpatient diagnoses, with upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and diabetes related severe infections, particularly cellulitis and pneumonia the most common. Urinary tract infections were common in female pilgrims. 75 Nearly all pilgrims develop a respiratory tract infection during the Hajj, known as the pilgrims' cough. 10 Overcrowding during the Hajj increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), rhino virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, meta pneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrugresistant tu ber culosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ebola, MERSCoV, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. 10, 76, 77 Although the threat of coronaviruses (MERSCoV and severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus) with epidemic potential remains, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] no cases of MERSCoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj or upon return to their home countries. 79 Other corona viruses identified at the Hajj include alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, of which the 229E strain is most common cause of upper respiratory tract illnesses. 82 A systematic review of 31 studies on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in Hajj pilgrims 76 showed influenza, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza continue to be the most common viral infections among pilgrims. At the 2016 Hajj, a study 83 of 266 pilgrims admitted to hospitals with community acquired pneumonia showed that 96 (36%) cases had diabetes, 26 (10%) were smokers, and 108 (45%) cases required intensive care. 48 (18%) cases had invasive S pneumoniae (pneumococcal) infection.

Every year the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health issues updates on travel immunisation recommendations for pilgrims. 10 They are classified as mandatory (required) and voluntary (recommended) before performing Hajj and Umrah. The three mandatory vaccines are the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine for all pilgrims and the Yellow fever and Polio vaccines for pilgrims coming from countries with active polio transmission. 10, 68 Recom mended vaccines include influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. 84, 85 Since the inclusion of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in 2001, 85 no major meningo coccal meningitis outbreaks related to hajj have been identified. [85] [86] [87] However, concern that new serogroups of N meningitidis (eg, B and X), which are not covered in the current quadrivalent vaccine targeting serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, could be a cause of future epidemics is increasing. 88, 89 Owing to the high incidence of pertussis seen among Hajj pilgrims in 2003, 90 Bordetella pertussis is considered a risk in pilgrims, especially those who have not completed their immuni sation schedule. 91 Tuberculosis is the commonest cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. 37 A large percentage of Hajj pilgrims come from high tuberculosisendemic coun tries. The burden of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis in pilgrims attending the 2015 Hajj from five high tuberculosisendemic countries was evaluated by a study randomly screening 1164 pilgrims, 36 of which 15 had previously undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis. With millions of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia from high tuberculosis endemic areas, cases of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis will continue to pose a risk to other pilgrims. Further studies are required to define the scale of the tuberculosis during the Hajj and to develop proactive screening, treatment, and prevention guidelines. 92 Several studies also done on enteric pathogens during the Hajj show the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria (appendix). 33, 34, 93 To prevent emergence of and spread of antibioticresistant bacteria, antibiotic pre scription and consumption by pilgrims at mass gathering events should be rationalised and regulated. Antibiotic stewardship and good prescribing practices should be promoted amongst healthcare providers.

Noncommunicable diseases constitute a large burden on health services at the Hajj. 10, 68, 94 They include diabetes, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, renal failure, chronic obstructive airways disease, prostate hypertrophy and urine retention, thyroid disorders, strokes, neuropsychiatric disorders, heatrelated disorders, traumatic injuries, ear, nose, and throat disorders, and eye ailments. The Indian Medical Mission studied 495 Indian pilgrims admitted for intensive care management during the 2016 Hajj and found that 262 (53%) had respiratory tract infections (53%) and 199 (24%) had traumatic injuries. 68 Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and preexisting comorbidities. A substantial number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj are elderly with preexisting chronic medical conditions. 10,75,95 These pilgrims might be unable to cope with the arduous rituals condensed into a 5day period and thus exacerbation of existing noncommunicable diseases occurs. 95

In contrast to mass gathering religious events, sport and music concerts 96 attract younger individuals of 15-25 years of age. Excessive alcohol consumption and recreational drug use increases the risk of intoxication and injury, extreme behaviours, such as fire jumping (jumping and dancing through flames), 97 sexual activity resulting in transmission of sexually transmitted disease and sexual assault. Additionally, loud noise at music festivals can lead to deafness, hence legislation is needed to keep to certain noise thresholds. 96

At mass gathering events the threat of mass casualty incidents from crush injuries due to stampedes, fires, accidents (eg, airplane crashes, motor vehicles, boat collisions, crane collapse), structural failures (eg, building or bridges collapses, terrorist attacks, and toxic exposures) is ever present, and their occurrences are unpredictable. Several mass casualty incidents have occurred between 2015 and 2018 (table; appendix).

For example, during the 2015 Hajj pilgrimage, two major disasters occurred, resulting in deaths of pilgrims (table) . The first occurred on Sept 11, 2015, in which a crane being used for construction to expand the area around the Grand Mosque (Masjid alHaram) in Mecca toppled over, killing 107 people and injuring 394. 31 The victims were from 12 countries. The second, on Sept 24, 2015, was a major stampede that occurred in Mina at the intersection leading up to the Jamaraat Bridge. This incident resulted in crush injuries and suffocation, with 769 pilgrim deaths and 934 injured. 32

Owing to the sudden and unexpected nature of mass casualty incidents, they pose major challenges to health services. Preparations for mass casualty incidents are mandated by the WHO and followed by the organising authorities. When these incidences occur, local investi gations and reviews are done to assess the underlying factors leading to the mass casualty incident, assess the effectiveness of the response, and identify lessons for inclusion in future mass gathering planning. 93, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] Training and simulation exercises for healthcare workers in management of mass casualties and injuries should be done to assess preparedness and identify areas for improvement.

A 30year literature review 100 of 290 mass casualty events at mass gatherings showed that the most frequent mechanism of injury involved the movement of people under crowded conditions (162 [56%] of 290). Organisers of the Kumbh Mela and Hajj have used experiences of their mass casualty incidents to identify improvements to reduce risk at future events (appendix).

The Saudi Arabian Government has also put in place measure to reduce mordbidity and mortality from heat related disorders during the Hajj, as has the Japanese Government for the upcoming Olympics (appendix). mandatory and optional vaccines for prevention of infections are issued by local public health authorities and WHO. Occasionally authorities in countries of origin face hurdles in the implementation of these measures 87, 108 or issues regarding reduced immunogenicity of vaccines owing to interactions between vaccines. 109 Although no global outbreaks of meningococcal disease have occurred after the Hajj for decades, a high level of awareness of the possibility of outbreaks at all mass gatherings remains. 87, [110] [111] [112] Increasingly, attention is being focused on vaccinepreventable diseases, such as cholera, polio, measles, and pertussis, which are increasing in the eastern Mediterranean owing to conflict and large refugee populations with poor access to preventive public health services. 113 The highly lethal MERSCoV causes increasing concern, as it continues to circulate in Saudi Arabia 78, 79 and remains in the top ten of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint list of infectious diseases likely to cause major epidemics (appendix). 112

More countryspecific religious mass gathering events exist that attract smaller numbers of pilgrims from neighbouring countries or overseas. Several religious mass gatherings occur on a yearly basis in Iraq, drawing millions of pilgrims from across the country. The Arbaeen is one of the largest, during which pilgrims from Iraqi provinces visit the holy shrine in Karbala, and poses major public health challenges. 114 In West Africa, each year up to 5 million Muslim pilgrims from the Mouride community in Senegal, and from neighbouring countries, assemble in the holy city of Touba in Senegal for the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage, 115 the largest religious mass gathering in West Africa. This pilgrimage attracts individuals from outside Africa and has the potential for globalisation of local endemic infectious diseases. 115 Research on communicable diseases and non communicable diseases, including heatrelated disorders and disasters, with a more collaborative approach between local and international researchers and organisers of mass gathering events is required. The creation of the Africa Centres for Diseases Control (Africa CDC) on Jan 31, 2017, in Addis Ababa by the African Union, with five regional CDCs in Gabon, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Zambia, 116 creates major opportunities for improving coordination and public health capacitybuilding initiatives in partner ship with organisers of sporting and religious mass gathering events. For example, the majority of the live stock for ritual sacrifices during the Hajj are exported from Africa to the Middle East-the One Human EnvironmentalAnimal Health approach 101, 117, 118 should be adopted in partnership with Africa CDC. This initiative should aim to define the risk and threats to global health security and help reduce the risk of outbreaks and spread of zoonotic infections, such as Rift Valley fever, MERS CoV, Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, across Mass gathering events provide unique opportunities for crosscontinental multidisciplinary collaborations on public health and basic science research, which will allow for the development of a strong evidence base for public health planning and health services at mass gatherings (panel 5). Although the formalisation of mass gatherings medicine has led to an increase in research studies into the specific health issues affecting pilgrims at the Hajj, they have not been forthcoming for the Kumbh Mela and other mass gatherings. Research output from mass gathering events is focused on small studies of pilgrims from individual countries and the data are not generalisable and no outputs have changed global policy. A need remains for more coordinated action by a global coalition of interested partners to share experiences from various mass gathering events, gather and translate appropriate evidence base into public health policy, and push for the best health promotion and educational policies. The creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or formal network, with a dedicated journal, might generate more frequent dialogue and enhance international collaborations on mass gathering medicine. A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review. Advances in technology and closer monitoring of pilgrims at the Hajj provide an opportunity for large cohort studies of attendees of mass gathering events. These studies could focus on infectious diseases priorities, inc luding neglected tropical diseases, 119 noncom municable diseases, mental health, and heatrelated disorders (panels 4 and 5). The widespread availability of next generation sequencing, genotyping and phenotyping, and other molecular methods also provides an opportunity for analyses of health risks among large population cohorts and for appropriate research to obtain an evidence base for the production of WHOapproved guidelines, which will be useful for countries that host mass gathering events.

Structured, realtime interoperable surveillance and reporting systems are required for active surveillance of communicable and noncommunicable diseases during mass gatherings. 120 Given the continuing threat of new emerging and reemerging infectious diseases with epidemic potential, regularly recurring mass gathering events, can act as important global sentinel surveillance platforms. 120 Additionally, diseases targeted by WHO for elimination, such as polio, are still endemic in some countries from where individuals attending mass gathering events originate, offering opportunities for research and evalu ation of public health portfolios. 121 Increased investments in the field of mass gathering medicine are required to obtain an accurate evidence base for the development of accurate prevention, management, and control guide lines and optimal public health services to protect the health of attendees of mass gatherings and of host country populations.

Mass Gatherings and Public Health: Case Studies from the Hajj to Mecca,"B A C K G R O U N D Many new and challenging risks can be introduced during mass gatherings. The Hajj, as one of the largest mass gatherings, provides an excellent annual opportunity to reflect on the public health risk posed by international and multicultural crowds and the value of mitigation strategies.","The World Health Organization describes a mass gathering as ""An organized or unplanned event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event,"" whereas the US-based National Association of Emergency Medical Service Physicians defines it as ""Spectators and participants at events in which at least 1000 persons are gathered at a specific location for a defined period of time."" 1 The Hajj, one of the world's largest mass gatherings, takes annually place in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. 2 In 2015, approximately 2.8 million Muslims from more than 183 countries visited this holy place for 5 days of rituals compulsory for all Muslims capable of undertaking the journey. 3 This challenge to the country perhaps is no less than organizing an Olympic every year. Saudi Arabia, being the custodian of the 2 holy cities (Mecca and Medina), provides extensive, multifaceted programs to serve these ""Guests of God."" However, the annual event is confronted with public health challenges besides immigration, crowd, and crime management. In addition to the formidable logistics, the risk for spread of infectious diseases is well recognized in the era of globalization. Contemporary outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus have drawn much attention to global health. The annual Hajj event definitely calls for precautions. This paper is informed by a review of the literature and case studies among 2015 Hajj pilgrims.

Infectious Diseases. The 5-day ritual causes extensive physical and mental stresses. Heat, sun exposure, thirst, crowding, traffic congestions, steep inclines, rough terrain, and cultural diversity present extensive stressors. During Hajj, pilgrims are also challenged by various prevention and infection control measures. Weather conditions, along with overcrowding within a confined area, make pilgrims also more susceptible to acquiring and spreading infections, particularly acute respiratory infections. 4 These major challenges have been witnessed when outbreaks of epidemics have occurred; for example, outbreaks of plague and cholera in ancient times involved large numbers of pilgrims, when quarantine was the prime means of control 5,6 ; a global meningococcal serotype W135 outbreak in 2000 was widely linked to either a recent return from the Hajj or contact with returned pilgrims 2,7 ; in recent years notable threats were avian influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 8, 9 In 2012, the Hajj received political and scientific attention when MERS cases were detected in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient who died of a severe respiratory illness in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 8 According to Bakhsh et al, 10 in 2 health care centers near the Holy Mosque, most of the patients were suffering from respiratory problems followed by skin and gastrointestinal problems during the 2013 Hajj season. ""Hajj cough"" was considered by pilgrims the most reported complaint, and 1 in 3 pilgrims were found to be affected. The severity and clinical spectrum of respiratory disease varies from mild sickness to severe pneumonia, hospitalization, and even death. 11 Unfortunately there are no comprehensive studies on the epidemiology of respiratory infections during Hajj; most investigations involved cross-sectional studies on a relatively small number of cases. 12, 13 Although governments of Hajji's countries of origin recommend flu vaccinations for Hajj pilgrimages before departure, most hajjis do not adhere to these recommendations. Influenza vaccine has been recommended since 2005 for all pilgrims, especially people at high risk, which includes those >65 years of age and people with preexisting medical or immune-compromising conditions. 14 Despite all these recommendations, the influenza vaccine acceptance rate among Hajj pilgrims varies by country and by year. Many pilgrims refuse vaccines; the main reasons identified were reliance on ""natural immunity,"" lack of awareness or knowledge, and lack of access to vaccines. Many people have misperceptions about vaccines, including that they contain toxic preservatives and are themselves the cause of disease. Moreover these vaccinations do not cover variants of different strains of influenza. According to Alborzi et al., 13 in their study on Iranian Hajj pilgrims, influenza vaccination could not prevent respiratory infections in pilgrims statistically (P Â¼ . 19 ), but the consequences of this limitation remains less. Two hundred fifty-five pilgrims were examined for respiratory infections, and influenza virus was identified more in unvaccinated than in vaccinated pilgrims (16.5% vs 9.2%) in laboratory tests of their nasal swabs. 13 Another study among Malaysian pilgrims found that influenza vaccine was effective for 50%-60% in preventing hospitalization and pneumonia; it was 80% effective in preventing death in patients older than age 60. 15 Eventual vaccination failures might be explained by a new drift of variants or inappropriate vaccine handling and storage. * Therefore examining the circulating influenza strains is recommended in * For men, the special outfit for the hajj consists of 2 pieces of white, unsown cloth. One of the pieces is wrapped around the midriff to cover the lower body, and the other is draped around the shoulders to cover the upper body. Women must cover their bodies in a loose-fitting outfit and cover their hair. However, they are not permitted to cover their faces. addition to strict enforcement of vaccination policy. 13, 15 Among other precautionary measures, the use of a face mask is considered by some pilgrims religiously prohibited while wearing ihram. Some consider using alcohol-containing products (eg, hand sanitizers) as prohibited during Hajj ritual too, although recently religious scholars have allowed the use of alcohol for medical purposes. However, the challenge remains to endorse use of mandatory face masks in the crowd and organize screening at arrival. 9 The Saudi government faces extreme pressure during the time of Hajj because there are multiple routes of entry for pilgrims. 16 Therefore it is recommended to enforce the law on compulsory vaccinations and control for dishonesty and corruption by the home countries as prerequisites for visa processing. Also, a supply of adequate vaccines at limited or no cost is strongly suggested. 14 Skin infections among pilgrims are very common because of lengthy rituals of standing and walking, heat, and unfavorable conditions. 17 Primary pyoderma (including impetigo), carbuncles, furuncles, folliculitis, pyoderma complicated eczema, and cutaneous leishmaniosis are commonly found. Pilgrims are barefoot while walking in some holy places, or emotionally climb some rocky places. Accidental injury, severe burns, and soreness of the sole are common occurances, 18 and these kinds of injuries increase the chance of secondary skin infections, especially among elderly and comorbid people. Noncommunicable Diseases. Many studies and the Saudi Arabian government's health statistics have indicated that noncommunicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, pose critical health challenges for pilgrims and the government's health system during Hajj. [19] [20] [21] Pre-hajj medical states, being of old age, rigorous physical activities, exhaustion, fatigue, heat, and trauma are related to and cause exacerbation of chronic noncommunicable diseases during Hajj. 19, 22, 23 Cardiovascular diseases were the main cause of hospitalization and intensive care. Almalki 24 reported in his Hajj study that out of 110 inpatients from 20 different countries, 34% had ischemic heart disease, 20% had elevated blood pressure, and prevalence of stroke was 17%. According to Madani et al, 19 more than 60% of the intensive care unit admissions in 7 hospitals in Mina and Arafat were due to cardiovascular origins. Among these cases, myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure were of the highest occurrence. 19 Furthermore, cardiovascular events were the major cause of death during pilgrimage. The review study of Al Shimemeri 25 confirmed that cardiovascular diseases during the Hajj period caused more death than other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. In 2008, 66% of deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases out of 446 deaths among Indonesian pilgrims. 26 Many factors been identified that lead to poor diabetes control during Hajj. 27 A study by Khan et al 21 revealed that 31.9% of 689 emergency patients had diabetes; meanwhile 34 patients were diabetic among 160 acutely hospitalized patients.

Mortazavi et al 28 observed that in the 2012 Hajj, 106 Iranian patients were referred back to Iran for health reasons. Among them were 13 cardiac, 28 psychiatric, 11 neurologic, 4 endocrine, and 4 nephrology patients. 28 Crowd Safety. Crowd management requires enormous skills, experience, and efficiency. Research on crowd psychology has been going on since at least Gustave Le Bon's work in the 1890s, and more advanced techniques and models have been used by the entire world during the last 20 years. 29 Hajj is one of the most crowded gatherings of all, and it is expected that the number of pilgrims will increase by 10% each year. Furthermore, most of the pilgrims are from underprivileged countries and are elderly, poor, and illiterate, and the Hajj is often their first international trip. 2, 16 The major concern of this mass gathering is that the entire Hajj event must be completed over a limited and fixed schedule of only 5 days. The rituals are performed in a specific unchangeable sequence following a fixed route within a geographic area that does not exceed 4 km 2 . 16 Such rigor and strictness leads to a series of disasters almost every year, keeping pressure on the authorities.

The Holy Mosque covers an area of 356,800 m 2 , including the outdoor and indoor prayer spaces. Its total capacity is about 2 million people. When fully occupied, the buildings could accommodate an average crowd density level of 4 people per square meter (4 ppm 2 ). However, at certain locations, and closer to the Kaaba, the level of density becomes 6-8 ppm 2 and 12 ppm 2 . A similar crowd density is observed near Jamarat, and incidences like stampedes occur commonly. 30 The Saudi government has involved religious scholars, administrators, immigration and security personnel, health officials, and other officials to Three stone pillars that are pelted as a compulsory ritual of hajj in imitation of the Prophet Abraham (Peace on Him). manage the Hajj. In spite of all these efforts, several disasters have taken place every year, such as stampedes, fires, bottlenecks, and more. Although during the past few years several scientific and technological efforts have been applied to assist in the management of crowds, in 2015 a devastating stampede occurred. The use of crowd simulation models, assessment of the efficient ways of grouping and scheduling pilgrims, luggage management, video monitoring, and changes in the transport system are the latest measures to improve the management of the pilgrimage event. 31 There are many methods for modeling and simulating pedestrian crowds followed worldwide, such as agent based, social force, cellular automata, fluid dynamic, fixed GPA monitoring and queuing models, and so on. Pedestrian crowd dynamics have different scales, such as the microscopic scale, dealing with individual pedestrians, and the macroscopic scale, dealing with the characteristics of a crowd. These methods have shown several self-organizing principles about the patterns of crowd phenomena; corresponding patterns have been noted in real crowds. These included macroscopic crowd patterns that result from local interactions of multitudes of pedestrians at the microscopic level. 29 Some studies reported that people moving in groups had positive psychological effects, including less feeling of being lost, and that proper guidance from a group leader had a positive effect as well. 30 In absence of these factors, real crowds are perceived to pose a threat. However, updates on the crowd flow must be announced and displayed by electronic boards at different parts of the roads to assist in crowd management. Heat-Related Sickness. The ambient temperature in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains very high, particularly during summer. Even during winter, the temperature is higher than in many parts of the world. Weather during Hajj season shows extreme variations, with average temperatures >38 C during daytime and >25 C at night and a monthly rainfall averaging 3 mm. 4 The heat island effectdthat is, heat radiance from vehicles, highrise buildings, pitched roads, ongoing construction, dust particles, and noisedis a recent concern in both Mecca and Medina.

The pilgrims come from different countries worldwide, and their acclimatization to the local temperature is equally diverse. Therefore, exhaustion syndromes may or may not be accompanied by increased body temperature. With a body temperature of 40.0 C (105 F), one person may be able to walk to a clinic for help, whereas another person might die after heat stroke. Moreover, supplicating pilgrims remain unware of the extreme heat exposure until symptoms are noticeable. Addressing the diagnostic criteria of heat stroke thus remains challenging for Hajj pilgrims. 32 Although water mist sprayers are operated in the desert of Arafat, those places remain highly crowded. However, there are various measures that can be applied in performing rituals (eg, using an umbrella, applying sunblock creams, performing rituals at night). 17 

Objectives. This paper describes gaps between preexposure preparation to the mass gathering and postexposure experiences, as well as the disparities between expectations and the reality of the holy place.

We collected 4 case studies by using a semistructured questionnaire facilitating in-depth interviews among Hajjis who were purposively selected from Bangladesh, Myanmar, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Participants were selected following critical case sampling method. Questions covered pre-exposure preparations and postexposure experiences, as well as health and safety concerns. Interviews were audio-recorded in the interviewees' own languages and transcripts translated into English. Case Studies. Pakistan. A 60-year-old retired government officer of the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan and electrical engineer went to perform Hajj by government quota with his family and friends. He and his group were vaccinated against polio, influenza, and meningitis 1 week before departure, and vaccination cards were provided along with visas.

On arrival at Jeddah International Airport at Dhur prayer, they had to wait 3 hours for transportation to Mecca. Accommodation was arranged at Mecca 16 km from the Holy Mosque. However, rooms were overcrowded and lacked proper ventilation. Washing machines at a laundry area were provided, and although pilgrims were guided to dry their clothes on the top roof of the hotel building, many pilgrims dried their clothes inside the rooms. Medical facilities and food supply and delivery were inadequately available and not properly managed in the vicinity of the accommodation in Mecca, but in Medina, they were managed properly. The transport system was not properly arranged either. The respondent and his group had to change 2 buses with pilgrims from various other nationalities to reach haram 5 times a day. To avoid this hassle, they tried to spend most of time inside the haram. There was a lack of enforcement on the use of mataf. z Although there were different mataf areas for wheelchair users, people tried to conduct circumambulation with wheelchairs in the same mataf area, and as a result, many accidents happened. A couple from their group witnessed a crane crash accident in haram, but they survived. The pilgrimage route between Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah, presented in Figure 1 , posed multiple challenges for pilgrims. The respondent, with his family, had to stay inside a heat-resistant cloth tent for 5 days in Mina. However, tents in Mina had few cooling facilities and were overcrowded. The temperature in Arafat was around 55 C, and they had to stay in open tents without any cooling system. They spent the night in Muzdalifah in an open space; however, the place was overcrowded and untidy. Sanitation was available with sufficient facilities, but cleanliness was not well managed; there was garbage and litter all around. Transportations were overcrowded with poor safety arrangements; many got injured while boarding. Because all Hajj rituals had to be performed at specific times and places and all pilgrims wanted to complete the pilgrimage route as early as possible, there was obvious struggle among all. Many pilgrims traveled long routes on foot. In Mina, many pilgrims experienced heat stroke, and many were killed in a stampede at Jamarat during the stoning of Satan. The respondent thinks extreme hot weather, overcrowding, language barriers, and challenged pilgrimage management made the Hajj difficult.

Myanmar. A 30-year-old medical doctor performed his fourth Hajj from Myanmar in 2015. He went as a medical officer recruited by a hajj service company. He prepared medicines and medical requirements for more than 600 pilgrims. He gave a 15-minute health session to them during a dinner gathering hosted by the company. The session was too short to cover all health-related matters. Despite mandatory cholera and meningococcal vaccinations for visa application, nearly all Hajj agents including his company provided fake vaccination certificates. He led a 120-pilgrim group to Mecca. The hotels at Mecca were next to Kaaba and were well furnished, but rooms were overcrowded by sneaking in extra beds. In case of emergency such as a fire outbreak, people might get into trouble. Moreover, the condition contributed to increased risk of transmission of airborne diseases. For many pilgrims, the visit was their first international trip and they had never experienced such a huge gathering of people before.

In the Kaaba compound, many tower cranes were assembled at the time of the pilgrimage. Although the crane operations were temporarily shut down, pilgrims were worried about the hazard of cranes after a crane accident occurred earlier. Squeezed into a corner of the holy black stone, with vigorous pushes and wild rushes, was a dangerous place for the old, the sick, and children. Surprisingly, there were some hazardous places like collapsed billboards and unhygienic out-of-order public toilets in walking distance from the holiest mosque. The holy city's waste management was very good, yet sorrowfully, many pilgrims did not care about being at holy places and they littered carelessly in public places.

At Mina, the camps and toilets were very crowded. At Arafat, camps were also crowded and there was no electricity supply. The camp had a mud floor. The weather was too hot on the day of Arafat. Thus, people suffered from heat exhaustion, back pain, and exacerbation of hypertension. Leaving to Muzdalifah, routes were heavily crowded by pilgrim pedestrians. This posed a potential challenge causing delay for the emergency medical teams to reach patients. Although security squads were deployed, their number became significantly increased only after the devastated stampede at Jamarat.

In Medina, the conditions were relatively comfortable in all aspects, particularly good accommodation and fewer crowds. One very dangerous attempt of pilgrims during visiting Islamic historic sites was climbing steep sides of the Hira Cave Â§ wall, eager to reach the cave, and once inside pushing to perform supererogatory prayers.

Bangladesh. A 36-year-old young government officer of Bangladesh Army's engineering core said that his group didn't receive any vaccinations because their visas were done with fake vaccination cards. Yet they arranged meningitis vaccines by themselves on the advice of experienced persons. The accommodations at Mecca and Medina were not up to their expectations and the deposit they provided to the agency. The rooms were tiny and overcrowded, with no or minimal ventilation. No arrangement for drying wet clothes made the room damp and unhygienic. The building had no elevator and no emergency exit. The electric cables and wirings had no secure fittings, posing an increased risk of short circuit. Littering on the road was found beyond limitations. For the reasons of convenience and avoiding various challenges, the respondent spent most of the time inside the Holy Mosque, and thus he witnessed the most tragic accident of a crane collapsing. Being an army officer, he was better equipped to cope with casualties and volunteered to assist the injured. He found many warning signs stating ""Construction Site, Do Not Sit"" inside the mosque, but enforcement of those warnings was lacking. Escalators were used by elderly in wheelchairs besides pedestrians. Because of overcrowding and neglect of regulations, he witnessed the fall of one old person rolling down with his wheelchair. There were different and tidy arrangements for circumambulation of wheelchair holders, but many pedestrians used the same circle in front of law enforcers. The front wheel of wheelchairs thus hurt the backs of the ankles (Achilles tendons) of many pilgrims.

From the respondent's perspective, Mina and Arafat were the most mismanaged places. Pilgrims from developing countries were assigned to stay in overcrowded tents with a low-capacity air cooler. In Arafat, the tents were open without any cooling facilities. One of their groupmates died from heat stroke.

New Zealand. A New Zealand pilgrim went to Hajj alone with an agency. According to the respondent, vaccination and doctor's certificate were mandatory for visa approval. The agency didn't provide any health training or Hajj-ritual education. On arrival in Mecca, accommodation and transportation were facilitated in a well-organized manner. They were provided a 5-star hotel in the vicinity of the Holy Mosque, both in Mecca and Medinah. Even in Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah they were provided air-conditioned tents with clean-hygiene sanitary facilities, although he was of the opinion that it could have been improved. A doctor visited their tents and provided medicines. In his language, the ""NZ-AUS Hajj camp was of superior quality. I went for Hajj for spiritual purpose. If someone remains calm, the spiritual side can be felt by overcoming worldly limitations.""

In short, our study clearly revealed dissatisfaction and discontentment regarding the management among Hajj pilgrims from developing countries. This sacred ritual was hijacked as a business opportunity by broker agencies of developing countries, infested with corruption, dishonesty, and greed to make profit from pilgrims. Implementation and enforcement of law from both the custodian country and sending countries were found to be weak in several aspects. Notwithstanding the custodian country's adoption of various recent research insights, techniques, and models to enhance security and safety, and arrangement of relevant annual conferences and capacity-building initiatives, a significant gap was found between planned and actual implementation strategies. A discriminatory and judgmental attitude of the custodian country officials was encountered toward pilgrims from developing countries.

Case studies adopt a retrospective approach; therefore, a potential recall bias among respondents should be considered. We also acknowledge the limitations of a purposive sampling that may enhance the risk for selection bias. Interanalyst reliability testing was employed to minimize potential bias in the analysis. In the absence of post-travel surveillance in respondents' home countries, follow-up on the post-travel period except about their own was not feasible. The value of our study Â§ The place where Muhammad PBUH is believed to have received the first revelation of the Qura'n.

is that it gave a voice to Hajj pilgrims themselves and offers a benchmark in revealing practices that undermine health and safety of pilgrims from developing countries.

Although Saudi Arabia keeps pilgrims' health and safety as their top priority, inevitably causalities do happen. Many recent incidences and risks of morbidity and mortality suggest that it is not the sole responsibility of one country but should be attributed to all home countries of pilgrims. Especially to meet the challenge of infectious diseases, a well-coordinated global approach is priority. Epidemiological modeling at the microscopic level is suggested by many researchers and already monitored in other mass gatherings, such as Notting Hill Carnival. Dishonesty related to vaccination and treatment ultimately endangers the whole world as illustrated in the literature. Henceforth international collaboration, law enforcement, and research are vital to ensure accessibility of vaccines and prescribed medications for the pilgrims. Capacity building within host and sending countries focusing on prevention of infectious disease, heat-related sicknesses, and injuries before Hajj are important and should be adopted worldwide. Hajj causalities data should be shared accurately; and the custodian country should welcome global participation and deal with criticism in a constructive way. Furthermore, an international event of this magnitude such as the Hajj creates communication challenges. To minimize language barriers, law enforcers must be proficient in English, and written instructions or directions should make use of main global languages. 29 Hajj is a unique mass gathering provides excellent is annual opportunity to reflect on the public health risk posed by international and multicultural crowds and the value of mitigation strategies. New and challenging risks can be introduced during mass gatherings. From a global health and human security perspective, strengthening of core capacities in managing mass gatherings and researching risks posed by such gatherings are paramount to safeguarding the public's health.

Mass Gatherings Health 6 Research agenda for mass gatherings: a call to action,Public health research is essential for the development of eff ective policies and planning to address health security and risks associated with mass gatherings (MGs). Crucial research topics related to MGs and their eff ects on global health security are discussed in this review. The research agenda for MGs consists of a framework of fi ve major public health research directions that address issues related to reducing the risk of public health emergencies during MGs; restricting the occurrence of non-communicable and communicable diseases; minimisation of the eff ect of public health events associated with MGs; optimisation of the medical services and treatment of diseases during MGs; and development and application of modern public health measures. Implementation of the proposed research topics would be expected to provide benefi ts over the medium to long term in planning for MGs.,"A mass gathering (MG), as defi ned by WHO, is ""any occasion, either organized or spontaneous, that attracts suffi cient numbers of people to strain the planning and response resources of the community, city or nation hosting the event"". 1 MGs can be spontaneous or organised and include sports events, social or cultural functions, gatherings of displaced populations due to natural disasters or war, and political or religious congregations. [2] [3] [4] [5] Major MGs are likely to involve communities from diff erent parts of the world. Participants and host and home communities face health risks that are of international concern. Therefore, the control of infectious diseases and provision of medical services for non-communicable dis eases and other risks to health are increasingly important in the planning for MGs. Risks commonly associated with MGs include health systems having to accom modate a surge in capacity; challenges to existing health interventions; introduction and transmission of non-endemic diseases during and after MGs; diffi culties associated with risk communication to participants from diff erent cultures; and those arising because of the high profi le of some events, such as security risks.

International MGs can amplify the transmission of infectious diseases, and infections can spread from the home to the host community during travel to and from the event and from the host to the home community on return. 6 Such events can pose substantial risks to global health security and present challenges for surveillance of the spread of such diseases to new ecological settings and vulnerable populations. 7 In addition to risks of infectious diseases during MGs, non-communicable risks include cardiovascular diseases, environment-related heat injury, fi re-related injury, illnesses related to use of drugs and alcohol, occupational injuries, trauma or crush injuries associated with stampedes, exacerbation of respiratory diseases, and crowd safety. 8 Large MGs can also provide opportunities for terrorist activities.

In planning for MGs, international and local health authorities need to ensure that the strengthened public health systems and rapid responses to health risks are integrated with other important components of the overall event management. Eff ective public health policy should be based on evidence.

The organisation of international MGs generally requires provision of huge amounts of resources by the host country and the dividend of such high visibility is called legacy. This legacy should be measured not just in terms of absolute improvements (eg, new roads and ambulances) but also in terms of improvements to the public health system and society as a whole. For example, the legacies of strengthened integration of clinical or laboratory services, early warning or syndromic surveillance, and fi eld epidemiology or response adopted for the past summer Olympics (Sydney, Australia, Athens, Greece, and Beijing, China) [9] [10] [11] are used routinely in the health systems.

The development of eff ective methods for, and improvement of, planning and handling of the health risks associated with MGs will strengthen global health security, prevent excessive emergency health problems and associated economic loss, and mitigate potential societal disruption in host and home communities. Such development requires credible evidence to support activities that can reduce the global eff ect of infectious diseases and address local public health issues related to morbidity and mortality resulting from noncommunicable diseases during MGs. However, there are gaps in knowledge about many public health issues that contribute to eff ective planning. 6, 12, 13 Therefore, a robust knowledge about illnesses, from basic scientifi c understanding to societal eff ects of infections and noncommunicable diseases, is essential for modern public health practices and policy development related to the planning for MGs.

Several reports [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and WHO planning and guidance documents 1,16-18 have drawn attention to the importance Series of research into public health issues associated with MGs and identifi ed those that need immediate attention. Despite these eff orts, an overarching research agenda based on public health to address the gaps in knowledge in MG health has not yet been developed. Moreover, international coordination to prioritise and enable the funding and implementation of such an agenda has been lacking. The recent recognition and rapid development of MG health can provide focus on such issues.

Previously identifi ed research priorities for MGs tended to focus on logistical issues relating to site security and emergency management, crowd control, and surge in the need for medical services. 12, 13 Other specialties tend to focus on each of the specifi c public health topics that are associated with MGs. Much research into existing and emerging infectious diseases is devoted to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, surveillance and response, and treatment and vaccines. Although a research agenda based on public health must be underpinned by basic science, applied science and operational research are areas of particular interest to the organisers of MGs and the decision makers for public health, especially those in poorly resourced countries. The modern day idea of MG health has developed from the notion that ""mass gatherings medicine is concerned with the provision of emergency medical care at organized events with >1000 people in attendance"" 18 to include several specialties (fi gure). The intricate interactions between the diff erent specialties is essential for the planning and success of MGs. New advances or interventions undertaken in other specialties should be integrated with research into MGs.

The proposed research agenda is a broad strategy for research into public health, with a focus on issues related to MGs. It is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of all possible research questions about the strategic planning for and operation of MGs. Instead the agenda is an outline of key research into methods to control public health and policy. The results of this research can provide an evidence-based platform for policy decisions and practices to reduce the risks and eff ects of MG-associated health issues and global security risks to public health.

The principal objectives of this research agenda are to identify topics for research and underpin and prioritise their importance in achieving interventions for the control of public health; provide a research framework to gather evidence to address health issues associated with MGs and global security risks to public health; ensure focus on less well addressed issues such as operational and implementation research, particularly for under-resourced regions; provide a platform to enable co ordination, discussion, and interaction among organisers of MGs, public health professionals, and researchers; and encourage a multidisciplinary approach to address gaps in knowledge about health risks associated with MGs and their control.

The proposed research agenda is organised as a framework of fi ve major public health research directions.

Although many public health emergencies associated with MGs are not predictable, much can be done to prevent and minimise their eff ects. Continuous monitoring of participants' vulnerability to health risks at MGs and understanding trends in risks that are associated with specifi c events (religious, sports, or concerts) can be used to predict what might happen in the future. They are also essential for successful preparedness and management of risk reduction and strengthening the response capacity of host and home communities. Recognition and analysis of the changing risks and vulnerabilities during MGs are starting points for raising awareness and communication of pending risks. Building global capacity for health intelligence for noncommunicable and infectious diseases is important for the elucidation of the risks associated with MGs. Most of this information is available through networks such as the emerging infectious disease networks 19, 20 and the WHO Global Non communicable Disease Network. 21 Importantly, the information can be used to implement strategies for risk assessment and mitigation in planning for specifi c MGs (panels 1, 2). 

Morbidity and mortality at MGs can be mitigated through the assessment and management of risks associated with pre-existing non-communicable diseases. Mitigation methods such as the provision of essential drugs and information about their availability at the MG can be initiated during pretravel medical care and advice. 5, 26 Incidence of trauma and heat-related illness at a site can be reduced with the provision of advice and installations to combat the eff ects of weather, and eff ective crowd control. 5 Models for the prediction of the spread of infections and occurrence of other emergency health issues during MGs have yet to be validated. 7 Many of the diffi culties in restricting the spread of emerging communicable diseases [6] [7] [8] 23 are not new and have proven diffi cult to resolve. There is also uncertainty 

Global clinical and laboratory surveillance systems for communicable diseases, such as those for seasonal and pandemic infl uenza, 22 are well established. The establishment of country-level surveillance systems for infectious diseases that can be adapted to diff erent epidemiological settings for mass gatherings (MGs) could also provide alerts for the occurrence of non-communicable diseases, such as radiation-related or chemical-related illnesses or those caused by extreme environmental temperatures (eg, Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases). 23 An important component of the alert and response strategy is an integrated event management system that provides a platform for rapid dissemination of devices and procedures required for the management of health risks. Research into their development and implementation is needed. Syndromic surveillance can potentially provide rapid initial information about the occurrence of both non-communicable and infectious diseases. However, its establishment and assessment of eff ectiveness during MGs might require further assessment. Further work is also needed to identify appropriate parameters for assessment of the eff ectiveness of such surveillance systems during MGs.

Surveillance of non-communicable diseases is a formidable but necessary step for the improvement of the health of the global community. An estimated 63% of global mortality in 2008 was attributable to non-communicable diseases and 80% of such deaths occurred in low-income and middle-income countries. 24 Age-specifi c and sex-specifi c profi les of non-communicable diseases by country 25 allow host countries of MGs to estimate possible risks of non-communicable diseases in participants from specifi c countries and plan for mitigation strategies.

Although the challenges for the organisers of MGs and the eff ects of infectious diseases at such events have been summarised, 6, 14 there are many gaps in our understanding of emerging communicable diseases. Integration of information from local and international surveillance of infectious diseases is important for strengthening the intelligence about the global threats before, during, and after MGs. 23

The risks of non-communicable and infectious diseases during MGs are proportional to the probability of occurrence of risk factors during the event. The identifi cation of these risks factors for the diff erent types of MGs will provide a scientifi c basis for planning eff ective prevention. Although major risk factors associated with non-communicable and communicable diseases are likely to be similar worldwide, factors specifi c to the type of MG might lead to health problems. Systematic risk assessment helps identify potential risks of outbreaks and guides the establishment of eff ective risk management solutions. Systematic assessment will also identify potential or deliberate health security risks that require assistance from other authorities and government agencies.

The leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identifi cation of such risks allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. Provision of shaded areas can reduce the incidence of heat-related illnesses and eff ective crowd control reduces the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identifi ed as health risks for other types of MGs; 26 therefore, restriction of their use can mitigate the associated illnesses. The types and magnitude of health risks associated with spontaneous MGs due to natural disasters and confl icts are diff erent from those of organised MGs. Objectives for risk management at such events are focused on facility-based health-care provision in addition to prevention.

The potential for importation and subsequent global spread of infectious diseases during MGs are well understood. Many emerging human infections are recognised as zoonotic diseases (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], infl uenza A H5N1, Nipah virus infection). The emergence of novel or rare pathogens in home communities and their subsequent spread to the host community and beyond can be amplifi ed during MGs.

Planning for the potential risks and hazards that are associated with MGs is essential to ensure success. Many reports and manuals are available for planning MGs; 1,27-32 however, their use should be tempered by the results of the risk assessment. Importantly, planning should maximise the legacy of the MG. The conceptual model of a lasting public health legacy as a framework for the relation between planning inputs, implementation, and public health outcomes was put forward by WHO and the International Olympic Committee to ensure sustainable, positive health eff ects for the host communities after the Olympic Games. 11 Legacy planning should also include passing the knowledge gained to future hosts of similar MGs.

Series about how observations pertaining to particular pathogens, population groups, or settings can be used to develop public health policies for planning diff erent types of MGs. The development of evidence-based strategies for non-pharmaceutical inter ventions is urgently needed to address infection control and mitigate spread in the absence of available drugs and vaccines. Additionally, such strategies are of particular concern for countries that do not have adequate access to pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. In some instances, available data for planning MGs might not have been assimilated in the best way for policy. A balance between basic scientifi c research and operational research is essential to inform the implementation of prevention strategies, best practices, and public health decision making (panel 3). Research into how to contain the spread of infectious diseases should have the broadest possible applicability in diff erent settings and at diff erent resource levels. However, some results might not be generalisable to the planning for MGs, such as those from studies of pathogen transmission in health-care settings.

Eff ective management of health risks for noncommunicable and infectious diseases during MGs requires planning in advance. It is an integral part of planning that consists of risk identifi cation, communication, analysis, assessment, prevention, and monitoring. 23, 28, 29 Many of the processes for risk management of non-communicable and infectious diseases during MGs are common. However, each can be specifi c to the type of MG and needs to be addressed accordingly. 8, 26 High visibility of MGs complicates risk management and can lead to political and media pressure and thereby aff ect the decision-making process.

Prevention of the occurrence of non-communicable and infectious disease at MGs requires coordinated risk assessment and management before, during, and after the event as shown in the planning for the Hajj. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 26 Ideally, the primary prevention of human infections with emerging communicable diseases is the eff ective control of pathogens at their source. Since at-source elimination of all emerging pathogens is not possible, secondary interventions (eg, pharmaceutical or nonpharmaceutical) are needed to mitigate the spread of infection during MGs. However, the eff ectiveness of such interventions has not been established. 33, 34 In addition to reduction of the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with human infections during MGs, reduction of both the circulation of pathogens and human exposure might lessen the global health security risks.

The eff ect of emergencies and crises on health can be substantially reduced if home and host communities are well prepared and are able to reduce their risks. The main challenge during MGs is the existence of systematic operative capacities such as risk assessment plans, coordinating mechanisms and standard procedures, institutional capacities, legislation and budgets, skilled Vaccination is highly eff ective in the prevention of infectious diseases. However, many countries, particularly those with insuffi cient resources, have not developed strategies for vaccinating their populations at risk and people travelling to MGs. The reason is partly related to the lack of information about the transmission of infectious diseases (eg, infl uenza) and the social, economic, and health eff ects to the host and home communities. Public health authorities need to decide how to eff ectively prioritise vaccine use on the basis of available information about disease burden and severity, epidemiology, and vaccine eff ectiveness and safety for vaccine-preventable infections associated with MGs. 6 A failure to promote and implement the polio vaccination programme caused the re-emergence of poliovirus in Nigeria and subsequent international spread, 35,36 emphasising the risks associated with insuffi cient vaccine coverage for participants at MGs. An outbreak of Neisseria meningitides serogroup A (originating from Africa) during the Hajj in 1987 37 was later successfully controlled with the introduction of mandatory pretravel vaccination and use of fl uoroquinolones among African pilgrims. 38 However, there are infectious diseases, including some of the most important and most dangerous, for which there are no vaccines.

Risk assessment and management during the planning for MGs can enable the development of eff ective health policies. Strategic risk assessments are used to gather, coordinate, and analyse data that are necessary to identify existing risks, anticipate potential diffi culties, establish 

â¢ Enhance applications of existing vaccines against possible infectious diseases that are associated with MGs â¢ Assess the global vaccine supply and production to improve the processes of rapid response, surge in capacity, and rapid deployment and tracking of vaccine use for planning MGs â¢ Develop innovative clinical trial methods to study the eff ectiveness and safety of novel vaccines before and after licensing â¢ Develop new vaccines, platforms, and formulations that are safe with enhanced immunogenicity, especially in children and elderly people Series priorities, and provide the basis for enacting targeted policies and implementation of corrective interventions.

A system is needed for the measurement of the eff ect of public health policy and estimation of the probability of success. These interlinking processes are well described for regularly organised events such as the Hajj and Olympic Games. 5, 11, 14 An example of the eff ective development of health policy is the organisation of the Hajj-such as a smoke-free environment for the prevention of fi re, structural changes to prevent crowding, and recommendations for vaccination of pilgrims to prevent transmission of infectious diseases (eg, infl uenza, meningitis, poliomyelitis). 5 However, such eff ective policies are not possible for spontaneous MGs such as population displacement as a result of natural disasters or confl icts.

Development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases presents substantial challenges and can take many years for diseases that are caused by novel pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; panel 4). Even if a vaccine exists, it might need to be regularly updated, clinically assessed for safety and effi cacy, and promptly produced for immediate use (eg, infl uenza vaccines). The effi cacy and eff ectiveness of a vaccine are dependent on the immune responses that are determined by the age of the recipient and composition of the vaccine (eg, conjugated or adjuvanted). Improvements to vaccines and formulations that can provide longer-lasting and broader activity aff ord better protection, increase the applicability of vaccines, and reduce the frequency of vaccination. During an outbreak, the important factors are the rapid production and equitable distribution of vaccines to countries in need.

Ensuring rapid and eff ective management of patients and prevention of diseases requires robust health services at MGs. Providers of emergency services play an important part in ensuring public safety during such events. Knowledge and monitoring of medical service provision during MGs has been rapidly increasing in the past decade. 12, 13, 39 However, a lack of consolidated data for diff erent types of MGs means that organisers are not able to plan accordingly for the emergency medical services that might be needed. Improved and targeted clinical management and infection control can substantially reduce the incidence and transmission of infectious diseases during MGs. Optimum clinical management must be based on an improved under standing of the pathogenesis of these infections, advances in laboratory diagnosis, development and application of eff ective antimicrobial drugs, and other treatment modalities (panel 5).

There are many gaps in our basic understanding of how many of the pathogens that are associated with MGs cause disease in people and what factors aff ect severity of illness. Host immune responses, underlying comorbidity, age, and the properties of the infecting pathogen can all contribute to severity.

The clinical presentation of many infections, such as infl uenza, is not specifi c, which makes diff erential diagnosis and early treatment to reduce further transmission and severe outcomes diffi cult. For example, antibiotics can help control severity and further spread of travellers' diarrhoea caused by bacteria. Rapid and reliable diagnostic testing can expedite the initiation of timely and appropriate treatment and infection control. Increase in and optimisation of the repertoire of antimicrobial drugs immunomodulator drugs, immunoglobulins, and natural products) that are applicable in low-resource areas and in fi eld conditions (such as availability, whether licensed or not, acceptance, and effi cacy in diff erent ethnic, sex, and age groups) and are easy to administer in paediatric-care and emergency-care settings â¢ Optimise management of people who are at risk of severe disease and complications, including emergency-care practices that are applicable across a range of resource settings

Health-care capacity and response â¢ Assess the eff ectiveness of global, national, and local responses to outbreaks of communicable diseases and develop new methods for assessment â¢ Undertake operational studies to investigate the surge capacity needs, particularly in host countries for MGs, including development of triage schemes in diff erent health-care and resource settings, and surge planning to maintain adequate resources â¢ Undertake studies to identify evidence-driven clinical-care pathways and principles that optimise health-care delivery in a range of resource settings â¢ Undertake studies to develop principles and practices for rapid assessment and introduction of new interventions during health emergencies, including systems for collation, sharing, and assessment in real time of clinical data Series and development of clinical research to assess effi cacy of putative adjuvant treatments such as immunomodulator drugs, passive immuno therapy, and traditional medicine that are suitable for use in under-resourced areas would be most benefi cial in the preparation for MGs (panel 5).

The availability and quality of health services contributes to the eff ect of infectious diseases in the source and home countries (panel 5). The same pathogen that might have a small eff ect on the rates of morbidity and mortality in countries with well organised health-care systems can be devastating in countries where health-care systems are suboptimum.

New public health methods need to be harnessed to help reduce the eff ect of health problems during MGs. Use of innovative communication channels, such as the internet and mobile phone networks, have the potential to aid surveillance, rapid risk assessment, and dissemination of accurate information. 23, 40, 41 Mathematical modelling and risk communication have potential applicability in all aspects of research into health risks associated with MGs.

Some countries and MG organisers use state-of-the-art approaches for early detection and monitoring of diseases such as syndromic surveillance. 3, 29 In some countries computerised health-care and laboratory-based infor mation systems are used for planning MGs and these systems can be adapted for monitoring large-scale outbreaks. Other innovative technologies such as mobile phones can be used in remote areas or countries that lack the resources to gather and transmit health-related data in real time, provide rapid feedback, and train health-care workers. 7, 23 Applicability and use of these modern methods of monitoring in diff erent settings and contexts require further investigation, with special attention to issues related to integration and interoperability of initiatives for infection control during MGs (panel 6).

Evidence-based public health decision making in planning and mitigating health risks requires rapid access to information. However, such information is often incomplete, evolving, and derived from an increasingly complex array of sources such as basic science researchers, epidemiologists, social and political scientists, and economists. Modelling is useful in that it can incorporate diverse data to inform public health policy and decision making. 42, 43 Advances in mathematical modelling for public health are expected to include computational structural biology; integration of epidem iological and geographical data into phylogenetic models; within-host and population-level susceptibility models; behavioural modelling; and assessment of the eff ects of climate change on disease transmission and the use of novel datasets on contact patterns and population mobility. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] 

Communication is a key strategy in risk management in planning for MGs. The SARS outbreak in 2003 reinforced the idea that a timely and transparent public information policy could help reduce excessive and inappropriate public health responses and minimise the social disruption and economic consequences of a fast-moving global epidemic. 49, 50 Increased investment in identifying eff ective approaches and developing and assessing new communication methods will benefi t risk prevention and control eff orts. The specifi c challenge is to provide clear, credible, and appropriate communication to meet the needs of diverse communities and retain public trust in a dynamic yet unknown process. 51, 52 Some of the main research topics in this specialty include the link between communication and behaviour change models; development and assessment of methods that can be quickly accessed and used in MGs; and assessment of best practices, challenges, and barriers in risk Research in early detection and monitoring of disease â¢ Identify, develop, and adapt modern technologies for early detection of outbreaks of communicable diseases and their application in disease surveillance during MGs â¢ Integrate and continuously assess innovative approaches and channels for disease surveillance and monitoring â¢ Develop effi cient mechanisms to address the global challenges to sharing information, data, and details about pathogens identifi ed during outbreaks at MGs in terms of local, ethical, legal, and research perspectives â¢ Defi ne the timeliness and quality of data required for early detection of disease from local to district, regional, national, and global levels

â¢ Assess the application of modelling to understand and estimate key parameters for risk management â¢ Investigate the role of modelling to assess eff ect of public health policies for diff erent MGs â¢ Assess modelling in public health policy planning and strategic decision making in MG planning 

Research into health issues related to MGs is at an early stage. Research directions outlined here should contribute to the evidence that can be used to formulate risk management guidelines and assist event planning and health-care policy makers. The research agenda presented here is not intended to be restricted to specifi c aspects of health research but rather to encourage a multidisciplinary approach focused on MG health and to help gain more knowledge. In the future, the focus should be on strategies directed towards developing common research frameworks and defi nitions. Additionally, the knowledge generated by use of the multidisciplinary approach to research ought to be assessed for direct relevance to MGs in terms of their capacity for integration in legacy building and systemic sharing of information.

Considerations for Use of Investigational Drugs in Public Health Emergencies,"The paradigm for the use of investigational drugs in public health emergencies has been recently tested to prevent and treat highly infectious and lethal diseases. Examples include the successful implementation of vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. On the other end of the spectrum was the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of peramivir in the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus that did not provide an opportunity to collect data or understand the effectiveness of the EUA program. Between the gold standard of a randomized controlled clinical trial and the problems associated with EUAs are the domain of expanded access protocols that may provide an avenue to make products available while awaiting licensure. This paper will examine the regulatory pathways in the United States (US) for the use of investigational drugs in a public health emergency as well as considerations when making these products available outside the US. Descriptions of the applications of the various approaches will be presented. Regardless of the pathway chosen, public health and clinical research planners need to work together to consider several factors associated with the respective options and maintain a goal of working toward the collection of data to support licensure before faced with future outbreaks. Finally, this paper will consider the lessons learned from public health response in the context of investigational drugs in other diseases where ""right to try laws"" may pose opportunities, as well as challenges.","Infectious diseases are estimated to have killed more people throughout the history of humans than any other single cause. 1 As air travel continues to grow exponentially, increased exchange of infectious diseases will no doubt accompany the increase in cultural exchange. 2 The recent examples from the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika highlight the limited availability of vaccines and drugs to prevent and treat these threats. Even old threats such as malaria and certain forms of influenza lack effective vaccination solutions.

Further complicating the clinical trial landscape with the EVD outbreak was the lack of limited research infrastructure in West Africa, primarily because of a prolonged recovery from a decades-long civil war in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A logical framework for proceeding in this context proposed by Lane, Marston, and Fauci provided the core principles for conducting clinical research in an outbreak. 3, 4 Those principles are identified in Table 1 . In their paper, they note that definitive studies lead to more rapid licensure, and it is hoped, more rapid distribution of approved vaccines and treatments. During the EVD outbreak in West Africa in 2014 and 2015, the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea invited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to collaborate with researchers in their countries in a program of research that aimed to benefit those countries. The NIAID team was able to collaborate with West African investigators to conduct natural history, preventive vaccine, and therapeutic studies. For example, through engagement with the Ebola response framework in Liberia, research proposals were vetted that included community and scientific input as well as the development of infrastructure to conduct that research. The initial vaccine study concept was vetted through a standing body at the World Health Organization (WHO) and was overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board of international and West African composition. Results from these studies either have been published or are in press. Moreover, the NIAID research program has maintained a presence in West Africa further developing both physical and human clinical research capacity. The NIAID response was focused on the collection of high-quality data in an ethical framework to support answering important questions about investigational vaccines and therapeutics. However, during the Ebola outbreak, there was considerable pressure to use any product available regardless of their unknown risks and benefits.

The 2014-2015 EVD outbreak in West Africa brought an uncomfortable reality to the forefront of clinical research. Is it ethical to conduct a randomized controlled trial when there is no known treatment for a disease with a high mortality, assuming there exists treatment drug candidates with promising preclinical (animal) data?

The WHO convened an advisory panel on August 11, 2014 , to reflect on the ethical considerations regarding the use of investigational drugs to treat EVD. 5 The panel strongly recommended that promising investigational drugs and vaccines for patients with EVD be urgently tested in humans by scientifically sound, rigorous methods. In fact, the panel concluded that researchers have a moral duty to conduct well-designed trials to answer questions regarding safety and efficacy. The panel also recommended that the compassionate use of an investigational product not preclude or delay properly designed clinical studies.

Compassionate use and expanded access protocols often are at odds with the study of the drugs themselves, as expanded access programs are primarily intended to provide treatment, not collect data on the investigational drug. 6 While some data may be collected during the course of treatment through compassionate use and expanded access protocols, the provision of drug through these avenues does not meet the generally accepted gold standard of a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to answer a question or questions asked a priori. The uncontrolled settings in which these products are used casts doubt on the integrity of any data collected. The use of a proper comparator arm is also not typically an option, as a provider seeking compassionate use of investigational drug for one patient is likely to request it for all similar patients, thereby eliminating any chance at a proper control group with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug.

Providing the most promising investigational EVD therapies during the 2014-2015 outbreak was also complicated by their limited availability. Even if the drugs were made universally available through compassionate use, their demand would quickly outstrip their supply. From this perspective, making the drugs available only for a randomized controlled trial does not deprive the population the opportunity to receive an investigational treatment, but instead randomly redistributes the drug among those who wish to receive it. In the case of a randomized controlled trial, in contrast to compassionate use alone, society benefits from the data obtained.

From an economic perspective, the widespread provision of investigational treatments for compassionate use, in lieu of clinical trials, may inadvertently send a dangerous signal to pharmaceutical companies developing drugs for rare but deadly diseases. While these companies are allowed by US law to charge for their investigational drugs used under compassionate use provisions, 21 CFR 312.8(d)(1) states that ""a sponsor may recover only the direct costs of making its investigational drug available."" 7 While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does allow for the manufacturer to recoup direct costs, many other costs are not compensated, unlike products with marketing authorization, such as those to recoup research and development costs. For example, the overhead costs associated with maintaining the safety oversight system becomes increasingly complicated when an investigational product is made available outside the context of traditional well-defined clinical trials. The greatest cost to manufacturers for the provision of a drug under compassionate use may actually be the opportunity cost of collecting data on their product to gain marketing authorization. The provision of a product under expanded access in an outbreak rather than the conduct of a controlled clinical trial to collect data to support approval has the potential to deny the pharmaceutical company from valuable information to support a marketing application. This translates to a time cost for approval, which also has a societal cost, as fewer patients will have access to the product prior to approval.

NIAID's initial EVD study, Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL), was launched within four months of the initial research invitation. PREVAIL was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two EVD vaccines among volunteers in the midst of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. 8 The ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine (GlaxoSmith Kline) consisted of a ChAd3 vector with a DNA fragment insert that encodes the EVD virus glycoprotein. The VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (NewLink/Merck) was comprised of a single recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolate modified to replace the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein (GP) with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the EVD virus Zaire strain (ZEBOV). The first phase of the study was to include 1,500 EVD-free adult volunteers at one clinical site on the outskirts of Monrovia and expand to 27,000 volunteers at multiple sites around the country. Fortunately for the people of Liberia, the public health measures they implemented were successful in bringing the bulk of the epidemic to a close by May of 2015 at about the same time that the initial 1,500 participants were enrolled. The data and safety monitoring board recommended against expanding the trial as it would have been statistically futile to achieve the number of endpoints to determine a difference between the study vaccines and placebo. While an efficacy endpoint was not possible, substantial safety and immunogenicity data were obtained to support a future licensure application. 9

The 4-month implementation for the NIAID PREVAIL study was quite remarkable given the context and location of the outbreak. Liberia is still recovering from a 10-year civil war that has left inconsistent availability of basic services such as health, electricity, and water. The introduction of a clinical research program required the establishment of facilities, identification of reliable power for cold-chain requirements, hiring and training a sizable workforce, and establishment of a clinical research protocol in a collaborative manner.

Additional clinical studies were eventually launched in Guinea and Sierra Leone. In April 2015, a collaboration between the Sierra Leone College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences and the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched the STRIVE trial (Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against EVD). 10 STRIVE was designed as an immediate versus delayed immunization strategy using the VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in health and frontline workers. The STRIVE study faced a similar challenge as PREVAIL as a result of the waning incidence of EVD.

In Guinea, the Ministry of Health along with the World Health Organization and several non-governmental organizations collaborated to conduct a study employing a ring vaccination cluster-randomized design with the VSVÎGZEBOV-GP vaccine. 11 An interim report indicated the strategy might be efficacious. However, questions remain regarding the statistical methods and assumptions made regarding the incidence of Ebola in the immediate and delayed clusters. 12 Therefore, it is not known if that data will be sufficient for licensure. Hopefully with the results from the Guinean study together with data from other studies, as well as from animal efficacy studies, licensure of VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine may be possible. Regardless, the process followed by the WHO highlights the importance of working with regulatory agencies in an a priori manner to understand the implications of study designs on the potential applicability of the chosen methodology as it relates to the later use of research results to support licensure.

Through an iterative planning process initiated over a year before the EVD outbreak, the US Government research community and several partners, aiming to include frequent consultation with the FDA, identified a study design known as the Medical Countermeasures Study. 13 The initial agent selected for this study was ZMapp. ZMapp is a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies that target the surface glycoprotein of EVD and is an investigational therapeutic for EVD. 14 Implementation of PREVAIL II in West Africa required flexibility and ingenuity on a number of fronts. First, as the study involved inclusion of multiple sites in both Sierra Leone and Guinea, establishing cold-chain and clinical trial operations processes in those countries involved different approaches. In Sierra Leone, NIAID collaborated with the CDC in the utilization of a storage facility co-located with the UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) Expanded Program for Immunization. To implement the study, NIAID rotated in teams consisting of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and logisticians to work with the medical staffs at participating EVD Treatment Units (ETUs). Additional in-country staff were hired to help with data collection and maintaining contact with research participants after they were discharged. In Guinea, NIAID worked with an INSERM (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) team of clinical research personnel who were embedded in an ETU under management by the French Red Cross. In Guinea as in Liberia, NIAID was able to utilize cold-chain storage available through the US Embassy.

PREVAIL II used a unique, adaptive clinical trial design with frequent interim monitoring in order to rapidly assess the effectiveness of ZMapp plus standard of care arm versus the standard care alone arm. 15 Predefined stopping criteria relied on diverging mortality rates between the two groups, with smaller differences requiring the recruitment of more participants. While designed to enroll up to 200 participants, the trial was prematurely stopped by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for lack of enrollment prospects, with the enrollment of only 72 participants. While the standard of care alone arm had an overall fatality rate of 37% versus 22% for the ZMapp treatment arm, the posterior probability of ZMapp superiority was 91.2%, short of the 97.5% statistical significance threshold. 16, 17 Obtaining the desired enrollment for the study would have required participation by many additional ETUs. Unfortunately, the operation of the ETUs was not centrally managed within the country, and a variety of non-governmental organizations provided on-the-ground staffing for ETUs. Not all of those organizations were interested in taking part in clinical trials or, if they were interested, had philosophical differences with the concept of a placebocontrolled study. 5 Without the use of a placebo or nontreatment arm, it is difficult to attribute safety and efficacy to the intervention being tested. 3 It is important to determine if the study intervention harms patients, especially if there is an opportunity cost associated with the use of one treatment in lieu of another.

Other therapeutic trials were conducted during the outbreak, but as some of these studies used historical control groups in a setting where the standard of care rapidly changed, evaluation of results from those studies remains problematic. Moreover, ascertaining the reason for the discontinuation of at least one of these uncontrolled trials will remain controversial. 18

In addition to controlled clinical trials, other regulatory solutions to introduce unapproved products include expanded access trials and emergency use authorizations.

As discussed earlier in this paper, as the EVD outbreak waned, the opportunity to complete controlled clinical trials diminished in a proportional manner. Regardless, the need to retain access to the promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates remained in order to respond to sporadic outbreaks. In the United States, guidance regarding Expanded Access of investigational drugs can be found at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ ExpandedAccessCompassionateUse/default.htm.

When working internationally, additional options for expanded access also exist in that 21 CFR 312.110(b)(ii) allows for the export of investigational products for national emergencies. From a regulatory perspective, MappBio, Zmapp's manufacturer, and the FDA were keen to have patients enrolled in the PREVAIL II study, rather than providing drug for compassionate use to new EVD cases. However, from an operational perspective, NIAID and the participating countries ended the ZMapp trial in February 2016, as it had been more than 45 days since the last known case of EVD. It did not mean that the subregion of West Africa was truly free of EVD. For sporadic events that did occur, NIAID, as the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor for the PREVAIL II trial, did not request compassionate use of ZMapp in West Africa, but did provide regulatory advice and technical expertise to groups that did seek to use ZMapp on a compassionate basis for patients who were not eligible for enrollment in PREVAIL II or who contracted EVD after PREVAIL II ceased enrollment. Because the treatment of EVD is a time-sensitive endeavor, the only feasible way to get ZMapp to a patient in West Africa was through NIAID's PREVAIL II clinical trial supply. In this regard, NIAID worked with FDA and MappBio to allow for an ""alternative disposition"" of the needed number of ZMapp vials, pursuant to 21 CFR 312.59 and the previously mentioned 21 CFR 312.110(b). 19 Moreover, NIAID worked with the affected countries to ensure that mechanisms to provide the unapproved drugs were consistent with the FDA emergency use regulations. Provisions were established for participants to provide informed consent, and for the collection of safety and outcome data.

Within the US, expanded access INDs come under three sizes in accordance with 21 CFR 312.300. 20 The provision applies to (1) a single patient, including for emergency use; (2) intermediate-size populations that occur usually after the FDA has received a number of requests for single patient use; and (3) treatment INDs that usually occur during the time period after completion of pivotal trials but before the marketing application is approved. Criteria for application of this portion of the regulation require that the patient or patients to be treated have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, that the potential benefit to the patient(s) justifies the potential risks of treatment, and that the expanded access protocol does not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that may support a marketing application.

Outside the US, the WHO has attempted to identify potential strategies to evaluate investigational drugs for outbreaks such as EVD. 21 The WHO framework for evaluation is an attempt to bridge a regulatory gap between the American, European, and Japanese authorities and the regulatory bodies in developing countries. The goal is to provide thorough vetting of potential solutions via the experienced regulatory bodies and to guide developing countries on the relative merits of potential preventive and therapeutic candidates.

Plans are currently underway to establish expanded access protocols for VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine and ZMapp in West Africa. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) is collaborating with the WHO and Merck to establish a ringvaccination strategy with the VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP to prevent further spread of EVD in response to future outbreaks. Additionally, MappBio is working with the Ministries of Health in West Africa to make ZMapp available under a protocol that will allow for a systematic collection of adverse events and outcome data. These expanded access protocols will be necessary until either marketing applications for these products are approved or further research demonstrates that other products may be better suited for the prevention and treatment of EVD.

In the BioShield legislation of 2004, Congress created the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). 22 The EUA is different from an emergency use of an investigational product under 21 CFR 312.300 as the EUA is based upon a declared public health emergency. The FDA takes into account the availability of sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness and weighs it against the communicability, morbidity, and mortality of the threat. As the EUA does not involve documentation of individual informed consent, one of the key reviews is that of the information to be provided to health care providers and individual patients.

The first use of an EUA in 2005 allowed the US Department of Defense to provide for anthrax vaccinations to service members subsequent to a court challenge to the legitimacy of anthrax vaccines for protection from inhalational exposure. The EUA allowed for continued vaccination of deploying service members to regions of the world subject to high threats for biological weapons. The anthrax vaccine EUA was eventually discontinued upon successful resolution of the court case. Subsequent applications of the EUA provisions have been provided for emerging infectious diseases, in the realm of diagnostics, preventive vaccines, and therapeutics. For example, with the current Zika outbreak, as of September 22, 2016, there are 10 Zika diagnostics available through the EUA mechanism.

The biggest regulatory drawback to the EUA is that the approach does not provide provisions to collect outcome data in a prospective manner. At best, retrospective, noncontrolled information is available that provides limited support to any attempt at answering questions of safety and effectiveness. For example, the EUA process was implemented in 2009 in response to the H1N1 outbreak to allow for distribution of intravenous peramivir. Evaluations of that program are not well documented. Moreover, in order to collect data to evaluate the effectiveness of the EUA program, some sort of study needs to be in place in order to collect minimal data, albeit likely retrospective data.

An important question, which needs further consideration by the international community, is what role investigational drugs should play in a communicable outbreak. Communicable diseases are likely to present a more urgent need for patients to receive investigational drugs, as many infectious diseases have relatively acute onset with the potential for high transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. Although cancer is one of the more common diseases for which access to investigational treatments is regularly granted, cancer is a disease that often comes with at least a reasonable opportunity to consider the use by the treating physician, patient, and FDA authorities. Weighing the benefits and risks of an investigational product in a public health emergency likely comes under a certain amount of duress by all parties involved, and with very little time to decide on its use.

A unique aspect of communicable diseases may also be considered: the very fact that the disease is communicable, and the use of an investigational vaccine or treatment by one patient may have additional societal benefits. Unfortunately, the individuals using the investigational drug must usually bear the entire burden of risk, and the benefit-to-risk ratio may change to comparing the risk to an individual to the potential benefit of a population.

In the scenario of a communicable public health emergency, manufacturers of an investigational treatment candidate or vaccine with promising animal or early-phase clinical studies may find themselves in an unusual situation: federal authorities from various agencies, especially the Department of Health and Human Services, may seek out their assistance with the provision of widespread access to their products. Such was the case with ZMapp, although only following completion of the PREVAIL II trial. The FDA actively communicated with the company that they supported the use of ZMapp through a standing expanded access protocol until the time that the full submission package could be submitted for approval.

While several states have attempted to pass ""Right to Try"" laws with the intention of providing patients access to investigational medications, these laws do not appear intended to apply to public health outbreaks such as EVD. 23, 24 The decision-making calculus involved between cancer and EVD is substantially different in that the decision in cancer is between a patient and his or her physician. In an outbreak, governmental organizations are involved in establishing population-level programs. However, some similarities can be found in the early days of HIV research. Back in the 1980s, NIAID remained resolute in advocating for controlled clinical trials and working with patient advocacy groups, the FDA and industry partners to determine which interventions might work. 3 At that time no drug alternatives existed, and 30 years later, starting with the clear establishment of the safety and efficacy of AZT, continued therapeutic improvements have been made and HIV has moved from a sure death sentence to a mostly chronic infectious disease.

While the intentions of ""right to try"" laws are geared at providing patients who have exhausted all known alternatives with additional options, these laws may unintentionally hinder the use of investigational medications in the context of a public health emergency. 23 While it's entirely plausible that states can have a reasonable expectation of autonomy and subversion of federal investigational drug laws on a patient-by-patient level, it is unlikely that in a public health emergency the affected states would enjoy such anonymity and low acquiescence by the federal government. Public health emergencies often have a national security implication, and the news is usually ready to oblige spreading information and misinformation regarding an outbreak, and play-by-play information on the government's response. Moreover, the need for procurement and distribution of a large quantity of investigational drug in an outbreak makes the ""right to try"" approach all that much less practical.

While public health emergencies present a brief but important opportunity to study the efficacy and safety of investigational drugs for rare but deadly diseases and other threats, another pathway exists for the approval of these drugs: 21 CFR 314.600 through 314.650 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.90 through 601.95 for biologics, known as the Animal Rule. In October 2015, FDA released a guidance for industry on Product Development Under the Animal Rule. 25 As outlined in this guidance, the Animal Rule may apply to ""drugs developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life-threating conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances, when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible."" The development plan for these drugs may include animal efficacy studies in lieu of human efficacy studies to support marketing approval, provided that the animal studies are reasonably predictive of a clinical benefit in humans. The examples previously provided of clinical trials conducted during the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic in West Africa highlight the fact that the ethics and feasibility of field trials may change over time, potentially impeding the use of the Animal Rule. Animal efficacy studies may also provide evidence to support the emergency use of a drug under an IND or EUA.

With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been ideal for NIAID to have had in place approved clinical research protocols necessary to respond to the Ebola outbreak. In reality, several legitimate barriers existed. First, most of the vaccines and drugs considered for use in the response had not undergone phase I evaluations. Second, the quantities available of most of these products were not sufficient at the start of the epidemic to support clinical trials. Third, the infrastructure necessary to conduct trials needed to be put in place. Finally, as pointed out in the introduction, the important relationships to establish the necessary trust with the local countries needed to be established.

As the epidemic waned, NIAID research has continued in West Africa and a much stronger research capacity is in place. Studies on Ebola survivors are underway and we recently launched a study to examine the impact of an antiviral on residual Ebola in the semen of male survivors. 26, 27 Additionally, as discussed earlier in this paper, NIAID has assisted Guinea and Liberia with compassionate use of ZMapp and VSVÎG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine from its clinical trial supply inventory. However, the reliance on a clinical trials study supply may jeopardize enrollment in future clinical trials if a meaningful drain on study drug inventory is realized.

One final concern is that in resource-poor settings, where neglected tropical diseases and outbreaks are likely to manifest themselves, relying on investigational drugs and the presence of ongoing clinical studies to supply drug and operationalize campaigns, can create a dangerous shadow public health system, which shortcuts the development of a fully functional, safe, and effective public health infrastructure. Establishing realistic and reasonable pathways to licensure will benefit all concerned-the countries impacted, the global population at risk as these diseases spread, government and private research institutions and industry partners as well as donor organizations that frequently help respond to public health crises. The goal of a commonsense regulatory framework is to avoid shortterm solutions that have the potential to result in long-term problems such as continued requirements for global support. One part of the solution is to establish a framework to respond more rapidly with clinical trial protocols and supporting materials, including trained personnel if possible, with the anticipation of an outbreak. Governmental research organizations such as NIAID and others are well suited to work with industry in this regard, as the resources required to implement research in an outbreak are significant, and many of these drugs are unlikely to be commercially viable in the traditional drug market.

The recent West African Ebola outbreak provides the clinical research community with the impetus to be organized to respond to threats in settings that do not necessarily lend themselves to the conduct of controlled clinical trials in pristine environments. However, as presented in this paper, controlled trials can be implemented. The challenge is in taking the lessons learned from the Ebola experience and preparing for the next unknown future threats. A practical scenario for consideration in future public health epidemics without approved treatment options may be to initiate a randomized controlled trial to collect data to support licensure, with the concurrent establishment of an expanded access program for patients ineligible for trial enrollment due to inclusion/exclusion criteria or geographic location.

Mass Gatherings Health 1 Emergence of medicine for mass gatherings: lessons from the Hajj,"Although defi nitions of mass gatherings (MG) vary greatly, they consist of large numbers of people attending an event at a specifi c site for a fi nite time. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. Some of the largest MGs are spiritual in nature. Among all MGs, the public health issues, associated with the Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) is clearly the best reported-probably because of its international or even intercontinental implications in terms of the spread of infectious disease.","Defi nitions of mass gatherings (MGs) vary greatly, with some sources specifying any gathering to be an MG when more than 1000 individuals attend, whereas others require the attendance of as many as 25 000 people to qualify. 1, 2 Irrespective of the defi nition, MGs represent large numbers of people attending an event that is focused at specifi c sites for a fi nite time. These gatherings might be planned or unplanned and recurrent or sporadic. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. MGs pose many challenges, such as crowd management, security, and emergency preparedness. Stampedes and crush injuries are common, the result of inevitable crowding. Outdoor events are associated with complications of exposure, dehydration, sunburn, and heat exhaustion. Other health hazards arise from lack of food hygiene, inadequate waste management, and poor sanitation. Violence is unpredictable and diffi cult to mitigate whether the MG is a political rally or a sporting competition. With few exceptions, however, the rates of morbidity and mortality resulting from these hazards are rarely increased outside the event. Global MGs, however, can lead to global hazards. Mitigation of risks requires expertise outside the specialty of acute care medicine, event planning, and venue engineering.

For centuries, Muslim pilgrims have converged in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for the Hajj (fi gure 1) to participate in a series of sacred rituals that defi ne Islam. With about 1Â·6 billion Muslims and the obligation on believers to attend Hajj at least once in their lifetimes, this event has become the largest annually recurring MG in the world, with attendance reaching more than 2Â·5 million in 2009 despite warnings about pandemic infl uenza. Pilgrims come from more than 183 countries, leading to enormous diversity in terms of ethnic origin and socioeconomic status. Men, women, and children of all ages attend Hajj together; however, a disproportionate number of people will be middle aged or older before they can aff ord the journey. Comorbidities are common. The public health implications of the Hajj are huge-nearly 200 000 pilgrims arrive from low-income countries, many will have had little, if any, pre-Hajj health care, added to which are the Saudi Arabia's safety and security policies for Hajj attendees are well developed after decades of planning the annual event. Lessons learned have led to comprehensive programmes that are continually revised and coordinated by government sectors. Public health has involved global partners for decades. Far from being the only MG that aff ects global health, the Hajj is a useful model to understand the nature of risk management and the benefi ts of international collaboration and cooperation.

Pilgrimage is central to many belief systems and also appeals to mankind's recurring desire to be homo viator-a universal fi gure common to many cultures and civilisations, who wanders in search of spiritual enlightenment. In Hellenic civilisation, Delphi-home to Pythia the Oracle-was long a focus for pilgrimage. 3 Ancient tribal populations such as the Huichol of western Mexico, the Lunda of central Africa, and the Shona people of southwest Africa all included pilgrimage in their cultures. 4 Institutionalised pilgrimage came to prominence with the advent of world religions. Buddhism invites pilgrimage to Nepal, the birthplace of Siddharta. Hindus journey to Benares in India, and followers of Judaism to Jerusalem. Christendom has a complex history of pilgrimages through the ages including the modern era. Until the advent of modern air travel, the journey was associated with the greatest risks. A review of the historical data for the Hajj shows these dangers: ""â¦the oscillatory movement of the camel produces miscarriages, followed frequently by haemorrhage and death of the infant and mother. The caravan however cannot stop, and it is impossible to nurse effi ciently while the (journey) continues. If any portion of the caravan stopped it would certainly be attackedâ¦"" 5

Kumbh Mela is a huge Hindu pilgrimage held at various locations along the river Ganges according to the zodiac positions of the sun, moon, and Jupiter. Purifi cation rites involve bathing in the Ganges and are believed to interrupt the cycle of reincarnation. The highest holy days arise every 144 years, but the normal Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 3 years, and often attract thousands of non-Hindu enthusiasts. This is the largest human gathering, so large that in 2001 movements of the amassed individuals could be seen from space. 6, 7 The Ardh Kumbh Mela in 2007 attracted 70 million pilgrims over 45 days in Allahabad; on the most auspicious day of the festival, more than 5 million participated. 8 Celebrations are accompanied by singing, religious readings, and ritual feeding of holy men and the poor.

Managing rival sects is a recurring challenge. Administrators overseeing the event have to negotiate bathing schedules. Clashes have resulted in deaths-eg, in 2010, a vehicle carrying members of the Juna sect struck several people, setting off a stampede. 9 In 1954, a stampede killed 500 people. 10 The festival probably contributed to the 1817-24 Asiatic cholera pandemic. Pilgrims are believed to have carried the bacteria from an endemic area in the lower Ganges to populations in the upper Ganges, from there to Kolkata and Mumbai, and across the subcontinent. British soldiers and sailors took it home to Europe and then to the far east. 11 The epidemic ended abruptly in 1824 after a very cold winter. Although cholera returned to the Kumbh Mela in 1892, authorities of the Hardiwar Improvement Society reacted to contain the outbreak. 12 Diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera, continue to be a risk at the gathering despite rapid monitoring and prompt public health interventions. 13 Another pilgrimage with a focus on water and religious rites is to Lourdes, France. This village in the Pyrenees attracts more than 5 million Catholics and other enthusiasts every year. Their destination is a shrine and nearby spring where a young village girl witnessed apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the mid 1800s. Drinking and bathing in Lourdes' water is believed to ensure health and cure disease, and is featured at the Water Walk where religious stations are situated and water is available for drinking or bottling. Spring water is also routed to a series of bathing stalls used by more than 350 000 pilgrims every year. 14 Although health issues have not been associated with Lourdes' waters, the French writer Emile Zola visited the spring in 1891 and provided a graphic description of the baths at the time:

""And the water was not exactly inviting. The Grotto Fathers were afraid that the output of the spring would be insuffi cient, so in those days they had the water in the pools changed just twice a day. As some hundred patients passed through the same water, you can imagine what a horrible slop it was at the end. There was everything in it: threads of blood, sloughed-off skin, scabs, bits of cloth and bandage, an abominable soup of ills...the miracle was that anyone emerged alive from this human slime."" 15 Stampedes and fi res continue to be major causes of death and injury at MGs-eg, the Sabarimala in Kerala, India, and the Feast of the Black Nazarene in Manila, Philippines. Inaccessible for 300 years after their construction, Hindu temples of Sabarimala in Kerala's Western Ghat Mountains have become increasingly popular despite the location and winter openings. With the increasing crowd sizes, tragedies have occurred. In 1952, 66 pilgrims burned to death when sheds containing fi reworks caught fi re, and more than 52 perished in 1999 when a hillside collapsed under the weight of 200 000 assembled worshipers triggering a stampede. 16 More than 50 million attended the most recent rites in Series January, 2011, uneventful until the last day when a motor vehicle accident caused a panic that triggered a stampede, killing 104 people. 17, 18 Although authorities off ered compensation packages, they could not quell unprecedented public criticism of Kerala authorities and the national government. 17 Manila's Feast of the Black Nazarene has fared a little better after religious leaders and municipal authorities joined forces to change the route of the annual Jan 9 procession after two deaths in 2008, and many stampedes and injuries caused by fi reworks and trauma over the years. The authorities responsible for the MG also recruited thousands of volunteers to manage the crowds. These changes and the addition of an information campaign have helped calm crowds and reduce injuries. Despite an estimated attendance of 7-8 million in 2011, no deaths or serious injuries were reported. 19 

Protests during the Arab Spring in 2011 drew millions of largely peaceful protesters to central locations of Tunis, Tunisia, and then Cairo, Egypt. More than 5 million were present when the departure of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak was announced in February, 2011. Other MGs include political protests of the antiwar movement during the Vietnam War. 1968 was marked by massive student marches in major European, Asian, and Latin American capitals. Chicago, IL, USA, had a particularly violent succession of MGs that became riots after the assassination of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King and again a few months later during antiwar protests at the Democratic National Convention. By contrast, European marches in protest of the US-led invasion of Iraq were larger and more peaceful. More than 3 million attended the largest march in Rome in 2003 (fi gure 2). In 1999, antiglobalisation protesters assembled in Seattle, WA, USA, ahead of a scheduled World Trade Organization meeting. Along with international anticorporate interests and assorted domestic supporters, they successfully occupied Seattle's downtown core and the convention centre. Violence increased during the 5 days, culminating in a full-scale riot after anarchists joined in and police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The Battle in Seattle as it came to be known, caused damages that were estimated at more than US$3 billion. Despite the violence and very large crowds, estimated to be hundreds of 23, 24 Violent sports fans are as old as history. In 532, the Nika riots in Constantinople pitted rival charioteer factions and athletes against each other and Emperor Justinian. During the 1 month insurrection that ensued, half the city was destroyed and more than 30 000 people died. 25 Although sports violence continues to be a risk during matches between rival teams, the massive crowds, crowds in motion, and immovable barriers cause the greatest loss of lives. The worst sports riot in history occurred in South America during a 1964 football playoff game between Peru and Argentina when fans responded in protest after a controversial decision to annul a goal by Peru. Police responded by throwing teargas canisters into the grandstand. More than 500 fans were injured and another 318 died. Most were crushed trying to escape the locked stadium, others died from teargas asphyxiation. The disaster in Hillsborough, UK, in 1989 was the worst stadium tragedy in British history. 96 fans died and another 766 were injured as crowds surged into the stadium crushing others in front who were pinned against fences. Many of the deaths resulted from compressive asphyxia while standing. Ineff ective crowd control and poorly designed venues have also resulted in deaths at music festivals, most recently in 2010 during the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, in which 21 people were crushed to death and 500 were injured as a result of a stampede in a narrow tunnel. Occasionally, MGs cause structural stresses that threaten safety and security. In 1987, the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA, USA, was celebrated by closing it to vehicular traffi c. Though not catastrophic, the suspension cables had the greatest load factor ever when 500 000 pedestrians crowded onto the deck, fl attening its centre span. 26

Although the Hajj was undertaken in the Middle East before the arrival of Islam, the movements and rituals of pilgrims today have not changed since the Prophet Mohammad inaugurated the Islamic Hajj in his lifetime. 27 It has been recorded in Arabic literature known as Adab Al Rihla. Persian literature records Hajj in the Safarnameh (travel letter). At the core of Islamic belief is trust and this trust has been best exemplifi ed by the risks Muslims take when travelling. The Muslim individual must trust in his Maker and, in ancient times, in the benevolence of strangers who would host him on his perilous journey to Mecca. Nowadays, as a result of the dissemination of Islam across the world, Hajj removes national, cultural, and social boundaries between diverse people like no other event.

Hajj has been the focus of public health initiatives for centuries, as shown in contemporary medical reports. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] During the 19th century, the Hajj attracted the interest of European powers, particularly the maritime travel to the Hajj, which dominated until the arrival of air travel. Colonial powers at the time were suspicious of political Islam, which was referred to as wahabism. Direct engagement in Hajj-related aff airs was seen as too intrusive by politically savvy imperialists who recognised the sanctity of this little understood religious pilgrimage. Instead, supervision, albeit Series displaced, and management of Hajj were gradual processes, including surveillance, regulation, secure passage through the Red Sea and protection of British littoral interests, and eventually formal organisational processes, which would quickly become central to these hidden concerns. Imperial organisations linked cholera morbus, a non-epidemic diarrhoea, to Hajj, allowing a public health industry to develop that used health concerns to control immigration, pilgrim passports, proof of suffi cient funds to allow return travel, maritime regulation, and vessel quarantine procedures.

By the mid 19th century, most of the Muslim populations using maritime travel for Hajj were from the Malay Peninsula and Indian subcontinent. About 2000 pilgrims travelled from the Malay Peninsula and between 5000 and 7000 arrived from the Indian subcontinent. Although there are few reliable data, the total number of pilgrims was estimated to be 10 000. 38 ""According to the Turko-Egyptian Sanitary Commissioners at Mecca, the number of Mohammedan pilgrims collected in and about the Holy Cityâ¦amounted to two hundred thousand persons; composed of natives of Turkey, India, Egypt, Morocco, Arabia, Syria, Persia, Java etc."" 29 Most travellers came in small vessels of 100-300 tons under diff erent international aegis. Departures were concentrated around Singapore, Calcutta and Madras in India, Aceh in Indonesia, and other regional cities. Most pilgrims then, like today, disembarked in Jeddah, though some would land on southern Arabian coastal ports and then make a land journey through Yemen to Hijaz. Well into the 20th century, the conditions of passage were often appallingly cramped and unsanitary. 34 Many people died along the route from infection and dehydration. 83 pilgrims died on board a maritime vessel, which had embarked from Jeddah with 520 pilgrims en route home to Singapore. 34 ""When she drew abreast of the watcher she proved to be a pilgrim ship; the afternoon being hot, the travellers had all crowded to the port side to catch what little wind was stirring. Their numbers were so great that they appeared to cover all the deck space, while the ship was unable to right herself from the listâ¦"" 34 Eff orts to manage Hajj were initiated by Dutch-Indonesian authorities, not for wholly altruistic reasons. The Dutch had established an association between returning pilgrims and societal unrest, so they introduced heavily surcharged passports as a way of restricting the number of travellers to Mecca. The ruling empires focused on health issues and justifi ed inspections of Hajj sites for compliance with contemporary public health directives, often focusing on quarantine as a means of protection at a time when many international arrivals, including maritime travellers, were reaching Mecca. Their inspections were disappointing-the Annual Sanitary Commission visited the sites of Hajj and noted that the focus was not on prevention, but rather on the easy option of quarantine. 37 When cholera was reported at Hagar's Well within the holy mosque in Mecca, the British Consul at Jeddah requested a scientifi c assessment. Samples were analysed at the Royal College of Chemistry in the South Kensington Museum, London, UK, and compared with those of London sewage, which was a source of cholera at that time. Recommendations after their alarming fi ndings were sent to the Secretary of State for India who reported the well to be infected with the bacterium. 35, 36 Similarly, entrepÃ´t cholÃ©rique (cholera reservoir) was noted when authorities visited pilgrims from India intending to do the Hajj. These pilgrims were routinely detained on the island of Camaran as a quarantine station in the Red Sea to restrict the ingress of cholera into the holy sites. 37, 38 Pilgrims were detained for 5-10 days without adequate provisions or clean water. The long exposure to sun, however, was thought to be benefi cial for elimination of infection. After quarantine, pilgrims were often permitted into the site. Results of later studies showed a link between the pilgrims quarantined on Camaran with a series of eight subsequent outbreaks. The conclusions drawn from a review of these events at an international public health meeting at the International Sanitary Conference of Paris, France, 1895, were that the ""Turkish possession of Camaran remains the greatest hindrance to the abolition of cholera at Mecca"". 37 Infection was a frequent feature of the Hajj in the 19th and 20th centuries, not unexpected since infectious disease medicine became better elucidated and the fascination with the developing specialty increased. Epidemics of smallpox occurred in Iraq and Sudan between October, 1928, and April, 1929. A small epidemic of plague occurred Pamela Das

www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 12 January 2012 Series in upper Egypt and a larger one in Morocco (161 cases). 34 653 cases of typhus were reported in Egypt and 32 in Palestine during the same period. 34 These fi ndings led to some strong recommendations that are still relevant: ""The yearly pilgrimage will remain a danger to all the countries from which pilgrims are drawn as long as the conditions of transport and accommodation remainâ¦as at present. Effi cient reorganization of the pilgrimage in every direction is needed and should be facilitated by the governments of the large number of the countries involved."" 34 By the early 20th century, non-Muslim European powers were heavily engaged in the management of the Hajj and would remain so until modern Saudi Arabia came into existence and acquired fi nancial independence through petrochemical wealth. The comparison of Hajj in the imperial era with the modern Hajj shows the absence of Muslim public health experts or authorities in managing this pilgrimage. 39, 40 This absence would gradually change and with the arrival of Ibn Saud's modern kingdom and its investments in Hajj. From this point, Muslims would solely administer the modern Hajj in its entirety. 41, 42 

The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, so the date of the Hajj moves forward by 10-11 days every year, presenting planners with additional challenges of health risks that are associated with seasonal variation. Temperature fl uctuations in Mecca might be extreme depending on the time of year; daytime highs can be 40Â°C and higher, and night-time temperatures occasionally fall to 10Â°C. Hajj can coincide with the northern hemisphere's infl uenza season, as in 2009, increasing public health risks. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] Attendance in 2009 was not blunted despite offi cial recommendations encouraging pregnant women, and elderly and very young people to stay at home. 48 More than 2Â·5 million people attended, including 1Â·6 million foreign citizens, 753 000 of whom did not have valid Hajj permits. 49 To put the event in its local context, the infl ux of pilgrims is so great that it trebles the resident population of Mecca, which is normally 1Â·4 million.

Access to the Hajj for pilgrims has changed greatly with air travel gradually replacing maritime and overland travel. In the past decade, the breakdown includes about 92% of pilgrims arriving by air, 1% making the maritime journey, and 7% travelling over land. 50 Although a few pilgrims will arrive at Medina's international airport, Jeddah remains the major port of entry for all travellers as it has been for centuries. Increasing numbers of people attending the modern Hajj led to a 1980 decision by Saudi aviation authorities to partition Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport and create a separate south terminal to serve all pilgrims. Now two-thirds completed, the terminal's capacity is 80 000 travellers at any time. When completed, its fi nal capacity will be greater than 30 million passengers per year. Important new features include health-screening systems, customs, and immigrations security. Each of its 18 hubs receives pilgrim fl ights; all hubs have two examination rooms. The terminal also features large holding areas that allow effi cient reviews of selected arrivals in segregated parts of the terminal. This permits verifi cation of the immunisation status and administration of any prophylactic drugs and vaccines according to set protocols.

The overall design of the terminal permits visitors arriving without required visas and health records to be managed outside the main fl ow of pilgrims who continue through the facility to join assigned groups or agents who are responsible for coordinating details of travel and housing. These regulated services will also escort their charges through the Hajj site. In Islam, Umrah is a shorter pilgrimage to Mecca. Although not compulsory, Umrah draws an additional 5 million pilgrims per year to the country; Jeddah's airport plays a major part throughout the year, controlling access and enforcing health protocols. Groups exiting the country and returning home are also monitored, allowing comparative studies between the two populations. At various times of the year, but most intensely during the Hajj season, public health teams, both stationary and mobile, use mobile devices to monitor inbound and outbound populations. Protocols are based on regularly reviewed case defi nitions. Gathered data are sent to centralised databases for real-time analysis. Many diseases are monitored during a Hajj season. Those given specifi c attention every year include both mild and severe respiratory diseases, food poisoning and gastroenteritis syndromes, haemorrhagic fevers, and meningococcal diseases. Reports of all diseases, but particularly those with immediate eff ect worldwidesevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infl uenza, cholera, yellow fever, polio, plague, meningitis, and viral haemorrhagic syndromes-are expedited to WHO epidemiologists who work closely with Saudi authorities Reuters/Jim Young Series to analyse information and coordinate a response. The airport is also equipped with clinics for management of medical problems.

Humility, faith, and unity are emphasised throughout the Hajj. The pilgrims wear simple clothing, women and men comingle, women are enjoined not to cover their faces, children and adults of all ages are included, and families journey together. On arrival in Mecca, Hajj pilgrims do a series of synchronised acts based on events in the lives of Ibrahim (Abraham), his wife Hajra (Hagar), and their son Ishmael. Each pilgrim does an initial circumambulation (tawaf ) around the central Ka'aba seven times. When completed, the pilgrim leaves for Arafat, about 22 km east of Mecca. Hajj culminates in Arafat on the Day of Standing, when all 2Â·5-3Â·0 million visitors stand and supplicate together on the mountain. Mount Arafat is believed to be the site of Mohammad's last sermon to his followers. Many people attempt to pray at the summit believing prayers there are the most blessed. On the way to Arafat, the pilgrims make overnight stops for prayers and contemplation in Mina. Leaving Arafat, the pilgrims return to Muzdaliff ah, where stones are gathered; on the way to Mina, they stop at Jamarat bridge to throw stones at the pillars that are effi gies of Satan. When the pilgrimage is complete, the new Hajjee (pilgrim who has completed the Hajj) makes an animal sacrifi ce thanking Allah for accepting his Hajj. This is often a proxy sacrifi ce because the Saudi Government has established modern abattoirs that are staff ed by professionals who will do this on behalf of the pilgrims. Meat is then distributed to the poor, family, and friends. The fi nal farewell is undertaken with another seven circuits around the Ka'aba. Muslim men on completion of a successful Hajj shave their heads. After completion of the Hajj, most pilgrims exit the country at Jeddah airport, which has congestion so great that the telecommunications infrastructure has to be constantly updated to allow suffi cient capacity. A smaller number of pilgrims will visit the holy mosque in Medina. Some will also visit tourist sites in the Hijaz and the old city of Jeddah.

Because all Hajj pilgrims travel as part of small informal groups, there is order in what could otherwise be chaos. Groups take their shepherding of individual pilgrims seriously, with easily identifi ed group leaders who carry placards and fl ags and lead the entire group through the rituals without losing stragglers, infi rm individuals, or temporarily distracted people. Further, this fl exibility safeguards Hajj at the most pressured points, which could otherwise become treacherous. Despite this fl exibility, Hajj stampedes have been recurring events, most notably at the Jamarat site. 42 According to Islam, only adults should undertake the Hajj. The age at which Hajj is undertaken varies according to culture. Some nationalities seem to undertake Hajj at a uniformly young age (eg, Indonesian and Malaysian), whereas other nationalities defer Hajj until the late phase of life as a precursor to preparing for death. There might also be diff erences in sex distribution. Malaysia for instance has had a female dominated Hajj attendance for more than three decades. 42 In keeping with the Islamic spirit of compassion, Muslims are enjoined to undertake Hajj only when adequately healthy. Despite this strong scriptural admonition, many Muslims insist on Hajj even when wheelchair bound. Special accommodations for wheelchairs are provided at the holy mosque despite the tremendous crowd densities. These channels are wide enough to admit wheelchairs and one person pushing the wheelchair and are divided into two lanes (one for each direction). Pilgrims who are not well are provided transport by the Ministry of Health ambulance to Hajj sites as needed so they can complete their pilgrimage.

Because of the Islamic belief that death during the Hajj has a benefi cial outcome in the afterlife, a few sick pilgrims attend, hoping for death during the Hajj. Public health and religious offi cials do much to dissuade this belief, which is often tenacious. This cultural belief system aff ects care providers at Hajj, all of whom are Muslims (non-Muslims are not permitted to enter the holy sites). Anecdotally, this belief aff ects resuscitation eff orts of those in cardiac arrest, which once initiated (if the patient reaches the emergency rescue services in time) are unlikely to be pursued if not immediately successful. A do-not-resuscitate status is often requested by pilgrims who can speak for themselves. 51 Hajj itself has several qualities that aid public health security. 52 Attendees must practise specifi c behaviours for their Hajj to be considered valid, and these requirements are strict and closely adhered to by both clerical and community leaders. Crime is strictly forbidden at Hajj and the risk of violent altercation is reduced because of the weapon-free, drug-free, and alcohol-free environment. 42 Tobacco intake is also banned, curtailing the risk of inadvertent fi re hazards. By contrast with some other MGs, sexual relations are not allowed during Hajj and male and female pilgrims are accommodated separately even when travelling as families, eliminating the risk of sexually transmitted disease.

This observant, penitent, and sober crowd engrossed in worship is thus likely to remain cooperative and coherent if sudden events demand rapid cooperation with authorities. Insurrection, rioting, disinhibited behaviour, or hooliganism of any kind does not arise even in these extraordinarily massive crowds. Pilgrims are urged to safeguard themselves or others at all times, aiding the infi rm and assisting the fallen, behaviours that symbolise peaceful Islamic societies that enhance the public health security. The spirit of cooperation is central to a successful Series acceptance of the Hajj by Allah in the Islamic belief system and reduces the potential risk of disastrous events in such massive crowds.

Saudi Arabia's responsibility for the Hajj has aff ected the country's advanced health-care infrastructure and its multinational approach to public health. Although other jurisdictions have administered the Hajj, Saudi Arabia has invested in it. Within the immediate vicinity of the Hajj, there are 141 primary health-care centres and 24 hospitals with a total capacity of 4964 beds including 547 beds for critical care. The latest emergency management medical systems were installed in 136 healthcare centres and staff ed with 17 609 specialised personnel. More than 15 000 doctors and nurses provide services, all at no charge. This event requires the planning and coordination of all government sectors; as one Hajj ends, planning for the next begins. Infection and prevention strategies are reviewed, assessed, and revised every year. Coordination and planning requires the eff orts of 24 supervising committees, all reporting to the Minister of Health. The preventive medicine committee oversees all key public health and preventive matters during the Hajj and supervises staff working at all ports of entry. Public health teams distributed throughout the Hajj site are the operational eyes and ears of the policy planners.

In hosting the modern Hajj, Saudi Arabia has weathered a 20th century world war, global outbreaks due to newly emerging disease (including SARS and meningococcal meningitis W135), and regional confl icts. In this time, the country has acquired a unique, resilient expertise concerning Hajj-related public health. Important observations that are relevant to public health planners everywhere are part of this experience. One of the best examples of such cross-cultural translation has been in the preparation for Barack Obama's Presidential Inauguration and crowd management informed by the Hajj experience.

Yet the process of exchanging expertise is possibly even more instructive. Collaborative work on this scale shows the increasingly important global health diplomacy in which the Muslim world has an enormous part to play. First articulated by the US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, global health diplomacy usually includes the provision of a service by one nation to another. 6 The USA's rebuilding of maternity hospitals in Afghanistan or the deployment of the ship USS Comfort to serve as a site for temporary clinics in Vietnamese coastal waters are two recent examples. 53 As they struggled with the best responses to the global threat of pandemic infl uenza A H1N1, which coincided with the Hajj in 2009, colleagues at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Saudi Ministry of Health worked together to deploy one of the largest real-time mobile databasing systems, which was designed to detect disease in real time at any MG. Senator John Kerry discussed precisely this joint eff ort in a speech in Doha at the 2010 US-Islamic World Forum. 54, 55 This international collaboration was realised only through both intense personal dedication and the confi dence the agencies had in their people. Such collaboration strongly resonates with President Obama's renewed hopes for US engagement with the Muslim world, as articulated in his speech in Cairo, Egypt, in June, 2009. 54 People who collaborate, write, and disseminate information internationally have long been aware of the latent value of such informal, positive exchange. In the fl at world of medical academia, individuals have immediate and palpable eff ects. Fostering such professional dialogues are everyday (albeit unseen) acts of global health diplomacy. When investigators and physicians work in a shared space, unfettered by the global geopolitics, global health diplomacy becomes alive and vibrant. Hajj medicine, as part of the emerging specialty of MG medicine, provides an extraordinary platform.

Saudi Arabia's experience in international service through public health is substantial and is promoting the emergence of the formalised specialty of MG medicine. Hajj continues to provide insights into advanced and complex public health challenges, which are unlocked through collaborative exchange. 56 Disease and suff ering remain universal, even in the 21st century. Solving these challenges is relevant to humanity everywhere. Islamic scholars have long referred to Hajj as a metaphor for ideal societal behaviour. 42 At the centre of these ideals is a unifying theme: collaboration.

Saudi Arabia's experience of Hajj medicine contains rapidly developing public health solutions to several global challenges. Multiagency and multinational approaches to public health challenges are likely to become major factors in the specialty of global health diplomacy, engaging societies globally, and drawing the west a little closer to the east.

In view of the global public health threats that might originate from MGs, medicine relevant to MGs has become an essential specialised, interdisciplinary branch of public health, particularly hybridised with global health response, travel medicine, and emergency or disaster planning. 52 Agencies outside the realm of public health should be closely involved in MG medicine. In the operation and management of an MG, several sectorshealth care, security, and public communications-need to know how to interface with public health services and resources quickly and eff ectively. Involving public health experts with the broader civic planning for any MG helps with parallel transparency in needs and expectations, ensuring that public health considerations are factored into the entire planning process instead of intruding too late in development, relegating public health security Series concerns to little more than ineff ective afterthought. Delayed entry of these actors into the planning process can debilitate or completely disable adequate responses to potential diseases during MGs. Experts must educate civic planners about the values of early collaborative approaches to MGs for these reasons.

Conventional concepts of disease and crowd control do not adequately address the complexity of MGs. The need for MG health policies that are guided by sound evidence but anchored in experience shows the importance of calls for a new academic medical and science-based discipline. MGs have been associated with death and destructioncatastrophic stampedes, collapse of venues, crowd violence, and damage to political and commercial infrastructure, but little is known about the threats from MGs to the global health security. WHO has worked closely with international agencies to address such risks. [57] [58] [59] MGs pose complex challenges that require a broad expertise and Saudi Arabia has the experience and infrastructure to provide unique expertise with respect to MGs.

An integrative approach to enhancing small-scale poultry slaughterhouses by addressing regulations and food safety in northern -Thailand An integrative approach to enhancing small-scale poultry slaughterhouses by addressing regulations and food safety in northern -Thailand,"Background: In Asian countries, small-scale rural poultry meat production can face challenges due to food safety policies that limit economic growth and hinder improvement of sanitation and disease prevention. In this study, an integrative, participatory research approach was used to elucidate the sanitation and disease prevention practices in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in rural northern Thailand.","Interest in an integrative approach has been increasing, especially in the area of ecosystem health, in response to growing evidence that many important ecosystem changes are the result of human activity [1] . The current environmental imbalance is considered to be a factor contributing to the outbreak of emerging diseases, as well as re-emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hantavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and other foodborne diseases. Although traditional approaches involving medical technology combined with active involvement of social, ecological, and political disciplines can be an effective tool in controlling diseases [2] , there have been numerous outbreaks of SARS and other diseases over the last three decades indicating a need for additional methods.

Food safety is an issue which is related to ecosystem health that concerns all human beings, making it an important focus of public health strategies around the world, including Thailand. Cases of foodborne diseases are still increasing, especially in developing countries, so food safety remains a serious challenge.

Salmonella is one of the most common organisms causing foodborne diseases worldwide. In the US, Salmonella is the second largest cause of food poisoning, where it spread widely between 2009 and 2010 [3] . In EU countries, approximately 100,000 patients suffered from food poisoning caused by Salmonella in 2010. In Thailand, Salmonella was found to be the second largest cause of food poisoning, following rotavirus in 2008 [4] . The main cause of human salmonellosis is the consumption of meat such as chicken contaminated with Salmonella [5] . Processing procedures in poultry slaughterhouses have been identified as an important source of Salmonella contamination of chicken meat, [6] especially in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses where traditional slaughtering processes are common [4] .

To enhance food safety and control foodborne diseases, efforts have been made to enforce regulations specifying standards for poultry slaughterhouses in Thailand, however, many small-scale slaughterhouses have yet not been able to meet these standards [7] . This study aimed to identify problems related to food safety in poultry production and to develop a conceptual framework for elucidating the administration situation and the potential for enhancement of hygienic management of small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in northern Thailand to help them achieve compliance with standard regulations.

Since food safety, especially in rural areas of Thailand, is a complex challenge and involves many sectors, an integrated approach was applied in this study. The main stakeholders were identified in the early stages of the project, using participatory methods, e.g., researchers meeting with key stakeholders including slaughterhouse owners, as well as Department of Livestock Development (DLD) officers at the national and regional levels, to identify problems. The information obtained from discussions with stakeholders was then reviewed with experts in veterinary science, socioeconomics, and public health before being used as the basis for developing a conceptual framework.

Policies, laws, and regulations which include the key phrases ""food safety"", ""slaughterhouse standards"", ""current situation of poultry slaughterhouses"", or ""foodborne diseases in Thailand"" were collected from published and unpublished sources including the Royal Thai Government Gazette, the Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan of Thailand (2012-3016), the DLD strategic plan, as well as domestic and international research reports on poultry slaughterhouses.

Perceptions regarding the implementation of existing regulations were obtained through focus group discussions (FGDs) with DLD regional officers. The principle investigator and co-principle investigator led the FGDs. Purposive sampling was used to identify participants using the criteria: (1) DLD provincial officers; (2) heads of DLD district offices; and (3) individuals having responsibly for slaughterhouse control. Two FGDs were conducted with a total of 22 participants between May and June 2012. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze FDG data using the five-step process as described by Agus et al. [8] : (1) Following transcription of the interviews, summaries of the discussions were compiled; (2) All interviews were coded and categorized, outlined, then grouped under appropriate headings; (3) Similar headings were combined and categories were generated to reflect the study aims; (4) Analysis of the trustworthiness of the results was performed by asking a colleague to generate a theme list; and (5) Each transcript was coded by theme.

The Chiang Mai province is located in the northern part of Thailand and is characterized as having dense areas of poultry production. In 2010, more than three million chickens were produced in this province [9] . For that reason, Chiang Mai was selected to be the focal site of this study. A total of 41 small-scale poultry slaughterhouses (each processing fewer than 50 birds/day) were visited during the period from July 2011 to May 2012. Data on the current status of the slaughterhouses, especially data regarding productivity, economic status, hygienic management, and opportunities and challenges faced in improving the plants and following the DLD slaughterhouse regulations, were collected using a structured questionnaire and interviews (see Additional file 2). In addition, a checklist, which was developed based on the DLD regulations, was used for triangulation (see Additional file 3). The data were analyzed by way of descriptive statistics using the Microsoft Excel 2010 program (Microsoft Corp.).

Evidence of the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was used to elucidate the public health and environmental hazards of poultry meat production. A study by Padungtod and Kaneene found a 9% incidence of Salmonella contamination in meat processed by slaughterhouses in northern Thailand [10] . Based on that data, this study used a 10% expected prevalence. Sample size was computed using the Epi Infoâ¢ program with a 3% confidence limit and a 95% confidence level.

A preliminary survey found that, in 2010, Chiang Mai had 55 small-scale poultry slaughterhouses with approximately 25,000 birds being sent to these slaughterhouses each day. Samples were collected from slaughterhouses located within 100 kilometers of the laboratory at Chiang Mai University to insure that samples could arrive there within three hours. A total of 410 meat samples from 41 slaughterhouses were collected. Each carcass was placed in a large bag with 250 ml of sterile peptone water which was then shaken inside the bag for one minute, then the rinse water was poured into a sterile bottle and used for identification of Salmonella spp. In addition, environmental samples, including 500 grams of soil taken from around slaughterhouse buildings, were collected and stored in sterile plastic bags. In addition, one-liter samples of wastewater were collected using sterile bottles before the water was drained into the environment. Sample collection was conducted from July 2011 to May 2012.

All samples were collected in the morning immediately after completion of the slaughtering process, put into single use zip lock plastic bags, kept on ice in an ice chest, and sent within three hours of collection to the Diagnostic Center, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, for testing for the presence of Salmonella spp. The cold chain was not broken during sample collection and transport to the Diagnostic Center. Scientists used a standard Diagnostic Center form to record information on each ice chest including the number of the ice chest, the owner of the slaughterhouse, the sender of the sample, and individual sample identification information. Samples were then stored in a refrigerator at 4Â°C prior to individual sample testing which were conducted the following morning. After each use, each ice chest was washed with dishwashing liquid and water and then dried in a plate dryer. To further preclude possible contamination, each ice chest was withdrawn from use for between five and seven days after delivering the samples. The corresponding author (DVM, MS Health Science) supervised sample collection in the field. The Diagnostic Center is certified by the Bureau of Laboratory Quality Standard (BLQS), Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health.

Salmonella identification was performed according to a modified version of the US Food and Drug Administration Salmonella culture method (Bacteriological Analytical Manual) [11] , and ISO 6579: 2002 and 2007 with Annex D [12] . The prevalence of Salmonella contamination in carcasses, soil, and wastewater was calculated by dividing the number of samples positive for Salmonella by the total number of samples processed. Concurrent with the sample collection, data on the characteristics of the slaughterhouses, including slaughterhouse management and perceptions of the owners regarding slaughterhouse standard regulations, were collected by the principle investigator at the slaughterhouses using structured questionnaires and interviews. The questionnaire focused on processing capacity, biosecurity, disease control management, veterinary services, health status of workers, environmental management procedures, socioeconomic situation, and perception of zoonotic aspects.

In addition, a checklist of DLD regulations regarding the location of the facility, characteristics of the structures, the slaughtering process, and waste management was applied as a cross-check of the data. Descriptive statistical analysis was accomplished using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp.).

The main stakeholders in this study were the slaughterhouse owners, DLD officers at the national and regional levels, regional public health officers, and local administration officers. Brainstorming meetings and interviews confirmed the stakeholders' views on the importance of food safety and food policies in Thailand. They realized that poultry slaughterhouses are an important link in the poultry meat production chain, that the standard regulations should be followed, and that there are many factors affecting the improvement of slaughterhouses. They concurred that the main problems to be addressed are the inability of most small-scale slaughterhouses to comply with the current standard regulations and a lack of appropriate strategies to motivate and assist small-scale slaughterhouses to comply with these regulations.

The conceptual framework of this study (see Figure 1 ) reveals the complex interactions related to achieving slaughterhouse improvements. For example, there are three main government agencies responsible for the control of slaughterhouses: (1) the DLD, which is primarily responsible for animal health and disease control on livestock farms plus improvement and updating of regulations governing slaughterhouses; (2) The Ministry of Public Health, which is responsible for setting food safety standards for meat products; and (3) Local administrative organizations, which are responsible for giving permission to slaughter animals and to distribute meat, as well as appointing meat inspectors. To effectively assist slaughterhouse owners to improve their slaughterhouses and to follow regulations, government officers from these agencies must work together in an integrative mode.

The framework also includes socioeconomic factors affecting the improvement of slaughterhouses, for example, the association of education level and age with perceptions of food safety, as well as issues of income from slaughterhouses, living expenses, and family debt that could affect opportunities for investment in slaughterhouse improvements.

The main regulation regarding slaughterhouse control is the Ministerial Regulation on Determination of Criteria, Procedures and Conditions for Establishing Slaughterhouses, Lairage and Animal Slaughter B.E. 2555 (2012) [13] . This regulation consists of seven topics: (1) the location of the slaughterhouse, e.g., slaughterhouses must be situated far away from communities); (2) the area and structure of the slaughterhouse buildings, e.g., the slaughtering process must be conducted in a concrete building and there must be a fence around the slaughterhouse; (3) local infrastructure and the area inside of the slaughterhouse, e.g., the area inside the slaughterhouse building must be appropriate for operations, easy to clean, and include separate clean and dirty zones; (4) equipment and facilities management, e.g., facilities used in the slaughtering process must be easy to clean; (5) holding pens, e.g., pens where birds are maintained for 8-10 hours before slaughter must be constructed of concrete and must prevent pathogens contamination of the slaughtering process; (6) waste management systems; and (7) hygiene management, e.g., cleaning the slaughterhouse every day after operation. To be licensed by the DLD, all slaughterhouses in Thailand must comply with this regulation.

In addition, good manufacturing practices (GMPs) for poultry slaughterhouses were announced, and their adoption has been mandatory since 2006. However, in practice, the GMP guidelines, which were intended to further improve operations including hygiene standards, have been enforced only in slaughterhouses which have been issued a government license, most of which are larger operations.

In the FGDs with DLD regional officers (provincial and district) on the implementation of laws and regulations, the officers accepted that they could not strictly enforce the ministerial regulatory criteria intended to promote the improvement of small-scale slaughterhouses. They acknowledged that the criteria are intensive and require high levels of investment, making them suitable for large-and medium-scale operations which generate sufficient profit, but not for small-scale facilities with low productivity and small profits. They agreed that if they attempted to strictly enforce the regulations, they would meet resistance from the slaughterhouse owners. They also acknowledged that during their regular visits to slaughterhouses every three to four months, they should focus on establishing a spirit of collaboration and cooperation in order to promote hygienic management and disease control in slaughterhouses rather than strictly enforce the regulations. They also indicated that the current regulations should be more flexible and practical. As one officer said, ""It would be useful if there was a prototype or a blueprint of a good, hygienically managed slaughterhouse that owners could use as a model for investment"". The majority of the participants agreed with this comment.

Department of Livestock Development officers indicated an awareness of the need to work integratively with officers from other agencies, including public health officers and local administrative officers, in order to improve food safety. However, they mentioned that there were obstacles to such joint efforts. For example, working with local administrative organizations was problematical because those organizations still had no official role in that area or any personnel specifically responsible for slaughterhouse control. In the case of Public Health agencies' work with food safety control, their main focus is on meat products sold in the market rather than conditions at slaughterhouses. On a positive note, just over half the participants (54.5%) indicated that they were willing to work in an integrative manner with other agencies to address issues of food safety. Table 1 summarizes the reflections of the participants regarding the themes of the FGDs.

Of the participating slaughterhouse owners (see Table 2 ), 46.3% were male; 48.8% were 50-59 years old; 68.3% had completed primary school; 24.4% had been operating a slaughterhouse for 11-15 years; 82.9% slaughtered 1-50 birds/day; and 100.0% did not have a DLD license for slaughtering.

The process of slaughtering was carried out in openair buildings as follows: the birds were killed with a sharp knife, and the carcasses were scalded in a water tank at a temperature of 50-70Â°C for 2-3 minutes. Defeathering was done using semi-automatic de-feathering machines. The carcasses were cleaned by dipping them in a bucket of water. Evisceration was done by hand, using a knife to cut open the carcasses; this process was carried out on chopping blocks placed on the floor. The carcasses were then dipped in hot water (50-70Â°C) to firm up the skin, then stored in a small vessel containing ice. The wastewater from the slaughtering process was discharged directly onto the area around the slaughterhouses.

The majority of the small-scale slaughterhouses, which processed fewer than 50 birds/day, did not satisfy all of the seven criteria described in the slaughterhouse law and regulation. The owners constructed simple facilities with only necessary equipment and located within their community. Birds were sold only in the local community the same day they were slaughtered, but quantities were small, just enough to meet local demand. Incomes were limited and not sufficient to invest in improvements to the slaughterhouses to meet the Ministerial criteria. Results of the slaughterhouse assessment and the hygiene management evaluation are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Regarding slaughterhouse owners' perceptions of relevant laws and regulations, 33 out of 41 owners (80.5%) stated that some of the criteria in the current standard regulation were impractical for small-scale slaughterhouses. For example, meat from most of the smaller slaughterhouses was not inspected because the limited slaughterhouse income was not sufficient to hire a meat inspector. Owners stated that they would have to stop operating their business if the DLD strictly enforced all the standard slaughterhouse regulation requirements. Although 25 out of 41 owners (61%) accepted that they did need to improve their slaughterhouses, they indicated a desire that the regulatory criteria be more practical.

Salmonella spp. were isolated from 30 out of 410 carcass samples (7.3%) taken during this study. As for contamination in the environment, 12 out of 41 soil samples (29.3%) and nine out of 41 wastewater samples (21.9%) tested positive for Salmonella spp.

Over the last 30 years, several successful attempts have been made to control various infectious diseases in countries all over the world, especially in developed nations. However, threats still exist such as antimicrobial resistant bacteria and unsafe farming and food production practices, as well as threats created by the impact of urbanization and agricultural intensification [2] . In addition, traditional methods of controlling infectious diseases using conventional biomedical strategies have often failed, resulting in the emergence and outbreak of diseases such as SARS, H5N1 and H7N1 avian influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, etc. [14] . In order to address these challenges and to achieve improvements in overall health-not just human healththe crucial roles of social, economic, and cultural factors must also be considered. Thus it is imperative that nonmedical sciences be involved in the process of developing disease control strategies. To more effectively identify avenues for enhancing safe processing in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses, practitioners of veterinary and human medicine, social scientists, and economists cooperatively followed an integrative approach in the development of the conceptual framework and in participatory problem identification from the outset. That framework demonstrates the complexity of the problem and the linkages between the different disciplines. This study follows the successful integrative approach which was used to gain an understanding of and develop a suitable research agenda in the case of the emergence of leptospirosis in Hawaii [15] . This study evidences the importance of a transdisciplinary approach, as well as methods of implementing that approach as described and demonstrated by Pokras and Kneeland in their development of educational and policy initiatives to control the lead poisoning problem in wildlife, humans, and domestic animals [16] .

This study confirms that good hygienic management is not widely practiced in small-scale slaughterhouses in northern Thailand. This finding is consistent with the report in Bangladesh by Rimi et al. in 2013, which reported commonly observed improper practices such as slaughtering sick poultry in rural communities [17] . This study shows that, in general, hygienic practices do not fully follow existing regulations and that the government provided guidelines are not implemented by many slaughterhouses, e.g., the slaughtering process being performed on the floor, and the lack of methods or processes to prevent bacterial contamination of carcasses. The majority of slaughterhouse owners pointed out that they could not improve their operations in accordance with the current standard regulation. For instance, the regulation specifies that slaughterhouses must not be located in communities, a challenge to the small-scale slaughterhouse owners in this study currently located within a community. In fact, some of the slaughterhouses were in operation prior to the regulation. An authorized meat inspector is required to inspect the meat, but owners pointed out that they could not afford to hire a meat inspector because of the limited profitability of their operations. Owners stated further that if the DLD decided to strictly enforce the regulation, they would have to cease operation of their slaughterhouse and seek a new occupation, an outcome that would certainly adversely affect the socioeconomic status of the owners and their families.

Department of Livestock Development regional officers agreed that the current laws and regulations are, in fact, more suitable for large-and medium-scale operations which can afford the necessary high investment. Nonetheless, the DLD is attempting to encourage even small-scale poultry slaughterhouses to meet the standard. The slaughterhouse blueprint developed by the DLD and distributed to officers and slaughterhouse owners, however, is designed for operations processing 200-300 birds/day which is four or more times the daily production of small-scale slaughterhouses. Thus, the DLD-proposed blueprint poses a considerable challenge to small-scale slaughterhouses.

The importance of Salmonella as a public health hazard was clearly demonstrated in this study, which found a prevalence of 7.3% in the final product (chicken carcasses). That figure is close to the 9% prevalence of Salmonella in poultry carcasses after slaughtering and final products in Thai slaughterhouses reported in a study by Padungtod and Kaneene in 2006 [16] , but much lower than in other studies, e.g., Kueylaw et al. in 2008 [7] found a prevalence of Salmonella of 43%. Reports from elsewhere in the world also indicate a higher prevalence of Salmonella. For example, Elgroud [21] .

Salmonella prevalence in these reports is significantly higher than that found in this study. One possible reason for the lower Salmonella prevalence found in the current study could be that the survey was conducted at smallscale facilities, the majority of which processed fewer than 50 birds/day. Processing fewer birds might result in a lower bacterial load in those facilities and thus a lower Salmonella prevalence in carcasses compared with other studies such as the one by Padungtod and Kaneene (2006) , which was done in medium-and large-scale slaughterhouses. Moreover, the traditional slaughtering process commonly found in smaller operations includes the final processing step of immersing the carcass in hot water for a short time to firm the skin. Immersion makes the skin more attractive, an important factor for small-scale operations which sell the final product (carcasses) in the local community. That process also has the effect of decreasing pathogen contamination. However, this method could also have the negative effect of increasing the temperature of the carcasses, making them more suitable for bacterial growth and thus more susceptible to rotting. For that reason, it is not appropriate for carcasses treated this way to be stored overnight.

The 29.3% prevalence of Salmonella contamination found in soil collected around slaughterhouse buildings and the 21.9% contamination rate in wastewater drained onto the area around the slaughterhouse without treatment, however, is evidence that improper hygienic practices can affect not only end consumers, but also members of the local community and the surrounding environment. These results mirror findings in previous studies in other regions of the world. For example, 100.0% of sludge samples collected from eight pig and five poultry slaughterhouses in Belgium and the Netherlands were found to be contaminated with Salmonella [22] , and 7.4% of treated effluent samples from seven pig and seven poultry slaughterhouses in Brazil taken in 2003-2004 were positive for Salmonella spp. [23] . Seven out of 22 samples (31.8%) obtained in 1993 from untreated wastewater from Nigerian slaughterhouses and river water collected at sites near those slaughterhouses tested positive for Salmonella [24] . Thus, it can be inferred that slaughterhouses are a potential source for dissemination of foodborne pathogens into the environment, especially where poorly treated or untreated wastewater is discharged directly into the environment.

Improving small-scale poultry slaughterhouses to meet food safety standards and addressing the standard certification requirement are challenges that need to be addressed. This study, which found that unsatisfactory and inadequate management of hygiene was common in small-scale poultry slaughterhouses in Thailand, demonstrates that the use of an integrative approach for exploring a complex problem and developing a research conceptual framework can be an effective approach. Even though the level of Salmonella contamination found in carcasses was low compared with some previous studies, hygiene management should be improved to enhance food

Could influenza transmission be reduced by restricting mass gatherings? Towards an evidence-based policy framework,Introduction: Mass gatherings (MG) may provide ideal conditions for influenza transmission. The evidence for an association between MG and influenza transmission is reviewed to assess whether restricting MG may reduce transmission.,"It is well established that influenza is transmitted from person to person through close contact with an infected, symptomatic individual. The exact mechanisms by which transmission occurs are still unclear, but is believed to involve multiple routes, including respiratory droplets and direct/indirect contact [1] with secretions or fomites. Aerosol transmission may also occur, but controversy surrounds this [2] and some further evidence of aerosol transmission has recently been put forward [3] . This is an important issue as the mechanism of transmission is always a key factor in infection control planning.

While uncertainty persists regarding aerosols, droplet and contact transmission remain largely regarded as the most important and likely routes. Transmission through these routes clearly requires physical nearness to infected persons, via either direct touch or the propulsion of large droplets across a relatively short distance. This requirement makes the consideration of mass gatherings a crucial issue.

Whilst there is not a ''standard'' definition of what constitutes a mass gathering, there is an understanding that these are events that involve large numbers of people (suggested minimum of 1000 people) [4] [5] [6] congregating in finite geographical areas to share an event or experience. Individuals can be in very close proximity for variable periods of time and, if the event is over a number of days, may even share over-crowded and/or temporary accommodation.

Therefore for those infectious diseases such as influenza, where close contact is the main determinant of transmission, it appears self-evident that mass gathering events could lead to the rapid transmission of a new causative agent.

In the event of an influenza pandemic, minimizing transmission of influenza has been a priority for public health action. A variety of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to reduce close contact between infected and susceptible individuals, or the opportunities for the virus to be picked up by susceptible people such as self-isolation of patients, respiratory etiquette and hand washing have been advocated. Banning or restricting mass gatherings has been seen as a logical extension of this policy, however, it is a particular concern of policy makers that the scientific evidence upon which to base guidance for mass gatherings is lacking. This is particularly important given the need to weigh any potential benefits against the economic and social disruption that banning or restricting mass gatherings could have on society.

There have been other systematic reviews undertaken in recent years on the broader subject of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing transmission of respiratory viral infections [7, 8] . These reviews considered a range of such interventions, and they explicitly recognized that there is a paucity of primary evidence regarding restriction of mass gatherings (and other ''social distancing'' measures); thus they did not primarily focus on this specific area.

The aim of this review, therefore, was to attempt to reduce this evidence gap by assessing the available evidence base relating to the utility of restrictions on mass gatherings during an influenza pandemic. This is an important policy area not only because of the impact such restrictions could have on public confidence and morale, but also because of the economic and liability issues that such action might generate. The findings of the review may be able to help inform policy statements on the effectiveness of mass gathering restriction interventions that may be deployed to help reduce influenza virus spread during a pandemic.

The study protocol was largely based on the University of YorkÃs Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance for undertaking reviews in healthcare [9] . Work commenced in mid-July 2010 and the main part of it was completed in mid-October 2010. Further work was carried out in June 2011 to bring the literature coverage up to date.

The following specific questions were developed to capture the objectives of the review:

â¢ Is there an association between mass gatherings and influenza outbreaks or spread? â¢ Are there any particular characteristics (such as size or duration) of mass gatherings that influence transmission of influenza? â¢ Does the restriction of mass gatherings reduce the spread of influenza within the community (compared with no restriction or with other interventions)?

The following types of studies were included in the review:

â¢ Randomized controlled trial â¢ Quasi-experimental study -Non-randomized controlled study -Before-and-after study

â¢ Observational study -Cohort study -Case-control study

â¢ Outbreak reports -Outbreak/cluster reports -Historical archival outbreak analyses

â¢ Surveillance reports -Major event infection surveillance reports

The list above is largely in hierarchical order of study design quality [9] , but with the addition of outbreak and surveillance reports, not traditionally included in such lists, important to the topic of this review. To cover the other ''non-standard'' study design encountered, the term ''quasi-experimental'' is employed to describe controlled but nonrandomized studies [10, 11] .

Only studies published in English were included. Relevant systematic and narrative reviews and operational description papers were utilized for useful background information. The reference lists of the systematic reviews were scanned to identify potentially relevant primary studies that could be considered for inclusion. Case reports, mathematical modelling and human/non-human experimental laboratory studies were excluded from the review.

Outcome measures included laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (i.e., documented by virus isolation, molecular testing such as polymerase chain reaction, and serological studies) and clinical influenza-like illness as defined by the investigators, whilst recognizing that this is less specific.

The search strategy focused on primary studies taking into account the issues detailed above. The term ÃinfluenzaÃ rather than Ãpandemic influenzaÃ was used to reflect the entire spectrum of influenza for which guidance would be relevant. The transmission of other respiratory viruses was also included because of the similarity of transmission and therefore the potential applicability of any results to influenza. An initial ''scoping'' search was followed by further discussions and consultation on the work plan and search strategy. The term mass gathering on its own proved inadequate as a search term as there is no clearly accepted definition of what constitutes a mass gathering. Therefore, a range of additional terms were used, such as public gatherings, social gatherings, large crowds, mass events, festivals, Olympics, Hajj, championship, and others listed in Table 1 . Transit settings such as long-distance flights and cruise ships were not included, as it was decided that these settings would fit better in a separate review of evidence for influenza transmission through transport. The final search with revised terms and refined using the ''advanced search'' tool on PubMed was carried out as described in Table 1 , with no time period restrictions. The initial searches included the literature up till July 2010. A further search was conducted on 31 May 2011 to bring the literature coverage up to date as part of an editorial process.

In addition, secondary searches were also initially carried out in the following databases: Scopus, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). These are described in Table 2 .

In addition to the search results, the reference lists of papers identified from the search were scanned for other potentially relevant studies. Efforts were also made to identify studies other than those published in the peer-reviewed literature; the authorsÃ 

Study selection was conducted in stages. At all stages, scanning and reviews were done independently by the authors, who then harmonized their selections. Papers identified by the searches were scanned and some excluded on the basis of the Ãti-tleÃ for relevance to the review. The abstracts of the remaining papers were then reviewed to identify studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. The full text versions of all these articles were then sought and read in full. For papers that had relevant titles but no abstracts, the full text articles were also obtained, scanned for relevance, and if relevant they were read in full. In addition, some papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. operational descriptions of interventions, commentaries, or editorial reviews of influenza transmission or pandemic influenza) were selected to provide relevant background or supplemental information. Data from the selected full text papers were extracted using a pre-designed form. Data elements included publication information, study characteristics, participant characteristics, the intervention (if any) and setting, outcome and results. The data extracted were used to determine the eligibility of each paper for inclusion in the review. This process resulted in a final selection of eligible articles that were then included in the review.

The main body of this work was undertaken in 2010 by the UK Health Protection Agency as part of a comprehensive influenza scientific evidence review informing the UK National Pandemic Influenza Strategy. Within this context, the work was carried out within a very tight three-month timeframe and with significantly limited resources. As a result, some of the most comprehensive steps required of a full systematic review could not be realistically accommodated. Therefore, a modified process was adopted in conducting this ''rapid evidence assessment'' rather than a full, formal systematic review. Rapid evidence assessments are well recognized as a pragmatic approach to include all the major elements of a full systematic review, ensuring an outcome that is as comprehensive as possible while accepting limited compromises in order to meet stipulated deadlines for feeding into the policy process [9] .

Due to the time constraints, it was not practical to pursue time-intensive contacts with authors or to seek translations for non-English articles, which were therefore excluded. Articles lacking abstracts were largely excluded, and there was a limited search for unpublished studies. However, to try to mitigate these limitations, full draft versions of the review were submitted to national experts at the UK Health Protection Agency and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza committee of the UK Department of Health, seeking their comments and advice on any papers or documents that may have been omitted. Some further work was carried out in May to June 2011 to update the literature.

At the outset, a strategy was developed to assess the quality of eligible studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools as appropriate for each type of study [12] . However, after completion of the literature search, it was clear that the types of studies and the study design types identified were not suitable for assessment by the CASP tools. Similarly for the outbreak reports included in the review, no suitable existing framework could be readily identified for quality assessment. The ORION tool was not strictly applicable as it is specific to outbreaks of nosocomial infection [13, 14] . Therefore, a modified approach was adopted, whereby each paper was categorized as having low risk, some risk, or high risk for bias with respect to the relevant review question addressed by that study. The grading was assessed based on the presence of significant methodological limitations. A high risk of bias was attributed to papers with at least three significant methodological issues as identified by the review authors, while papers with at least two issues were classified as having some risk. This approach was adapted from a system previously used by Jefferson et al. [7] . The quality of the review itself was tested against checklists based on the MOOSE [15] and PRISMA [16, 17] standards. Within the restrictions of the time constraints already described, key gaps and issues identified by the checklists were addressed as appropriate and/or acknowledged in Sections 2.5 (explaining the review context including time constraints) and 4.4 (recognizing the study limitations).

The data synthesis was restricted to a narrative approach that included an analysis of the relationships within and between studies and an overall assessment of the robustness of the evidence and limitations of both the studies and the evidence review [9] . In addition, the synthesis considered the implications for policy and guidance development as well as future research.

The search identified a total of 1706 papers after accounting for overlaps between the different databases. These were reviewed on the basis of ÃtitleÃ for relevance to the review (Fig. 1) , and on this basis 1593 papers were excluded. Abstracts for the remaining 113 papers were reviewed and a further 54 were eliminated.

Full copies of the remaining 59 papers plus 6 papers identified from scanning the reference lists of review papers, and 3 papers retrieved from the authorsÃ hardcopy files, were reviewed and summarized. Table 3 provides a classification of the 68 papers that were read in full text.

After full text review, 24 papers were classified as meeting the inclusion criteria. These included a quasi-experimental study (a non-randomized trial) [18] , nine observational studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , seven outbreak reports [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , three historical outbreak archive analyses [35] [36] [37] , and four event surveillance reports [38] [39] [40] [41] . Details for each of these studies are summarized in Table 4 . The 44 papers that were read but not included in the review are listed in Table 5 .

One quasi-experimental study by Qureshi et al. [18] attempted to investigate the incidence of vaccine preventable influenza-like illness among Pakistani pilgrims to the Hajj religious gathering in 1999. The Hajj is an annual religious event that takes place over a number of days in a very small geographic area of Saudi Arabia usually involving 2 to 3 million pilgrims from all over the world. Accommodation is at a premium during this event and many pilgrims stay in tents specifically erected for the event and that are often over-crowded. Although primarily a vaccine efficacy study, the rates of influenza-like illness reported in vaccinated pilgrims were 36% compared with 62% in non-vaccinated pilgrims. However, these results were based on clinical endpoints without microbiologic confirmation; a non-randomized design was used, and the study was not designed to address the primary question of this review.

Nine observational studies estimated the risk of acute respiratory illness and/or influenza-like illness associated with the Hajj pilgrimage by attempting to measure its occurrence in pilgrims. Four [23] [24] [25] 27] of these studies confirmed the cause of illness by laboratory testing, while the other five relied on specified symptom complexes as surrogate indicators.

Among the nine observational studies were four cross-sectional studies. Balkhy and colleagues [24] tested 500 Hajj pilgrims in 2003 who presented with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in the second week of the event; 30 (6%) of the 500 pilgrims tested positive for influenza. Rashid et al. [23] assessed the burden of laboratory-confirmed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in symptomatic British Hajj pilgrims in the 2005 event. Of 202 symptomatic pilgrims who underwent nasal swab testing, 28 (about 14%) had confirmed influenza (mostly A type), while only 9 (4%) had RSV infection. In the 2006 Hajj, the same investigators [27] found comparable levels of laboratory confirmed influenza (10-11%) in both UK and Saudi pilgrims. These relatively low levels of infection contrasted with the findings in the cross-sectional study by Deris et al. [20] who based their assessment on syndromic influenza-like illness rather than laboratory-confirmed infection. They found an influenza-like illness prevalence of 40% in Malaysian pilgrims who had just completed the Hajj.

The other five observational studies were similarly designed, involving groups of intending Hajj pilgrims who were recruited in their home regions or countries prior to the event, and then re-assessed This was a well-organized systematic prospective influenza surveillance program, described by the authors as the first of its type at a large Games event Limitations include:

-No indication of total numbers of people at the event or in the city -No indication of the background ILI activity in the city or country; or whether this was during the local winter influenza season after the pilgrimage. Even though three reports were described by their respective authors as ''prospective cohort'' studies [19, 21, 22] , none of these five studies included an ''unexposed'' (non-Hajj attending) control group for comparison, indicating that they should be more accurately regarded as ''before and after'' studies. Choudhry et al. [19] assessed Saudi residents (attending the Hajj from a different part of the country) and found an incidence of influenza-like illness of about 40%. Three studies of French pilgrims by Gautret et al. [21, 22, 26] found rates of cough of between 48% and 61%; while in El-Bashir and colleaguesÃ serological study of UK pilgrims [25] , respiratory symptoms occurred in more than 80%, but the seroconversion rate was 38% of 115 participants.

These variable data underline the difficulties of comparing different studies that employ contrasting measures of influenza. Interpretation needs to take account of the fact that studies using clinical outcomes suggest much higher levels of influenza-like conditions than the ones that involve laboratory confirmation. Even among the laboratory-based studies, differences in laboratory techniques may also be significant.

There were four types of outbreaks in the reports that were reviewed. The first of those was a paper by Pang et al. [32] that described the experience of dealing with the SARS (severe acute respiratory The next group consists of four reports of influenza outbreaks occurring at a religious event in Australia and at three large, open-air music festivals in Europe. All of the events lasted several days and involved crowds ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 people. It is particularly relevant that the three music festivals occurred during the 2009 influenza pandemic-two at the beginning and one later during the pandemic.

The report by Blyth et al. [28] described an outbreak of influenza at a large, 5-day religious event in Australia during July 2008 attended by over 400,000 participants from 170 countries. Over 100,000 of the pilgrims were accommodated in a variety of make-shift, overcrowded venues such as sports halls, community centers and schools. One hundred laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were identified among attendees. Seven different strains of influenza were identified (four influenza A and three influenza B), highlighting the potential for the introduction of novel influenza strains.

Loncarevic et al. [31] described an outbreak of influenza at a 4-day music festival in Serbia during July 2009 involving over 190,000 participants, with a number of them coming from other European countries. Many of the participants stayed at a large campsite where overcrowding was an issue. Sixtytwo laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009) were identified; some of which were secondary cases. Although the virus was already present in Serbia at the time of the festival, the sudden increase in cases, in particular the secondary cases associated with the festival, suggests possible local spreading. The authors also reported on a small outbreak of influenza at an international sporting event held in Serbia in July over a period of 12 days and attended by over 500,000 spectators. Seven confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009) were identified in six athletes and a volunteer helping at the games. Although a much larger event, the numbers affected are considerably smaller and seem to be restricted to participants rather than those attending.

Gutierrez et al. [30] described a 4-day music festival in Belgium during early July 2009 attended by an estimated 120,000 people from all over Europe. Twelve laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009) were identified. Although sporadic cases of H1N1 (2009) had been detected in Belgium prior to the festival, an increase in cases was observed after the event and the decision to shift to mitigation was taken almost a week after the first festivalassociated cases were identified. The authors suggest that this festival highlights the potential seeding role for these events in the early stages of a pandemic. Presentation and discussion paper on data from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. The substantial research report arising from the study was included in the study [37] Memish Botelho-Nevers et al. [29] depict an outbreak of influenza at a 7-day music festival in Hungary during August 2009 attended by 390,000 people from all over Europe. Many of the participants were located on a campsite set up for the festival. Eight laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009) were identified. Cases of pandemic influenza had already been identified in Hungary and at the time the community influenza-like illness rate was 7.8 per 100,000 against an estimated 3.6 per 100,000 at the music festival.

The third type of outbreak report described by Saenz et al. [33] involved a large, international medical conference held in Iran during September 1968 at the early stages of the 1968/1969 pandemic. The 7-day conference was attended by over 1000 participants from all over the world. It was estimated that about a third of the participants developed an influenza-like illness with an overall attack rate of 36%. The virus was isolated from throat and nasal washings; this was found to be the pandemic A/Hong Kong/68 virus. There was evidence that close contacts of returning attendees were also affected, but none of the episodes led to a rapidly expanding focus of infection. The high attack rate raises the question of whether the indoor setting may represent a particularly high risk.

Lastly, there was an innovative study examining the 2009 A(H1N1) outbreak in Mexico [34] . The authors described the details of 202 cases and then used a series of epidemiological tools to map the spread of the virus throughout the country. They identified two major contributory factors to the rapid spread of influenza: one was the very high population density in parts of Mexico City; the other was the massive religious festival involving more than 2 million people, which took place in the cityÃs Iztapalapa neighbourhood at the very early stage of the outbreak, shortly before the new virus was identified. It is suggested by the authors that this temporal association between [39] Low Schenkel [40] Low the mass gathering event and the subsequent increase in numbers of cases may reflect participants returning to their own neighbourhoods across the city, and from there to other parts of the country.

Inevitably for a subject of research such as mass gathering restrictions, where prospective studies present serious practical challenges, researchers have sought to utilize historical data to try to draw out major lessons for current impact. This review included three historical analyses of the non-pharmaceutical responses to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic.

Markel et al. [37] examined the variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions that were deployed in 43 American cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. The combination of school closures and concurrent public gathering bans was implemented in 34 (79%) of the 43 cities and was the commonest combination of measures deployed. Applied early in the pandemic, this combination was significantly associated with reductions in the weekly excess death rates. Hatchett et al. [36] undertook a similar analysis on a smaller number of American cities where the timing of 19 different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions was available. They found that the early application of multiple interventions showed a trend towards lower cumulative excess mortality, but that no single intervention showed an association with improved aggregate outcomes for the pandemic. Both studies suggested that for non-pharmaceutical interventions to be beneficial, they should be applied early and in a sustained manner.

A further review of the U.S. public health response to the 1918 pandemic by Aimone [35] gave conflicting results. This review examined the public health response in New York City. In New York during the 1918 pandemic, mass gatherings were not prohibited nor were schools closed; instead, the city opted for a policy of staggered business hours to avoid rush-hour crowding, enhanced surveillance so that cases were quickly identified and isolated, and an intensive program of health education. The reported outcome measures for New York City were comparable with those seen in other American cities, and New York City experienced one of the lowest excess death rates on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

Surveillance reports from four major sporting events within the last decade were considered suit-able for review [38] [39] [40] [41] . The study by Gundlapalli et al. [38] reported the experience of influenza surveillance during the Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City in 2002. No indication of the numbers attending was given, but it is assumed that the numbers were large. Twenty-eight cases of confirmed influenza from three clusters of influenza-like illness (ILI) were identified and these were restricted to either participants in the Games or support staff for the Games. The clusters consisted of 12 members of a national team who trained and lived together, 8 participants of a sport and 13 law enforcement officers who worked and lived in close proximity.

Lim et al. [39] reported on the experience of managing the Asian Youth Games at Singapore in June 2009. These games involved over 2000 athletes and officials from 43 countries. Although numbers of spectators are not given, it is assumed that the crowds were large. At the start of the Games, Singapore had already reported 600 confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009). Six laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 (2009) were identified during the 8 days of the event-four on one football team. No information on the numbers of confirmed H1N1 (2009) in the population after the Games was available.

There was no increase in ILI activity during the Winter Olympics in Torino in 2006 [41] . The final study by Schenkel et al. [40] reported on the experience of syndromic surveillance during the FIFA World Cup in Germany during June/July 2006. At the time, Germany was experiencing a very large outbreak of measles. Measles is essentially spread by the respiratory route and is highly infectious. However, despite enhanced daily surveillance, no outbreaks of respiratory disease or measles associated with the World Cup were detected.

As stated in Section 2.6, the approach to quality assessment of the reviewed papers was based on a pragmatic framework for categorizing studies into low-or high-risk for bias, depending on the presence or absence of significant methodological limitations. A high risk of bias was attributed to papers with at least two significant methodological problems as identified by the review authors (Table 6 ).

The evidence to help address important public health questions around mass gatherings and influenza transmission is sparse, especially in the context of an influenza pandemic. In addition, the topic does not lend itself to ease of scientific investigation and there are probably many who may feel that it is self-evident that mass gatherings facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases. This systematic search of the literature identified a limited number of studies that addressed the review questions regarding whether mass gatherings are associated with influenza transmission and whether restricting mass gatherings reduces the spread of influenza within the community.

In attempting to understand and describe a situation or intervention, a common understanding or definition is essential. There is currently no generally accepted definition of what constitutes a mass gathering. However, the literature on mass gathering medical care highlights an emerging consensus amongst those providing emergency medical care at organized events. In this setting, mass gatherings are considered to be organized events with more than 1000 people in attendance [4] [5] [6] . A recently published guidance document from the World Health Organisation (WHO) expanded the term to cover any organized or unplanned event involving enough people to ''strain the planning and response resources of the (host) community, State or nation'' [42] .

The major limitation in trying to define mass gatherings is that any single definition would inevitably be too simplistic as it would need to incorporate events as diverse as the Hajj (lasting about 1 month and involving between 2 and 3 million people), and a football match (involving several thousand spectators over a period of about 2 h).

A system for classifying mass gatherings on the basis of size and duration is lacking and may be required.

In recognition of the difficulties of conducting hypothesis-based studies that directly implement and assess the effects of restrictions of mass gatherings in real life, an indirect approach was taken to address the review questions as follows:

To address whether mass gatherings are associated with influenza transmission, evidence was derived from the following: -A quasi-experimental study that was primarily designed to quantify vaccine efficacy in the form of a non-randomized trial. -Observational studies that assessed participants before and after exposure to mass gathering events. -Reports of influenza outbreaks and other respiratory illnesses at mass gathering events. -Communicable disease surveillance reports from some major events.

A number of studies [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] have consistently demonstrated, over a number of years, that respiratory virus transmission occurs amongst pilgrims attending the annual Hajj in Saudi Arabia, and it is recognized as an issue of international public health significance [43] [44] [45] [46] that could be particularly important in a pandemic situation. A significant proportion of pilgrims are affected by symptoms of either an influenza-like illness or an acute respiratory illness with the proportion affected reaching about 40% in some studies [19, 20] . The Hajj is, however, a unique event with almost 3 million people converging on a relatively small geographic area for a period of at least 5 days, extending up to 4 weeks. Crowd density is very high and overcrowding in the living accommodation is common. Given the unusual nature of this event, the applicability of these findings to other mass gatherings is therefore limited. There is also a question regarding the fact that several of these studies are based on clinical criteria that could be due to other viral respiratory illnesses besides influenza.

In a small number of outbreak studies involving influenza-like illness and confirmed influenza at large music festivals, there is varying evidence about the extent to which influenza transmission occurs. Outbreaks were based on laboratory diagnosis, and transmission was confirmed in all, though they had varying infection rates ranging from roughly 3 to 25 per 100,000. Two recent studies undertaken during the 2009 pandemic suggest that at the beginning of a pandemic, these gatherings may act as seeding events [30] ; indeed it has been suggested at the early stages of the 1999 pandemic A(H1N1), a huge Easter season mass gathering involving 2 million people may have helped in propelling the first wave of the outbreak throughout Mexico [34] .

There is no compelling evidence from event surveillance reports, such as international athletic events, the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, to indicate that these major events significantly increase community transmission of influenza. Outbreaks did occur in some cases, but these always seemed restricted to the actual competitors and staff rather than the crowds attending or the wider community.

Together, all of these reports point to the potential for influenza outbreak and transmission in connection with large, multiple-day, open-air events. Thus there is some evidence to indicate that mass gatherings may be associated with an increased risk of influenza transmission, but it seems to be very variable.

The type of mass gathering event seems to be of considerable importance in terms of the risk of influenza transmission ( Table 7) . Most of the evidence supporting the role of mass gatherings in the transmission of influenza comes from events where there are crowds with high crowd densities (which may be theoretically estimated at >5 people per square metre), and where the participants are likely to live close together for prolonged periods, e.g. the Hajj pilgrimage [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and large musical festivals [28] [29] [30] . In these events, accommodations which are already likely crowded are also likely to be relatively basic, such as communal camp-style living, with the probable risk of suboptimal hygiene facilities. It seems apparent that events where close contact among participants extends beyond event venues and into accommodation areas are most associated with influenza. Event size, per se, does not seem to be a critical factor.

In contrast, there is no convincing evidence that major organized sporting events are associated with significantly increased influenza transmission in those attending the event [38] [39] [40] . An important example of this contrast comes from Serbia, where two major events of different type and scale happened to coincide in 2009, providing a ''natural experimental'' opportunity for comparison [31] . In the larger event, only four event-linked confirmed influenza cases occurred at the World University Games held over a 12-day period and involving almost 25,000 athletes and staff with about 500,000 spectators. However, in a relatively smaller event held in the same month and within the same country, as many as 47 event-linked confirmed cases occurred at a 4-day music festival with around 190,000 participants.

Furthermore, in surveillance reports from recent major international sports competitions, cases or small clusters of influenza were reported, but these were mainly among the event participants rather than among the overall population of people exposed to the events [38, 39] . This was true even for one major event that took place within a pandemic context [39] . These events showed no clear evidence of influenza transmission, indicating that influenza may not be a significant cause for concern at modern world sports events. This view is supported by the surveillance report from the 2006 World Cup in Germany [40] , where instances of transmission were not reported, meaning that they were either not detected or very low.

This situation may in part be explained by the brief transitory nature of contact in the crowds in highly organized international sports festivals such as the Olympics and the World Cup, which are usually seated events with good spacing in-between seats and mostly in open-air settings with dilution of any infectious droplets that may be generated. The apparently low or absent influenza transmission at such events may also reflect the contemporary fact that many people who attend major sports championships tend to have planned their visit a long time ahead, as ticket sales usually start months or even years in advance. Spectators as well as participants tend to stay in more conventional accommodations such as hotels rather than tents or other forms of portable or camp-style quarters with highly crowded conditions. It is also important to note that contemporary major events are now deploying increasingly developed systems for infectious disease surveillance and control [47] , which are crucial for early detection and containment where possible.

The other situation of note relates to indoor events such as large conferences, typified by the international medical conference held over 7 days in Iran during the early stages of the 1968/1969 pandemic [33] . During this meeting it was estimated that about a third of the participants developed an influenza-like illness with an overall attack rate of 36%; the pandemic virus was isolated from those cases where testing had been undertaken. This potentially highlights the role that ventilation may play in the reduction of influenza transmission and is another factor worthy of consideration.

In summary, the type of mass gathering event seems to influence the risk of influenza transmission, key factors being the degree of crowdedness, the event duration and, possibly, whether the event is held indoors or outdoors. Multiple-day events with crowded communal accommodations may be the links to mass gatherings most associated with influenza.

To address whether mass gathering restrictions can reduce influenza transmission, the mainly relevant papers found were archival studies of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic [35] [36] [37] and an analysis of the 2003 SARS outbreak [32] . No relevant randomized controlled trials were found, reflecting the practical difficulties that such studies would involve.

Mass gatherings of varying dimensions were restricted at a large number of American cities during the 1918-1919 period. The reports again highlighted the difficulty of interpreting what was meant by a mass gathering, e.g. including schools, cinemas, theatres and other public places. In general, evidence suggests that these measures had a beneficial effect, especially where implemented early in the course of the outbreak [36, 37] . However, these benefits were not universal across all the cities [35] .

Restrictions were typically implemented as part of a set of interventions, e.g. combining quarantine and isolation policies with banning mass gatherings. As a result, it is extremely difficult to tease out the individual effects of mass gathering restrictions alone. Using multivariate techniques, investigators attempted to isolate the differential effects of individual restriction measures and found indications that certain interventions (such as closures of entertainment venues) had measurable specific impact [36, 37] , but this evidence is limited.

An analysis of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China attempted to probe the impact of mass gathering restrictions that were applied in a contemporary setting [32] . However, as with the historical studies, it was not possible to distinguish the specific effects of mass gathering restrictions from amongst the broad range of other public health interventions that were applied.

In summary, there is some evidence that when applied early and in tandem with other public health measures, such as isolation and quarantine and closures of educational institutions, mass gathering restrictions may help in reducing transmission. In a pandemic like that experienced during 2009, it is unlikely that the measures described above could be justified; however, in a much more severe pandemic, the cost-benefit equation could easily shift the other way. The application of bans on mass gatherings and other related public health measures are therefore highly dependent on an early indication of the severity as measured by its impact on individuals and society.

There are two further, critical domains of uncertainty that need to be considered in the development of evidence-based guidance and policies regarding mass gatherings. The first domain relates to issues around the current understanding about how influenza is spread, and factors that can affect transmissibility (e.g. host factors, pathogen factors, environmental factors and particle size) [9] . Key questions remain in these areas, which may be important in making specific recommendations regarding particular types and scope of mass gathering restrictions.

The second domain impinging on the potential effectiveness of any public policy on mass gatherings includes the whole range of factors affecting adherence and compliance. For instance, the experience of the 2009 pandemic has raised significant questions around how willing people might be to comply with bans imposed on mass gathering restrictions [48] [49] [50] [51] . Other challenging issues include the problematic ethical and legal frameworks for implementing restrictions for public health purposes [52, 53] , as well as considerable logistical and economic implications. If longplanned events were to be cancelled, who would be liable for the huge personal, corporate and national costs that such cancellations might incur? In considering policy recommendations within a pandemic context, the most practical approach for all but the more severe pandemics may be a strategy of encouraging voluntary restrictions. This would involve giving the public the best available information and advising rather than legislating that organizations and individuals avoid non-essential events where there is at least some evidence of transmission risk. For such a strategy to have a chance of succeeding, it would be most important to have in place a carefully and sensitively prepared communication strategy, since recommendations to avoid public gatherings are likely to run against powerful social pressures to do otherwise [54] . The success of any public health strategy-and this must be particularly true in relation to a potential or imminent pandemic situation-requires the building of trust [55] and an intelligent and purposeful engagement of the public even prior to the event [56] .

There are other important issues to note. Although this review has focused on mass gatherings, limiting transmission of influenza clearly requires a multifaceted approach. Some studies in this review reflected such an approach; for example, in the historical outbreak investigations where restrictions on mass gatherings were combined with other non-pharmaceutical measures [32, 36, 37] . It would be prudent to apply the best evidence relating to other social distancing interventions in conjunction with any specific policies on mass gatherings.

An additional question that should be considered is whether non-pharmaceutical health interven-tions such as mass gathering restrictions, actually reduce the health burden of influenza, or only modify the epidemiology by temporarily delaying the eventual impact of an event such as a pandemic. It is tempting to speculate on the possibility of a reduction in disease burden; historically, some of the American cities that implemented mass gathering restrictions during the 1918-1919 pandemic seemed to achieve significant reductions in peak morbidity and mortality that may well have reduced the overall burden. However, pragmatically, countries like the United Kingdom aim to achieve a slower spread, to prolong the troughs and to flatten the peaks of the epidemic curves to buy time for countermeasures to take effect and to enable services to cope with a lower volume of activity.

In this context, the most important point to emphasize is that mass gathering restrictions must only be a part of a range of interventions. The synergistic effects of multiple interventions is what would allow the best chance to achieve significant reductions in overall burden.

More evidence is needed on this subject. There is a need for well-designed studies to more accurately quantify the nature of the infections causing flu-like symptoms at mass gatherings, confirm the key parameters that influence the transmission of influenza in these settings, and to directly assess the impact of mass gathering restrictions. But as ''gold standard'' randomized comparison designs are extremely difficult to apply to this kind of intervention, attention needs to focus on optimal observational study options. From a UK perspective, British people travelling abroad for mass gatherings such as the Hajj or other large events could be approached for inclusion in prospective studies for comparison with appropriately matched, nontravelling controls, with care being taken to avoid drawbacks observed in existing studies. Within the UK, mass gatherings ranging from indoor events in theatres and cinemas, to outdoor events such as football matches and major musical events like the Glastonbury festival or TravellersÃ horse fairs represent potential opportunities for carefully designed prospective cohort studies to be undertaken. The biggest issue is persuading funders that given the current paucity of good studies, such further research is still needed.

As previously noted, this review has examined an intervention area in which there are a limited num-ber of relevant studies and there is limited common understanding of what constitutes a mass gathering. Despite these challenges, it has been possible to extract limited strands of evidence that may be useful towards policy development. Also, within the boundaries of the inclusion criteria, and despite the limited work timescale, this review was able to capture all the relevant studies identified by recent systematic reviews investigating non-pharmaceutical interventions designed to limit transmission of influenza and/or other respiratory viral infections [7, 8, 57] .

However, due to time constraints in carrying out this work, as described in Section 2.5, while every effort has been made to be as comprehensive as possible, it is acknowledged that the rapid evidence assessment process necessarily involved some limitations. The literature search is not necessarily exhaustive and there is therefore a possibility of incomplete retrieval of all potentially relevant studies.

While a range of study designs were reviewed, there was not a single randomized controlled trial that was suitable for inclusion. This is of course not surprising, given the formidable logistical, cost and ethical hurdles that make large-scale experimental epidemiological studies of the restriction of mass gatherings impractical and probably impossible. Some of the included studies had significant design and quality issues as duly reflected in the individual paper summaries and the discussion, and highlighted in Tables 4 and 6. A common issue with a number of the studies included in the review is that they depended on clinical symptoms like cough or syndromes such as influenza-like illness, rather than laboratory diagnosis of influenza. In such studies it is not possible to isolate the impact of influenza as opposed to other respiratory viruses, and the risk of influenza could potentially be over-interpreted. In the studies where laboratory testing was undertaken, influenza was only confirmed in minority proportions of people with respiratory symptoms, ranging between 6% and 14% [23, 24, 27] , but possibly up to a roughly estimated 40% in one study [25] .

This review did not include specific ''specialized'' settings that may arguably be regarded as mass gatherings, such as groups of people travelling for periods of time on cruise ships. The authors took the view that any transit-related settings would be best considered under a separate evidence review of influenza transmission through transportation. Modelling studies were also excluded, and it is acknowledged that their inclusion may offer an additional dimension in order to build a fuller picture.

The application of quantitative techniques could have potentially enhanced the simple narrative approach that was adopted for the analysis. However, there are insufficient studies presenting quantitative data on this subject, and moreover, there is a high level of heterogeneity amongst the identified studies.

In conclusion, there are limited data indicating that mass gatherings are associated with influenza transmission. Some evidence suggests that restricting mass gatherings together with other social distancing measures may help to reduce transmission. However, the evidence is not strong enough to advocate legislation or proscription. Therefore, in a pandemic situation a cautious policy of voluntary avoidance of mass gatherings would be prudent.

Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World.,"could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020.

The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19

outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.

The COVID-19 outbreak has spread widely across China since December 2019, with many other countries affected. The containment strategy of integrated nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation have been rapidly deloyed across China to contain the outbreak, and the combination of these interventions appears to be effective. We 

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on quantifying the relative effect of different NPIs and their timings for COVID-19 outbreak containment, based on human movement and disease data. Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts.

Given that effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are not expected to be available for months, NPIs are essential components of the public health response to the ongoing outbreaks.

As of February 28, 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak has caused 78,961 confirmed cases (2791 deaths) across China, with the majority seen in Wuhan City, and 4691 cases (67 deaths) reported in the other 51 countries. 1 Further spread has occurred to all populated continents of the World, with many anticipating that a pandemic is approaching. 2, 3 As an emerging disease, effective pharmaceutical interventions are not expected to be available for months, 4 and healthcare resources will be limited for treating all cases. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the

Chinese new year (CNY) holiday. People in China were estimated to make close to 3 billion trips over the 40-day CNY travel period from January 10 to February 18, 2020. 12,13 A cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province was put in place on January 23, 2020, just two days before CNY's day on January 25. However, Wuhan's lockdown is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before CNY, with around 5 million people likely leaving before the start of the travel ban, departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. 14 Since CNY's day, travel restrictions in other provinces were also put in place across the country.

The second group of containment measures involves improving the screening, contact tracing, identification, diagnosis, isolation and reporting of suspected ill persons and confirmed cases. 11 Since January 20, particularly in Wuhan, searches for cases, diagnosis and reporting have sped up across the country.

In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in ""Fang Cang"" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

Some previous studies have preliminarily explored the lockdown of Wuhan, [25] [26] [27] travel restrictions, 28-30 airport screening, 31, 32 and the isolation of cases and contact tracing for containing virus transmission, respectively. 33, 34 The conclusions of these studies are persuasive, there are still key knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of different interventions. 15 To fully justify the preparation, implementation, or cancellation of various NPIs, policy makers across the World need evidence as to the combination and timings of each, which remains lacking.

Based on near-real time human movement and disease data, here we conducted an observational and modelling study to develop a travel network-based modelling framework. We aimed to reconstruct COVID-19 spread across China and assess the effect of the three major groups of NPIs mentioned above.

As of February 29, 2020, a total of 79,824 COVID-19 cases were reported in mainland China, with most cases (61%) having occurred in Wuhan ( Table 1 ).

The outbreak increased exponentially prior to CNY (Figure 2) . However, the peak of epidemics across the country quickly appeared through implementing strong and comprehensive NPIs, including dramatic reductions in travel and contact, and significant improvements in the timeliness of case detection and reporting across the country (Figure 1 and appendix Tables S1 and S2). We (Table 1) . However, the apparent effectiveness of different interventions varied (Figure 3 and appendix Figure S1 ). The lockdown of Wuhan might not have prevented the seeding of the virus from the city, as the travel ban was put in place at the latter stages of outbound travel prior to CNY's day ( Figure 3 ).

Nevertheless, if inter-city travel restrictions were not implemented, cities and provinces outside of Wuhan would have received more cases from Wuhan, and the affected geographic range would have expanded to the remote .

Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold), but without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially. Therefore, integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment ( Table 1 ).

The timings of intervention implementation are also critical. The number of cases could be dramatically reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, if the NPIs could be conducted one week, two weeks, and three weeks earlier than the actual timing across the country ( Figure 5) CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Considering the delay in case reporting, our approach and findings can provide critical and early evidence for outbreak control decision-making.

However, our study has several limitations. First, as our simulations were based on the parameters estimated for the cases found in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan, , which might not account for the asymptomatic and mild infections, our study may underestimate the total number of infections.

However, public awareness and enchanced case searching remained high throughout the study period, and a high proportion of infections was likely to have been detected, with nearly all reported cases eventually subjected to laboratory testing. Second, our findings could be affected by bias and confounding because the modelling is based on observations over a short period. Although we have shown that the apparent fall in incidence of COVID-19 since CNY's day in China is likely to be attributed to the interventions taken, we cannot rule out the possibility that the decrease was caused by varying timings and intensities of various NPIs taken in different areas as well as some other unknown seasonal factors, e.g. temperature and absolute humidity. 43

Indications for healthcare surge capacity in European countries facing an exponential increase in COVID19 cases,"European healthcare systems face rapidly increasing pressure from COVID-19. We calculated pressures on EU healthcare systems by relating both country-specific accumulated COVID-19 deaths (intensityapproach) and active COVID-19 cases (magnitude-approach) to various estimates of hospital beds. On March 14 2020 -relative to Italy on March 11-we found Spain, Luxembourg, Switzerland and France to experience the highest pressure using the intensity-approach, versus Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Slovenia using the magnitude approach.","In the past days and weeks, it has become clear the SARS-COV-2 poses an insurmountable health threat on a global scale. Europe, and especially Italy with 17 666 cases reported by March 13, 2020, faces an exponential increase in the number of new COVID19 cases. Several institutions have communicated the necessity to 'flatten the curve' in order to lower pressure on health care institutions and to buy time for antivirals and other medication to become available in the short term and vaccines in the longer term.

Remuzzi & Remuzzi report that in Italy ICU bed occupation will exceed capacity [1] . Since other countries are considering to implement large scale interventions such as school closure at the right time [2, 3] , an important urgent question is how close other countries are from reaching an Italy-like pressure on the health system, and which countries are closest to such a situation. Furthermore, policymakers require information on the magnitude of additional health care capacity that is needed for the fu ture course of the epidemic, when at a later stage, new exponential growth may occur.

We calculated the relative pressure on national healthcare systems by determining the number of deaths and cases per hospital bed for each country. Three categories of hospital beds were considered: (1) available hospital bed capacity and (2) curative hospital bed capacity, as reported by Eurostat [4] from 2017 or 2018 (most recent data extracted) and (3) critical care hospital bed capacity as reported by Rhodes et al. [5] . As a first measure, we compared the number of COVID-19 related deaths relative to the number of beds, which provides an approximation of the severity of cases up to the present, and therefore also more likely to approximate pressure experienced on the health care system. The accumulated deaths to beds ratio provides an assessment that is likely less susceptible to inter-country variation in testing practices, and associated variation of underreporting of cases. We refer to this measure as the ""intensity-approach"". In a second measure, we compared the number of active COVID-19 cases, relative to the number of beds. The latter is referred to as the ""magnitude-approach"". We used the number of active COVID-19 cases and cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths in Italy on March 11, 2020 as a benchmark. These numbers, 10 590 active cases and 827 deaths were chosen as a benchmark, based on Remuzzi & Remuzzi [1] . The authors forecast the number of cases attending ICU to exceed the ICU bed capacity by March 14. As such, this benchmark acts as a reference for a ""soon to be overloaded"" healthcare system.

We retrieved the number of active cases and the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths on March 14, 2020 [6] and calculated the proportion per hospital bed for each of the hospital bed types for 30 countries. We calculated, for each country, six ratios by dividing the number of active cases and cumulative deaths by the number of beds for each bed type. Afterwards, we normalized ratios by the bedspecific benchmarks for Italy, which is defined as the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths (intensity-approach) or active cases (magnitude-approach) on March 11, divided by the number of all hospital beds, curative care beds and critical care beds, respectively.

In Italy, the concentration of critical care beds is at the higher end with 12.5 critical care beds per 100 000 population, compared to the European average of 11.5 [5] . In Figure 1 , using the intensity-approach, Italian hospitals are extremely impacted if we look at the numbers in terms of deaths per hospital bed (left axis). Spain is, next to Italy, the most severely affected country at about 45% (right axis), compared to the benchmark situation. Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France's health systems are also experiencing relatively high pressure, but at this stage still lower than 15%, in comparison to the benchmark situation. In Figure 2 , we show that the number of cases relative to the number of hospital beds is especially high in Iceland and the Scandinavian countries. Indeed, in these countries, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been very high, whereas hospital bed capacity is typically at the lower end for these countries. The pressure on the Icelandic healthcare system is even higher than in Italy. The Scandinavian countries are followed by Spain, Switzerland, Slovenia and Luxembourg, which all face severe pressure on ICU wards especially. But even if we look at all available hospital beds as a measure of health care capacity, most EU countries are relatively close to the Italian situation on March 11, 2020 -our benchmark situation. .

Ratios are normalized to the number of cases in Italy on March 11, 2020. Ratios were calculated for all hospital beds (blue), curative care beds (yellow) and critical care beds (red).

The measures proposed in this paper are an approximation to the current hospital capacity in Europe. Unfortunately, data on health care capacity is rel atively scarce and we have to rely on data from 2017 or 2018 for all available hospital beds and curative hospital beds. Data availability is even worse for critical care beds, on which we rely on multi-country data from 2010. Remuzzi & Remuzzi report ICU capacity of 5200 beds for Italy as a whole, which is lower than the 7550 critical care beds reported by Rhodes et al. It is likely that other EU countries have downsized their critical bed capacity too. In terms of curative beds per 100 000 population as reported by Eurostat, for most countries (all except Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania), we observed a downward trend in the past 10 years. Moreover, hospital capacity strain was recently found to be associated with increased mortality and decreased health outcomes [7] . Note that if we would assume the same extent of downsizing in Italy and other EU countries, our relative comparisons would not change. Our analysis shows that many European countries are soon to be confronted with a health care pressure that will exceed current hospital bed capacity. Based on the intensity-approach, we believe that for Spain, Luxembourg, Switzerland, The Netherlands and France the pressure on healthcare systems will soon reach Italy's levels. With respect to the magnitude-approach, Iceland, the Scandinavian countries, Spain and Switzerland were found to be more vulnerable. Where this is not yet done, policymakers should urgently expand their health care capacities to avoid pressure as experienced in Italy.

Making difficult ethical decisions in patient care during natural disasters and other mass casualty events,"OBJECTIVE: Recent experiences in the United States with unprecedented terrorist attacks (9/11) and a devastating natural disaster (Hurricane Katrina) have demonstrated that the medical care of mass casualties during such disasters poses ethical problems not normally experienced in civilian health care. It is important to 1) identify the unique ethical challenges facing physicians who feel an obligation to care for victims of such disasters and 2) develop a national consensus on ethical guidelines as a resource for ethical decision making in medical disaster relief. STUDY DESIGN: A survey of pertinent literature was performed to assess experience and opinions on the condition of medical care in terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the ethical challenges of disaster medical care, and the professional responsibilities and responsiveness in disasters. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop a national consensus on the ethical guidelines for physicians who care for patients, victims, and casualties of disasters, and to formulate a virtuebased, yet practical, ethical approach to medical care under such extreme conditions. An educational curriculum for medical students, residents, and practicing physicians is required to best prepare all physicians who might be called upon, in the future, to triage patients, allocate resources, and make difficult decisions about treatment priorities and comfort care. It is not appropriate to address these questions at the time of the disaster, but rather in advance, as part of the ethics education of the medical profession. Important issues for resolution include inpatient and casualty triage and prioritization, medical liability, altered standards of care, justice and equity, informed consent and patient autonomy, expanding scope of practice in disaster medicine, and the moral and ethical responsibilities of physicians to care for disaster victims.","O n Tuesday, September 11, 2001 , the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation was holding its scientific meeting in Denver, CO. The morning plenary sessions were underway when early reports of tragic events in New York City, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC, began to be seen on the television screens in the common areas of the Denver Convention Center. As the events unfolded quickly, the scope of the tragedy soon became apparent. The leadership of the AAO-HNS/F made the decision to continue with the educational meeting and kept the attendees apprised of what was happening. Because the national airspace was closed to air travel, individuals and groups began making alternative travel plans, including purchasing cars, renting vans and trucks, and even chartering buses. For those physicians who lived in the eastern United States, returning to their homes and work was vitally important. Because there remained the possibility that terrorist attacks might occur in other parts of the country, everyone wished to travel home. Many physicians made the long trek to New York City to volunteer as medical care providers, if needed. There was a general sense of professional responsibility and willingness to help, even at personal risk. Fortunately, the terrorist events were limited in scope and location, but they remain the largest death toll from this type of event in the United States to date.

The worst natural disaster in US history occurred on August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf cities of Biloxi, MS, and New Orleans, LA, and all areas between these cities. It is estimated that the forces of the hurricane were greater than that of the atomic bomb blasts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in World War II. The hurricane itself was a bad one, but the resultant loss of integrity of certain sections of the levees in New Orleans resulted in a tremendous flooding of much of the mid-city and isolation of many hospitals in the area. Dr Anna Pou, an AAO-HNS Fellow and academic colleague of many, was on duty at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans. Although many other physicians in New Orleans were either fleeing the city's flooding with their families or unable to reach their medical facilities, Dr Pou made the brave decision to stay and provide medical care to the patients and staff who, like her, were isolated in the facility.

As a head and neck surgeon, Dr Pou was accustomed to caring for postoperative patients in the surgical intensive care unit, but during her ordeal at Memorial, she also took responsibility for caring for very sick and nearly terminally ill patients in an acute care long-term facility located within Memorial Hospital. As resources began to become scarce and the conditions in the hospital became more extreme, Dr Pou and other health care providers found it necessary to develop a simple priority system for patient evacuation when outside relief finally materialized. Under extremely harsh conditions, Dr Pou made medical decisions that cannot be second guessed by those who were not there. After her heroic efforts, Dr Pou found herself facing charges of homicide in the deaths of four elderly and critically ill patients at Memorial. Fortunately, after nearly 2 years of difficult personal and legal challenges, Dr Pou was exonerated by an Orleans Parish grand jury's refusal to indict her. During the ordeal, Dr Pou was supported by the AAO-HNS, the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, and the Louisiana State Medical Society. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] These societies acknowledged the difficult decisions that were required under conditions not previously experienced in the US civilian health care system.

There are multiple layers of ethical issues that have arisen in the aftermaths of the terrorism events of 2001 and the natural disaster of 2005. At the very foundation of the concerns raised is the question of how much personal risk and sacrifice are required or expected of physicians during such mass casualty events. At the higher level, it is the difficult issue of how to make ethical decisions in caring for patients, both existing patients and casualty patients, in the face of limited resources and expanding scope of the disaster. As has been clearly emphasized by the situation with Dr Anna Pou, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon who voluntarily placed herself in a position to render a level of care to patients clearly beyond her training and expertise, most physicians in the United States are ill prepared to face the unique ethical decision making that is required in such situations. It is now apparent, with the constant threat of future terrorist attacks and natural disasters, that consensus national guidelines must be developed that will assist volunteer physicians to make ethical, yet appropriate, decisions in the midst of such uncommon and challenging situations.

There are both similarities and differences in the challenges posed by bioterrorism events and natural disasters. If taken in good part, bioterrorism events have the potential to place the physician at greater initial and temporally increasing personal risk for contamination and exposure to toxins or radiation from both the event and the affected patients. 6 With natural disasters, the initial event may pass, and the subsequent risks are lower with the passage of time.

Past and current disaster response plans have primarily been based on modern military models that have evolved over the years, as both the technology of war and the technology of medicine have advanced. 7 These models depend on a defined area of involvement, with initial treatment of casualties on site and subsequent evacuation by air or ground to a more sophisticated treatment facility in a nearby ""safe"" area. The terrorist events of 9/11 were sufficiently isolated so that this model was generally effective, although the Pentagon attack resulted in a rapid medical response on the grounds of the Pentagon itself. Using the military model and building upon the experiences of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, as well as the events of worldwide earthquakes and tsunamis, a new specialty of medicine is emerging-""disaster medicine."" A major issue that was found to be a major aspect of the aftermath of Katrina and is currently being addressed, is that of the ""surge capacity"" of US hospitals, in which acute casualties may overwhelm hospitals, requiring a prioritization of care of both the newly ill casualties and the chronically ill inpatients. 8, 9 There has been significant planning by agencies of the federal government since these two disasters, in good part because the United States was ill prepared to handle these disasters, both from a medical and a response preparedness perspective. The US Department of Health and Human Services issued a directive entitled Bioterrorism and Other Public Health Emergencies-Altered Standards of Care in Mass Casualty Events as a federal guide in response to the 9/11 terrorist events and the subsequent anthrax attacks. 10 One of the main issues addressed by the guide was ""how current standards of care might need to be altered in response to a mass casualty event in order to save as many lives as possible."" Additionally, the report proposed that ""the basis for allocating health and medical resources in a mass casualty event must be fair and clinically sound."" As part of the recommended use of altered standards of health and medical care, a model was proposed for emergency state health powers that recognized the difficulties of providers and institutions when providing care under stress with less than a full complement of resources. It was recommended that the plan would ""have to provide for 'hold harmless' agreements or grant immunity from civil or criminal liability under certain circumstances."" Rolfsen 11 addressed the ethical issues of liability or criminal prosecution in a disaster situation in the Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society. He stated, ""During disasters such as Katrina, many deaths of both previously healthy and chronically ill patients can be expected. Despite society's tendency to attempt to place blame for these tragedies, attributing causation of the deaths to medical providers is a complex process."" Contributing to the complexity are the harsh and unusual conditions under which medical care must be provided in a disaster, and the overwhelming requirements for medical resources in the face of rapidly dwindling supply.

Medical care during such disasters should likely fall under a state's Good Samaritan act to provide freedom from undue legal liability for the providers.

A major issue for discussion and guidance is that of the willingness of physicians to participate in the care of patients injured or ill from terrorism attacks or extensive natural disasters. In the earlier example of the rallying of US physicians to be of assistance in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 events, it can be contrasted to the isolation of physicians from New Orleans after Katrina who were unable to reach their hospitals because of flooding and criminal activities. Because most of the ongoing medical care of the Katrina victims took place at a distance from the actual flooding, many physicians volunteered to staff the shelters and make-shift medical treatment facilities where hundreds of thousands of individuals received medical care. Infectious diseases were rampant in the victims of the hurricane, and some analogy might be drawn from physician volunteerism in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemics. Ruderman and associates 12 reported on the issue of ""the duty to care"" by health care professionals. They noted that physicians and nurses who volunteered during the SARS pandemic in 2003 ""continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis."" They noted that there are no unique guidelines for the moral obligation of physicians to care for SARS victims and urged that ""organizations give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic."" They further recommend that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of health care providers during an infectious disease outbreak, and that ""these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics.""

The American Medical Association has addressed the issue of physician obligation in disaster preparedness and response in its Code of Medical Ethics. 13 As part of the ""Opinions on Professional Rights and Responsibilities,"" the Code states: Because of their commitment to care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters. This ethical obligation holds even in the face of greater than usual risks to their own safety, health, or life.

Yet there remains the question of whether physicians in the United States (and specifically otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons) are properly prepared for, and willing to, participate in disaster relief of a significant magnitude, especially when there is grave personal risk. Alexander and associates 14 used a national, cross-sectional, random-sample survey in 2003 to address this issue. Seven hundred forty-four physicians responded to the survey. Only 43% of emergency physicians and 21% of primary care physicians agreed that they were generally well prepared to play a role in responding to a bioterrorism attack. The majority of the respondents believed that disaster preparedness should also include infectious pandemics.

Alexander and Wynia 15 expanded their examination of physicians' feelings about bioterrorism events and their responsibilities to their willingness to treat patients despite personal risk. Eighty percent of respondents reported that they would be willing to treat affected patients in the face of a hypothetical outbreak of an ""unknown but potentially deadly illness.""

Belief in a duty to treat was associated with their willingness to treat patients under conditions of personal risk. The authors concluded that ""the threat of new disease outbreaks, from bioterrorism or natural causes, has provided an opportunity for physicians to rearticulate and reaffirm longstanding ethical principles regarding the duty to treat.""

Making the decision to care for patients in the face of a nuclear, biological, or chemical terrorist attack; an infectious pandemic; or in an isolated hospital in a natural disaster caring for critically ill patients beyond one's area of expertise requires extraordinary commitment and courage. This level of obligation is similar to that emulated by combat medics and military surgeons who care for wounded soldiers on the battlefield under direct fire themselves. There is no higher achievement of moral commitment and professional dedication than this. However, it must be recognized that not all physicians possess the capabilities to administer effective care under such conditions, or at least may not know whether or not they can until the actual event occurs. The AMA Code of Medical Ethics notwithstanding, although it will not be possible to count on every physician to participate in the direct medical care of patients under such conditions, there certainly are other important ways that physicians can be of benefit to the medical disaster relief, such as resource allocation and personnel coordination.

Larkin and Arnold 16 have characterized the extraordinary virtues required of physicians who respond to terrorism events in the face of triage, system overload, and ethical decision making with every patient-""prudence, courage, justice, stewardship, vigilance, resilience, and charity."" These are admirable traits that few of us possess in their entirety. They also raise several issues that need to be discussed and guidelines to be provided before the situations might actually be encountered, including the above seven cardinal virtues: The authors further propose that ""virtue-based ethics are more adaptable to the multiplicity of rapidly changing disaster circumstances than mere principles, rules, and proto-cols, particularly since the scope, magnitude, and dynamics of a particular terrorist challenge cannot be determined in advance."" They applied the seven cardinal virtues to times of terror and how they might be helpful to physicians who find themselves overwhelmed by the tasks at hand in caring for disaster victims. Of these virtues, justice, stewardship, and charity imply a sense of obligation for physicians to attend to the sick and wounded, regardless of personal risk. However, ""virtue-based ethics"" reflects primarily the responsibilities and obligations of physicians to care for victims of such disasters, whereas ""utilitarian-based ethics"" requires physicians to make medical decisions based on the resources available and a triage system that favors applying those resources to victims who are predicted to have the best chance of survival. As with many ethical dilemmas, virtuebased ethics and utilitarian-based ethics may be in opposition, and the solution may lie in identifying the best applicable aspects of both to the situation at hand.

Weapons of mass destruction cause a particularly difficult challenge to physicians because of the dosage-related prognosis for exposed victims and the personal risk to physicians of non-decontaminated patients. Pesik and associates 17 recommend that triage of the victims be ethically based on the medical model of ""best prognosis."" Under this model, the patients are triaged according to their prognosis or survivability. The authors suggested that ""if something cannot be accomplished (i.e., saving all lives with the limited available resources), then there is no ethical obligation to do so."" However, whatever model of triage is used in disaster management, the physician's obligation is to care for patients/victims in such a manner as to provide the most benefit to the most patients. The physician assisting in disaster medical relief must move from doing the most he/she can do for each individual patient to doing what can be done for those who have the best chance for survival. This is a difficult transition, and one that may not be easily made without prior planning and acceptance of a new care model.

In a commentary on US health policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Rosenbaum 18 proposed that the apparent need to improve the public health system in this country to better respond to disasters might also have a positive effect on the just provision of health care for the underserved and low-income population. As exposed by the hurricane effects, the majority of the victims were those who were unable to escape from the flooding, primarily because they lived in the low-income areas adjacent to the levees, as well as not having the transportation capabilities to escape before the hurricane struck. The author admonished that ""the notion that the world's most powerful nation would continue to lurch from disaster to disaster, jury-rigging inadequate and temporary solutions, is simply untenable."" Disasters such as Katrina have the ability to expose the frailties of the medical system, and thus, the potential inability to adequately support the efforts of conscientious physicians who put themselves in harm's way to care for the victims.

If physicians accept the tenet that it is a professional obligation to care for victims of terrorism attacks and extreme natural disasters, then how can the medical profession best prepare physicians for this role? Wynia and Gostin 19 reaffirmed that there is sufficient agreement in the profession for physician obligation to treat in these circumstances. Yet, it does not serve either the physician or the potential victims/ patients well for a physician to be ill prepared to deal with a wide range of nuclear, biological, chemical, infectious, and other medical problems without adequate ethical guidelines. An integral part of such preparation would be the development of ethical guidelines, both principled and practical, emphasized by case-based scenarios, to be a major part of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education.

In a recent study of the self-assessment of public health workers' preparedness for bioterrorism or other public health disasters, the authors identified a wide range of perceived needs for additional training. 20 They suggested using competency-based goals, which would be assessed by drills, exercises, and tests. This approach is not unlike the American graduate medical education system of competencybased learning, with specific goals and objectives. It is possible to apply this system to ethical decision making in disaster medical response, as well.

However, before educational models are developed to teach ethical decision making in disaster medicine, it will be necessary for national discussions to occur, with the development of consensus guidelines across medical and surgical specialties that will encourage both virtue-based ethics as well as the cardinal principles of ethical behavior by physicians. Such guidelines would need to recognize the practical issues of need/prognosis-based triage, both of incoming casualties as well as patients already hospitalized and requiring large amounts of medical resources. Inpatients with do not resuscitate orders and those who are terminally ill would likely be placed in the ""expectant"" category of patients, with the resources currently applied to their care reallocated to incoming patients with a better chance of survival, save for comfort care and pain palliation. Once there is a national consensus within the medical and nursing professions, then the public needs to be educated about the changing requirements for ethical decision making under the dire conditions of disasters. Public education will not completely alleviate controversies and concerns about triage, but it would be quite helpful.

The educational curriculum for ethical decision making in disaster medicine should become a part of the medical school curriculum, as well as for resident physicians in all specialties. Until the students and residents have progressed into practicing physicians, there will be a need to provide continuing medical education courses on this subject for both community and academic physicians, who will bear the responsibility for caring for victims of terrorist attacks and extreme natural disasters. Table 1 is a proposed model curriculum for ethical decision making in disaster medicine.

It is necessary to develop a national consensus on the ethical guidelines for physicians who care for patients, victims, and casualties of disasters, and to formulate a virtue-based, yet practical, ethical approach to medical care under such extreme conditions. An educational curriculum for medical students, residents, and practicing physicians is required to best prepare all physicians who might be called upon, in the future, to triage patients, allocate resources, and make difficult decisions about treatment priorities and comfort care. It is not appropriate to address these questions at the time of the disaster, but rather in advance, as part of the ethics education of the medical profession. Important issues for resolution include inpatient and casualty triage and prioritization, medical liability, altered standards of care, justice and equity, informed consent and patient autonomy, expanding scope of practice in disaster medicine, and the moral and ethical responsibilities of physicians to care for disaster victims.
