The Evolution and Genetics of Virus Host Shifts,"Emerging viral diseases are often the product of a host shift, where a pathogen jumps from its original host into a novel species. Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens, but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously, with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often, pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host, for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors, to escape the immune response, or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this, and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen's fitness, and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring. Here we examine how these evolutionary factors affect patterns of host shifts and disease emergence.","Emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and agriculture are often the result of a pathogen jumping from its original host into a novel host species. This can take the form of spillover events that result in dead end infections or short stuttering transmission chains, or a host shift with successful infection and sustained transmission in the new host (Box 1). Host shifts have resulted in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps [1] and the H1N1 ''Spanish flu'' from birds [2] , which have both killed tens of millions of people. Other important human pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum [3] , SARS coronavirus [4] , Hendra and Nipah viruses [5] , and the measles virus [6] . Past host shifts can be detected when the phylogenies of hosts and their pathogens are different (phylogenetic incongruence-Box 1). This is very common, with a survey of the published literature finding 93% of studies comparing host and pathogen phylogenies showed evidence of host shifts [7] , and there are relatively few cases where the pathogen phylogeny mirrors that of its host completely [8] .

Here we examine the evolutionary factors that affect a pathogen's ability to infect a novel host and then discuss how the ability of a pathogen to adapt to be transmitted efficiently by a novel host can allow its long-term persistence. Following a host shift, selection will favour mutations that allow a pathogen to (a) enter a host cell with greater efficiency and (b) ''fine tune'' or optimise their fitness in the new host, for example by better utilising cellular machinery, enhancing immune avoidance, optimising virulence, and maximising transmission potential. Our focus is on viruses, owing to a wealth of recent studies, and because RNA viruses are the most likely group of pathogens to jump between hosts, possibly because of their ability to rapidly adapt to new hosts [9] [10] [11] [12] . While we focus on genetics in this review, behaviour and ecological processes are clearly a hugely important factor in determining whether a novel host is exposed to a novel pathogen, and whether onward transmission occurs [10, [13] [14] [15] .

The susceptibility of potential hosts varies enormously, and an important predictor of susceptibility is how closely related a novel host is to a pathogen's natural host ( Figure 1A ). This ''phylogenetic distance effect'' has been repeatedly found using experimental cross infections in all major pathogen groups, including studies of fruit flies and viruses [16] , plants and fungi [17, 18] , beetles and Spiroplasma bacteria [19] , insects and Wolbachia [20] , and fruit flies and nematodes [21] . This is presumably because close relatives of the natural host offer a similar environment to that which the pathogen is adapted to. This is likely to be especially important for pathogens because of the myriad of molecular interactions pathogens have with their hosts to infect cells, utilise resources, and avoid or suppress the host immune response.

Reconstructions of host shifts in nature have confirmed that pathogens are more likely to shift between closely related species. By reconstructing the phylogeny of rabies viruses isolated from various species of bat in North America, it has been possible to look at the patterns of cross species transmission in the wild. The rate of cross species transmission was greatest for closely related species [22] whether looking at spillover events (recent infections that might not persist long-term) or host shifts that successfully became established [13] . Similarly, viruses and other parasites of mammals are most likely to be shared by more closely related hosts [10, 23, 24, 25, 26] . Additionally, the phylogenies of hantaviruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts show evidence for host switching, with data suggestive of preferential shifts between closely related species [27] . However, within these examples there are cases of pathogens transferring successfully over great phylogenetic distances [28, 29] .

Closely related species may also have similar levels of susceptibility, regardless of their distance from the pathogen's natural host ( Figure 1B ) [16] , which we call the ''phylogenetic clade effect.'' Such effects could be due to certain host clades having lost or gained immune or cellular components that affect susceptibility to a given pathogen [30] . This may mean that the host phylogeny is a patchwork of clades with varying levels of susceptibility, with clades of susceptible hosts scattered across the tree, sometimes in taxa distantly related to the pathogen's natural host. This has been demonstrated in experimental cross infections of fruit flies and sigma viruses [16] , where after accounting for distance from the viruses' natural hosts, the effect of the host phylogeny explained almost all of the remaining variation in viral load. If this pattern is common, it may explain cases where viruses and other pathogens recurrently shift between distantly related taxa, such as transmission of influenza viruses among birds, pigs, and humans [2] , or human to bovid transmission of Staphylococcus aureus [31] , although host ecology likely also plays a role in these instances.

The strength of these effects of the host phylogeny varies between pathogen groups, with RNA viruses and pathogens that already have a broad host range being particularly prone to jumping between distantly related species [10, 12, 32] .

At the molecular level, the availability of suitable cell surface receptors to allow viruses to enter cells may be a cause of phylogenetic effects on host shifts. For example, the ability of an avian influenza virus to infect a host is initially, at least partly, determined by the presence and within-host distribution of a2,3-linked host sialic acid (SA) receptors [33] .

Some pathogens may already be pre-adapted to a novel host, but specific mutations are often required to enhance a pathogen's fitness in the new host if it is to establish successfully. A diversity of traits may change to adapt the pathogen to its new host, such as the efficiency of replication, and avoidance or suppression of host immunity, but the binding of host cell receptors is commonly especially important.

In bacteriophage (viruses of bacteria), mutations that enhance a virus' ability to bind to host cells are important in determining a virus' ability to infect a host. One mechanism is spontaneous mutations, which typically change host range by altering amino acid sequences in host-binding proteins, including tail fibres and capsid proteins [34, 35] . Similarly, experimentally evolved phage selected to infect previously resistant bacterial genotypes or different bacterial lineages also acquire mutations in genes encoding host-binding proteins [36] [37] [38] .

In vertebrates, the importance of receptors is supported by an analysis of 64 human viruses, which found that those with the broadest host range used receptors whose amino acid sequences are the most conserved [39] . Furthermore, changes in the ability to bind host cells can also be essential for host shifts by viruses of vertebrates. This is the case for the influenza virus, which binds to sialic acid receptors, of which there are two basic types (SAa-2,3-and SAa-2,6-Gal-terminated saccharides) [33] . Avian influenza viruses bind SAa-2,3 receptors in the respiratory The pathogen is less successful in host clades more distantly related to its natural host. (B) ''Patches'' of highly susceptible-or highly resistant-clades of hosts, may be scattered across the host phylogeny independently from their distance from the natural host. All of the species in the clade labelled ''a'' are equally distantly related from the pathogen's natural host. However, the species in the clade marked ''b'' are highly susceptible, despite being distantly related to the natural host. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g001 Box 1. Glossary Host shift. We define a host shift as a parasite shifting to infect a new species of host. Spillover infection. An infection that results in a deadend infection with no onward transmission or a stuttering chain of limited transmission in the new host. Phylogenetic incongruence. If the topologies of host and parasite phylogenies are not the same, it suggests that the parasites have switched between host species during their evolution. Clade. A group of related species with the same common ancestor (they are monophyletic). and gastrointestinal tracts of birds. Conversely, human seasonal influenza viruses predominantly bind to SAa-2,6 receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans. However, humans possess SAa-2,3-sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Though it is relatively difficult for influenza viruses to get into and out of the lower respiratory tract, avian influenza viruses do occasionally infect humans. Such infections typically result in severe disease with little or no secondary transmission. Successful adaptation to humans requires mutations to the SA receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin gene that allow the virus to utilise SAa-2,6 receptors and thus increase the potential for efficient transmission between humans [33] . A related example of the importance of changes in receptor binding is the switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs, which was due to two mutations in the viral capsid gene that allow it to bind the canine transferrin receptor [40] . Table 1 . Factors that evolutionary theory predicts will affect the likelihood that the correct set of mutations will arise to adapt a pathogen to a new host.

Factors favouring a host shift

The fewer mutations required to adapt to a new host, the more likely it is that they will all occur Epistasis and mutation order If mutations have to occur in particular combinations to confer high fitness, then the chances of adaptation may be reduced Mutational target size If many different sites in the genome can be mutated to adapt to a new host, then the correct mutations are more likely to occur

Trade-offs If mutations reduce other components of a pathogen's fitness, such as replication in alternative hosts, they may be less likely to spread in the pathogen population.

Mutation rate High per nucleotide mutation rates increase the chance of specific mutations occurring, but can also slow rates of adaptation as many mutations are deleterious

Recombination rate Genetic exchange, such as the exchange of plasmids, homologous recombination, and the reassortment of viral genomes, can allow the acquisition of adaptations to new hosts Effective population size (N e ) Natural selection is more effective when the effective population size is large, and large N e populations generally have more standing genetic variation, which can accelerate adaptation Generation time Short generation times can increase rates of adaptation Such theoretical predictions as listed above have been shown to be important for adaptation per se [87] , and these population genetic parameters will also be important in determining the ability of a pathogen to adapt to a novel host. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.t001 The virus naturally infects Hibiscus plants, but following five passages in an alternate host, (Chenopodium quinoa) the same eight mutations repeatedly occur [57] . (B) Parallel genetic changes in codon 30 of the gag gene (Met to Arg) following three independent transfers of SIVcpz into humans [59] . When a chimp was subsequently infected with HIV-1, the residue reverted back to Met. The coloured blocks represent either a Met (yellow) or Arg (blue) at codon position 30 in the HIV gag gene. (C) Parallel changes in protein function following independent transfers of SIVs from chimpanzees (HIV-1) and sooty mangabeys (HIV-2) into humans. SIV Nef protein does not antagonise tetherin in humans, and so other HIV proteins have evolved the ability to antagonise tetherin [64] . The exception to this is HIV-1 group O viruses, which do not appear to have evolved anti-tetherin activity. In HIV-1 group N viruses the evolution of antitetherin activity in Vpu may have come at a cost, as Vpu no longer degrades CD4 receptors to aid the release of viral particles [61] . The coloured gene names in the schematic represent the gene that provides the anti-tetherin function in that host and viral lineage. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g002

If pathogens need to adapt for a host shift to be successful, then the risk of a host shift will depend on the likelihood that the necessary set of mutations can accumulate in the newly infected host (Table 1 ). If specific new mutations are essential for survival in a novel host, high mutation rates may be especially advantageous [41] . Accordingly, the high mutation rate of RNA viruses may explain why they host shift more frequently than other pathogens [12] . However, most mutations will be deleterious or lethal [42, 43] , so the chances of a host shift will be maximised at an intermediate mutation rate [41, 44] (although it has been shown in a plant virus that the fraction of mutations that are deleterious can be reduced in a novel host [45] ). How close the mutation rate of different pathogen groups is to this optimum for host shifting is unclear, so it is uncertain whether high mutation rates can explain why RNA viruses frequently jump between species.

The probability of a host shift will also depend on the number of mutations required to adapt to novel hosts. At one extreme, a single mutation allowed Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to replicate efficiently in horses when it switched from rodents in the early 1990s [46] . Similarly, single mutations can underlie the expansion of the host range of RNA phages [47] . In contrast, five amino acid changes are predicted to be required for some Avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses to acquire the ability to be transmitted between ferrets [48] . If multiple mutations are required to successfully host shift, their availability can impose a constraint on host range evolution. This is illustrated by experiments on a DNA phage of Pseudomonas fluorescens [36] . The phage rapidly evolved to infect certain host genotypes but never adapted to others. The successful shifts were associated with one to three mutations in genes affecting host binding, whilst more mutations were required to infect the other hosts (these could be acquired through a process of coevolution; see below).

If multiple mutations are required, then the number of ways that the mutations might be fixed is important; are mutations adaptive in all genetic backgrounds, or does fitness epistasis require that they fix simultaneously or in a particular order? There Each column shows the presence of a different pathogen, with a coloured circle representing the presence of that pathogen. In panel A, pathogens preferentially shift between closely related hosts, while in B closely related host species have similar levels of susceptibility to infection, regardless of the source of the pathogen (with two increases in host resistance occurring at the asterisks on the host phylogeny). Both processes result in closely related host species harbouring similar pathogens, and in some host clades harbouring more pathogen species. However, in A, but not B, host species with more close relatives tend to have more pathogens. For example, the phylogenetically isolated species at the bottom of the tree is not infected by any of the three pathogens in A, but is in B. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004395.g003

have been several outbreaks of Chikungunya virus linked to the virus shifting from being predominantly vectored by the mosquito Aedes aegypti to Aedes albopictus. A single amino acid change adapts the virus to the new vector [49] , but despite A. albopictus being common in Asia, this mutation did not occur for 60 years, and when it did, it was in a Chikungunya virus lineage of African origin. Here, the host shift mutation had no effect in the genetic background of the Asian strains, due to an epistatic interaction with a single amino acid difference elsewhere in the genome [49] .

The likelihood that the mutations required to adapt to a novel host occur will also depend on the size of the mutational target in the pathogen-the number of different potential changes in the pathogen genome that adapt it to the new host. In some viruses it is common to see the same parallel mutations occurring each time a virus adapts to a particular host species [50, 51] , suggesting there may be limited molecular solutions to infecting a new host species (i.e., the more parallel changes observed, the smaller the mutational target). This may act as a significant constraint on host shifts by reducing the supply of adaptive mutations.

The size of the mutational target has been most studied in phage, where host adaptation can be highly parallel, such that the same mutations become fixed in independent replicate populations [51, 52] . The importance of these mutations is illustrated by experiments that ''rewind the evolutionary tape'' by adapting hostshifted phages back onto the ancestral host and observe reversion mutations restoring the sequence back to the ancestral state [38] . When 40 host range mutants of phi6 phage were isolated, it was found that there were 17 unique mutations underlying this shift [35] . Furthermore, it was estimated that 56 different mutations in the phage genome have the potential to adapt it to the novel host [35] . Therefore, despite some parallelism, in this case the size of the mutational target is significant, but the possible number of combinations is large, so genetic constraints on this host shift are relatively weak. Parallel evolution at the molecular level is also common in experiments using viruses of eukaryotes (Figure 2A) . When vesicular stomatitis virus is evolved in human or dog cells, parallel mutations tend to occur within the same cell type [50] . Similarly in plants, experimental evolution of Tobacco etch potyvirus on four host species found that parallel mutations only occurred when viruses were passaged in the same host species [53] . A number of other studies in plants have found parallel mutations occurring, often after only a few passages on the novel host [54] [55] [56] [57] . Experimental studies finding parallel mutations often enforce transmission and so bypass the critical barrier of successful transmission in the new host. Therefore, looking at the mutations that occur in chains of natural transmission is an important future direction, as, for example, the size of the mutational target may be different for cell entry compared to transmission [58] .

Host shifts into humans have also involved parallel mutations ( Figure 2B ). In HIV-1, codon 30 of the gag gene has independently undergone the same change in all three human lineages of the virus that transferred from chimps [1] . This change increases viral replication rate in human cells [59] , and when a chimp was infected with HIV-1 it reverted to the residue seen in SIVcpz [59] . Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in two independent epidemics of SARs coronavirus following the shift from palm civets to humans [60] .

Parallel phenotypic changes may sometimes have different solutions at the molecular level. This has occurred in different HIV lineages that shifted into humans from other primates ( Figure 2C ). HIV-1 group M, which is responsible for the global pandemic, arose following a host shift by the chimpanzee virus SIVcpz [1] . In both human and chimp cells a restriction factor called tetherin can prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells [61] . In chimps, the SIVcpz protein Nef has anti-tetherin activity, but this is ineffective in humans due to a deletion in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin that is targeted by Nef. Instead, in HIV-1 group M, the Vpu protein has evolved to perform the same function [61] . This was paralleled in HIV-2, which originates from sooty mangabeys ( Figure 2C ). The sooty mangabey virus also uses Nef as a tetherin antagonist and again this is ineffective in humans, but in this case the function has been acquired by the Env protein (HIV-2 lacks the Vpu protein) [61] .

In cases where mutational targets are small and multiple mutations are required, several factors may help overcome mutational constraint and allow host shifts to occur. For example, the ability of avian influenza to establish infections in the eyes and lower respiratory tract of humans [33] may give time and sufficient population size for the mutations that facilitate efficient human-tohuman transmission to arise. In laboratory studies of interactions between DNA phage and bacteria, it has been found that reciprocal coevolution allows phage to build up broad host ranges through the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations in genes associated with host binding [36] . Additionally pathogens may circulate in host populations at low levels before becoming a detectable outbreak, and this may provide time for the pathogen to evolve adaptations to optimise its fitness in the novel host [62] .

The number and taxonomic diversity of pathogens infecting each host species is different, and the processes that shape the composition of these pathogen communities are poorly understood. The distribution of pathogens across host species is the consequence of a balance between the rate at which new host-pathogen associations are ''born'' following host shifts (or speciation) and ''die'' when the pathogen goes extinct in a host [24, 85, 86] . If host shifts occur far more frequently than host speciation, then the process is similar to the theory of island biogeography, where species richness of island communities is a balance between the rate at which new species colonise the island and existing species go extinct [88] . Therefore, this hypothesis predicts that species that have properties that increase the rate that pathogens host shift will tend to harbour more pathogens. Because host shifts tend to occur most readily between related species, on the rare occasions a host acquires a pathogen from a distant relative (Figure 1 ), that pathogen may then rapidly jump into other closely related hosts. This process can generate a clumped distribution of pathogens, where related hosts share related pathogens ( Figure 3A ) [24, 85] . Furthermore, phylogenetically isolated hosts that have few close relatives are predicted to have fewer pathogens, and their pathogen communities may be dominated by classes of pathogens such as RNA viruses that are prone to move between distantly related hosts. Alternatively, the host phylogeny may consist of clades of intrinsically resistant and susceptible species, and the resistant clades will tend to have lower pathogen diversity ( Figure 3B ). These processes have been little studied for pathogens [24] , but support comes from plant feeding insects, which have lower species richness on phylogenetically isolated hosts [89] . This conceptual framework combined with our understanding of host shifts may prove to be a powerful way to explain the community composition of pathogens.

Adapting to a new host may have deleterious effects on other pathogen traits, and such trade-offs may reduce the chances of a host shift occurring. A possible example of this is seen in the shift of HIV-1 from chimpanzees to humans. HIV-1 group M and HIV-1 group N have independently shifted from chimpanzees to humans [1] , and in both cases the Vpu protein has evolved to antagonise the restriction factor tetherin (see above). Vpu also binds and degrades CD4 receptors in SIV to aid the release of viral particles [63] , but this function has been lost in group N viruses, possibly as a pleiotropic consequence of the protein gaining anti-tetherin activity [64] . It has been speculated that this may explain why HIV group N has remained a rare pathogen in Africa, while HIV group M-where the ability to degrade CD4 was retained-has become a pandemic [64] .

A common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts is that performance on the original host is reduced. For example, host range mutations in the P3 protein of the RNA phage phi6 generally reduce growth on the ancestral host, although rare, costfree mutations do exist [35, 65] . Observations of similar effects in other phage suggest that this may be a general property of phage host range expansion [38, 66] . Similar patterns have been observed following virus adaptation to different cell culture types [67, 68] , plant species [54, 55] , and animal species [69] . For example, in a host switch of parvoviruses from cats to dogs, the virus responsible for the initial outbreak in dogs (CPV-2) lost the ability to infect cats, although this was later regained [40] .

Once a pathogen has infected a new host, the long-term success of the host shift can be independent of reduced performance in the original host if the pathogen does not require transmission to and from the original host for survival. However, trade-offs between performance in the two hosts can prevent adaptation to a new host if the pathogen is transmitted back to the original host at a high rate. For example, a vector borne pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one as it will normally end up back in the original mosquito vector. In contrast, directly transmitted pathogens like influenza may be able to establish a continuous transmission chain in the new host, so reduced performance on the original host is not important.

Another important trade-off in the novel host may be between virulence (the harm a pathogen does to a host) and the transmission potential of the pathogen. A number of theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that an intermediate level of virulence is often optimal to maximise transmission [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . However, following a host shift, a pathogen may produce maladaptive levels of virulence as the novel host-parasite association has not been under direct selection. For example, when the myxoma virus from South American Sylvilagus rabbits was transferred to European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), initial case mortality rates were as high as 99.8% in Australia. The rapid mortality is thought to have reduced the window of time that rabbits were able to transmit the virus, and as a consequence virulence rapidly dropped to case mortality rates of ,90% due to the spread of attenuated virus strains [75, 76] . There appear to be large mutational targets to evolve changes in virulence in the myxoma virus (a DNA virus with a large 162 kb genome), with no mutations common to specific virulence grades [77] . Failure to evolve lower levels of virulence may explain the stuttering chains of transmission seen in some spillover events [78, 79] ; however, it is difficult to disentangle whether the low rates of transmission are due to maladaptive levels of virulence or from human intervention.

One aim of studying host shifts is to predict future disease emergence, but it is unclear whether this will ever be possible with an accuracy that makes it practically useful [80] . While we have rules of thumb as to which groups of pathogens are most likely to host shift, and which donor species they are likely to come from [32] , there will always be exceptions. This means that predicting disease emergence by fine scale surveillance of potential donor species and the individuals they are most likely to infect is a hugely difficult task [81] . The observation that specific mutations are often required in host shifts has led to studies looking at whether these mutations can be predicted in advance. For H5N1 avian influenza viruses, mammalian transmissible forms have been evolved in laboratory settings, and identified mutations may be markers for potential epidemics [82] [83] [84] . However, even in this exceptionally well-studied case, predictive power remains low and highly system specific.

While we increasingly understand the genetic details that underlie host shifts, there are still important questions unanswered. The literature is overwhelmingly skewed towards viruses, but do bacterial and eukaryotic parasites have similar properties? Under what conditions do trade-offs between performance on the original and new host prevent host shifts from happening? Do the mutations involved in host shifts originate as de novo mutations in the new host or come from standing variation in the original host? What determines the size of the mutational target, and does this depend on what the barrier to a host shift is? For example, mutational targets seem to be small for relatively simple traits like changes in receptor use, but may be larger for complex traits like virulence and transmissibility.

One little-explored consequence of host shifts is how they affect the distribution of pathogens across host species [85] . The number and type of pathogens infecting a host is partly a result of past ''acquisitions'' following host shifts (Box 2), and new theory is showing how our understanding of host shifts can allow us to understand the composition of pathogen communities [24, 86] , but these ideas remain largely untested.

Finding tractable methods to monitor emerging diseases presents a significant challenge for the future. Studying the genetics of host shifts has the potential to uncover the evolutionary processes that pathogens undergo when they find themselves in a novel host, and may allow us to begin to address this challenge.

viruses The Broad Host Range and Genetic Diversity of Mammalian and Avian Astroviruses,"Astroviruses are a diverse family of viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts. Here we describe the phylogenetic diversity and current classification methodology of astroviruses based on the ORF1b and ORF2 genes, highlighting the propensity of astroviruses to undergo interspecies transmission and genetic recombination which greatly increase diversity and complicate attempts at a unified and comprehensive classification strategy.","Astroviruses (AstVs) were first described in 1975 as small viruses that are 28-30 nm in diameter with icosahedral morphology. Astroviruses are named due to the distinct five-pointed or six-pointed star-like appearance of some virions when visualized under an electron microscope (EM); astrovirus is derived from the Greek word astron meaning star [1] [2] [3] . Astroviruses were first described from human infants with diarrhea and were subsequently identified in the young of numerous mammalian and avian species [4, 5] .

Human astroviurses (HAstVs) have been recognized as one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in children, associated with 2-8% of infections [6] . Transmission of HAstV occurs via the fecal-oral route, person-to-person contact, or contaminated food or water. Following an incubation period of 3-4 days, symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever are often reported [7, 8] . Whilst primarily associated with asymptomatic or diarrheal disease in humans, there are several reports of central nervous system (CNS) complications such as acute flaccid paralysis [9] , meningitis, and encephalitis [10, 11] . Animal astroviurses, have been isolated from numerous mammalian and avian species. In animals, astrovirus infection may be asymptomatic or associated with enteric disease and a range of other symptoms indicative of the involvement of other organ systems including hepatitis and nephritis in avian species [12, 13] , and neurological symptoms in cattle [14] [15] [16] and mink [17] .

Astroviruses are classified within the unassigned Astroviridae family and are non-enveloped viruses characterized by a positive sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome 6.4-7.9 kb long comprised of a 5 -untranslated region (UTR), three open reading frames (ORFs)-ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2, a 3 -UTR, and a poly A tail [18] . The ORF1a region encodes a non-structural polyprotein (serine protease), ORF1b encodes a polyprotein including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein [18] . A further ORF, termed ORFX, has been observed in classic HAstVs and some mammalian astroviurses, overlapping the 5 end of ORF2 which may be translated through a leaking scanning mechanism [19] . Astroviruses exhibit several distinctive features in addition to a distinctive morphology. The viruses lack a RNA-helicase domain encoded within the genome and utilize a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to translate the RdRp, which distinguishes the Astroviridae family from other non-enveloped ssRNA virus families such as Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae [20, 21] . The greatest diversity in the genome is within the ORF2 region, which is characterized by a highly-conserved N-terminal domain (amino acids (aa) 1-424), a hypervariable domain (aa 425-688) which is believed to form the capsid spike and contribute to receptor binding, and a highly acidic C-terminal domain [22, 23] .

The wide host range of astroviruses and the high degree of genetic diversity present within the Astroviridae family have complicated attempts at a unified classification method. Astroviruses are classified within the unassigned Astroviridae family, which was initially comprised of a single genus (Astrovirus) based on virion morphology [18] . The classification of the Astrovirus genus within the family Astroviridae was recognized by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 1995 and the classification scheme has been modified numerous times over the intervening years [24] . In 2004, two genera were recognized; Mamastrovirus (MAstV) and Avastrovirus (AAstV), that were known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively, and viruses were classified solely on the species of origin [24] . However, the advent of sequence based characterization rendered this approach inadequate, revealing that viruses isolated from different species can be genetically similar (reflecting prevalent interspecies transmission of viruses) and also revealing a large range of diversity of viruses within a single host species. With this in mind, the classification system proposed by the ICTV Astroviridae Study Group in 2010 recommended classification based on the amino acid sequence of the ORF2 genome region, recommending that different strains of the same astrovirus species should share >75% identity in the capsid proteins [25] . Additionally, there are proposals to define distinct variants within a recognized astrovirus species, with a variant defined as sharing <93-95% nucleotide similarity to the reference or prototype strain of each species or if phylogenetic analysis is used, a distance of >0.05 based on analysis of the capsid protein [12, 18] .

Astroviruses within the Mamastrovirus genus are derived from numerous mammalian species in addition to humans (HAstV), including farmed species such as pigs (PAstV), sheep (OAstV), cattle (BoAstV), domesticated animals including cats (FAstV), and dogs (CaAstV), rodents and small mammals including mink (MiAstV), bats (BAstV), rats (RAstV), mice, rabbit (RabAstV), fox, marmot (HHMastV), porcupine, shrew, vole, and larger species including deer (CcAstV), monkeys, water buffalo (BufAstV), yak, camel (DcAstV), and cheetah (ChAstV) (Figure 1a,b) . Viruses from the Mamastrovirus genus have also been characterized from marine mammals including stellar sea lion (SslAstV) and California sea lions (CslAstV), minke whale, orca whale, and bottlenose dolphins (BdAstV) (Figure 1a ,b) [26] . The current ICTV classification reveals 19 recognized species of Mamastrovirus (MAstV-1-19) within two genogroups GI and GII; Mamastrovirus 1 (GI.A-human); Mamastrovirus 2 (GI.B-feline); Mamastrovirus 3 (GI.C-porcine); Mamastrovirus 4 (GI.D-California sea lion); Mamastrovirus 5 (GI.E-canine); Mamastrovirus 6 (GI.F-human); Mamastrovirus 7 (GI.G-bottlenose dolphin); Mamastrovirus 8 (GII.A-human); Mamastrovirus 9 (GII.B-human); Mamastrovirus 10 (GII.C-mink); Mamastrovirus 11 (GII.D-California sea lion), Mamastrovirus 12 (GII.E-bat); Mamastrovirus 13 (GII.F-ovine); and Mamastroviruses 14-19 (GII.G to GII.L-bat species), and numerous other strains awaiting classification, some of which are considered as tentative new species (designated by a ∧ symbol in the phylogenetic trees) (Figure 1a ) [27, 28] . Viruses from the Avastrovirus genus have been characterized from numerous farmed avian species including turkeys (TAstV), ducks (DAstV), chicken (CAstV), guineafowl (GFAstV), pigeon (PiAstV), goose, as well as wild aquatic and terrestrial birds including heron, doves, penguins, and many other species (Figure 2a) . The three species originally recognized within the genus were Avastrovirus GI.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1), Avastrovirus GI.B comprised of avian nephritis virus 1 (ANV-1), avian nephritis virus 2 (ANV-2), and Avastrovirus GII.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) and duck astrovirus DAstV/C-NGB [25] . Avastrovirus GI.A, Avastrovirus GI.B, and Avastrovirus GII.A were renamed Avastrovirus 1 (AAstV-1), Avastrovirus 2 (AAstV-2), and Avastrovirus 3 (AAstV-3), respectively [25] . Viruses from the Avastrovirus genus have been characterized from numerous farmed avian species including turkeys (TAstV), ducks (DAstV), chicken (CAstV), guineafowl (GFAstV), pigeon (PiAstV), goose, as well as wild aquatic and terrestrial birds including heron, doves, penguins, and many other species (Figure 2a) . The three species originally recognized within the genus were Avastrovirus GI.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1), Avastrovirus GI.B comprised of avian nephritis virus 1 (ANV-1), avian nephritis virus 2 (ANV-2), and Avastrovirus GII.A comprised of turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) and duck astrovirus DAstV/C-NGB [25] . Avastrovirus GI.A, Avastrovirus GI.B, and Avastrovirus GII.A were renamed Avastrovirus 1 (AAstV-1), Avastrovirus 2 (AAstV-2), and Avastrovirus 3 (AAstV-3), respectively [25] . Currently, classification into species is based on the phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the full length ORF2 region of the genome that encodes the capsid. However, the limited number of capsid sequences available compared to RdRp sequences makes consistent classification difficult, especially with some novel viruses incompletely sequenced. There are numerous unclassified astroviruses, particularly isolated from aquatic and terrestrial wild birds which, according to the ICTV, are ""related viruses which may be members of the Avastrovirus genus but have not been approved as species"" [18] .

Astrovirus infection in humans has been primarily associated with diarrhea and vomiting, accounting for up to 10% of sporadic gastroenteritis cases in some regions [29] . CNS complications associated with astrovirus infection have been reported in recent years, including acute flaccid paralysis, with some fatalities reported in children with underlying immune disorders [30, 31] .

Historically human astroviruses (HAstV) were classified into five serotypes in 1984 [32] . Subsequent molecular characterization based on viral reactivity to polyclonal antibodies and nucleotide sequence analysis led to the recognition of eight serotypes (HAstV-1-8), now termed ""classic"" HAstV [18, 33, 34] . The relatively recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) and metagenomic analysis has led to the identification of numerous novel strains considered ""non-classic"" HAstV [18] . Currently, HAstVs are classified within the species MAstV-1 (HAstV-1-8), MAstV-6 (MLB1-3), MAstV-8 (VA2/HMO-A, VA4, VA5, BF34), and MAstV-9 (VA1/HMO-C, VA3/HMO-B) [18] (Figure 1a ).

The MAstV-1 species is comprised of HAstV-1-8, and surveillance has revealed that HAstV-1 is the most commonly detected type in children, followed by HAstV-2-5, whereas HAstV-6-8 have been rarely detected [35] . HAstV-4 and HAstV-8 have been associated with infection of older children and longer duration of diarrhea (>7 days) [36, 37] . A HAstV-4 strain was also isolated from an infant with fatal meningoencephalitis [30] . Based upon the phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 region, different lineages within each HAstV type have been proposed; HAstV-1 (HAstV-1a-d) and HAstV-2 (HAstV-2a-d) have been divided into four lineages, whereas HAstV-3 (HAstV-3a-b) and HAstV-4 (HAstV-4a-c) have been classified into two and three lineages, respectively [38] .

The first ""non-classic"" HAstV strain characterized was MLB1, the virus was detected in a stool sample from a 3 year old Australian child with acute diarrhea in 1999; the child had previously received a liver transplant [39] . The majority of MLB1 strains characterized to date have been detected in India, Kenya, and Japan with limited detected in the USA, China, Bhutan, Egypt, Brazil, and Italy and prevalence has been reported in the range of 0.2% to 9% [40] . However, a seroepidemiologic study in the USA revealed that primary exposure to MLB1 occurs in childhood and that seropositivity reached 100% by adulthood suggesting the widespread circulation of the virus in the human population [41] . MLB2 viruses were first identified in Vellore, India [42] with the majority of strains subsequently identified in Japan, The Gambia, and Switzerland with limited detection in Turkey, USA, Kenya, China, and Thailand and prevalence reported in the range of 0.3% to 1.5% [40] . MLB2 has been associated with meningitis and other CNS complications and has been detected in immunocompromised children [10] . MLB3 viruses were first detected in India in 2004 [43] , with subsequent detection in Kenya and The Gambia and the prevalence in stools ranges from 0.6% to 3.1% [40, 44] .

There is a dual naming system for some HAstV species due to the simultaneous characterization of these viruses by different researchers; these viruses are termed VA/HMO named for VA-Virginia and HMO-Human-Mink-Ovine-like viruses, due to their genetic relatedness to previously characterized mink and sheep viruses [9] . In 2009, VA2/HMO-A strains were detected in children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis in Nigeria, Pakistan [9] , and India [42] . The prevalence of VA2/HMO-A viruses in stools ranges from 0.3% to 2.3%, with strains also detected in Egypt, Japan, USA, Kenya, and China [40] . VA4 has only been detected in Nepal [43] and the BF34 strain has only detected in Burkina Faso [45] .

The VA3/HMO-B viruses were first identified in Vellore, India [42] with sporadic detection in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Nepal with prevalence ranging from 0.1% to 2.3% [40] . VA1/HMO-C viruses were first detected in 2009 during an outbreak of diarrhea in children in Virginia, USA [46] . VA1/HMO-C viruses have been detected and associated with encephalitis in immunocompromized children and adults [11, 40, 47] and acute respiratory disease [48] . The prevalence of VA1/HMO-C viruses in stools ranges from 0.2% to 1.6% in diarrheic and non-diarrheic subjects worldwide, with limited detection in Nepal, Japan, Tanzania, The Gambia, France, and the U.K. [9, 44, 47] . Seroprevalence of VA1/HMO-C has been reported at 65% in adults [49] .

The divergent human astrovirus-like virus tentatively named Bastrovirus was isolated from patients in The Netherlands. The capsid region is homologous to the capsid of HAstV whilst the RdRp region is more closely related to members of the Hepeviridae family. This virus remains to be classified by the ICVT, however the capsid regions clusters closest to the MLB1-3 viruses suggesting an evolutionary relationship to these divergent human astroviruses [50] (Figure 1a ). Revealing the geographic and host diversity of this virus, divergent Bastrovirus strains have also been isolated from bat, pig, and rat species in Vietnam, forming a distinct cluster of strains that also await classification (Figure 1a ).

Mamastroviruses are capable of infecting a wide range of mammalian species including companion animals (cats and dogs), intensively farmed species (pigs and cattle), as well as terrestrial and aquatic wild mammalian species. Unexpectedly there is no clear clustering of viruses separated by hosts of terrestrial or aquatic origins (Figure 1a,b) . In addition to the classified MAstV species, there are numerous divergent viruses isolated from diverse species which likely represent new species awaiting formal classification (Figure 1a ) [51] .

Not surprisingly, domesticated animals such as cats and dogs harbor astrovirus strains more closely related to HAstV than the viruses harboured by many other animal species. Feline astrovirus was first identified in 1981, and feline strains form a small discrete cluster defined as the species MAstV-2, closely related to the human strains comprising the species MAstV-1 [52] (Figure 1a ). Based on evolutionary analysis, an interspecies transmission pathway has been hypothesised whereby porcine strains may have been transmitted to cats and subsequently to humans, possibly involving other intermediary species suggesting sustained interspecies transmission events [53] . Characterization of an outbreak of diarrhea in a group of captive cheetahs in a breeding facility identified an astrovirus strain most closely related to feline strains (Figure 1a ), however it is not clear if this is a recent transmission from domesticated cats or if the virus is circulating independently in cheetahs [54] . Despite dogs also being a companion animal, canine astrovirus, first described in the 1980s, are not as closely related to human strains as feline strains appear to be, based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1a,b) . Canine strains form a small, discrete cluster comprising species MAstV-5, within a lineage comprised of dolphin and sea lion clades representing species MAstV-4 and -11 [55, 56] , and feline, porcine, and human strains are more distantly related within the same lineage (Figure 1a) .

A large diverse lineage, largely comprised of unclassified viruses or tentatively classified viruses awaiting approval encompasses divergent marmot and rabbit strains (MAstV-23), small, discrete clusters of porcine/ovine/bovine strains (MAstV-24), divergent rat strains (MAstV-25), and unclassified mouse and mink strains forming a small discrete cluster (Figure 1a) . Numerous porcine strains also cluster within this lineage; PAstV comprise Mamastrovirus 3 and were first detected by EM in pigs in the U.K. and the USA [57] , and are now recognized to have worldwide distribution [12] . There is a high prevalence of astrovirus detection in pigs, up to 80% in some studies, suggesting that pigs may be persistently infected with various strains of PAstV [58] . There are five recognized lineages (PAstV1-5) reflecting the diversity of strains, suggesting swine are highly permissive to astrovirus infection often without symptoms of disease (Figure 1a,b) . This diversity likely reflects the varying origins of these viruses, in particular highlighting frequent interspecies transmission and recombination events [58] [59] [60] . A study in the USA revealed the high level of co-infections in pigs (13.9%), revealing the frequent opportunity for recombination, especially between viruses of different lineages [61] . The close clustering between some porcine and humans strains, in particular MAstV-3 and MAstV-1 viruses, reflects the close contact between these species with the close sharing of environments and co-housing documented in some countries facilitating frequent interspecies transmission [62] . Wild boars showing no symptoms of enteric disease, housed in a captive breeding park with no contact with domesticated pigs, were found to harbor astrovirus strains with a high degree of genetic similarity to porcine strains comprising MAstV-26 and suggests that the virus may be derived from commonly circulating porcine strains [63] (Figure 1a,b) . Porcupine strains isolated in China also cluster with unclassified PAstV-2 strains suggesting further interspecies transmission of these viruses (Figure 1a ) [64] .

Unexpectedly, limited astrovirus strains have been isolated from sheep. Ovine astrovirus was first identified by EM in 1977 [4] , and OAstV-1 clusters with bovine strains comprising MAstV-13 and a second strain from a healthy sheep characterized in 2009, OAstV-2, clusters with porcine and bovine strains comprising MAstV-24 [65] (Figure 1a) . Similarly, astroviruses are not associated with a significant burden of diarrheal disease in bovine species. The first bovine astrovirus was detected in England in 1978 [66] and bovine astrovirus strains have been detection in association with neurological disease, including encephalitis (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) [14] [15] [16] [67] [68] [69] and diarrheal disease in calves in South Korea [70] and cattle and buffalo calves in China [71] . Two serotypes were previously recognized, BoAstV-1 and BoAstV-2 [72] , however based on phylogenetic analysis there are multiple lineages of BoAstV strains circulating in farmed bovine populations, and the close clustering of bovine, porcine, and ovine strains in multiple lineages reflects the common interspecies transmission events that occur between farmed animals (Figure 1a,b) . Phylogenetic analysis also reveals that bovine-like astrovirus strains have been isolated from numerous wild species including water buffalo, yak, and European roe deer (CcAstV-1 and CcAstV-2) suffering from gastroenteritis [73] . Unclassified astroviruses from dromedary camels (DcAstV) [27] also cluster in a lineage comprised of porcine and bovine strains, further suggesting multiple interspecies transmission events (Figure 1a) . Substantial astrovirus strain diversity has been observed in small mammals, primarily rodents and bats, forming both species-specific clusters reflecting endemic transmission and co-clustering of strains with other host species reflecting widespread interspecies transmission (Figure 1a,b) . Novel murine astrovirus strains have been isolated from laboratory mice in the USA and Japan [74, 75] . Divergent viruses have also been detected, such as those detected in rats (MAstV-25), highlighting the need for more detailed detection and characterization of these viruses to better understand the role these animals play in astrovirus transmission between varied species. One of the mammalian species with the highest burden of symptomatic astrovirus infection is mink; infection is associated with pre-weaning diarrhea syndrome and the neurological condition ""shaking mink syndrome"" [17, 76] . Mink viruses cluster within multiple lineages suggesting that the species is permissive to infection with multiple, diverse lineages of viruses (Figure 1a) . Bat astroviruses were first detected in 2008 in Hong Kong [77] and subsequently detected in bats in China [78, 79] , North America [80] , Germany [81] , Hungary [82] , and the Czech Republic [83] from numerous bat species, with detection rates ranging from 36% to 100% in Miniopterus magnater bats and from 50% to 70% of Miniopterus pusillus bats sampled in Hong Kong [77] . A diverse population of viruses appears to be highly prevalent in bats without causing disease [12] (Figures 1 and 2) . The majority of bat astroviruses are divergent from other characterized mammalian astroviruses, and display a high degree of genetic diversity forming numerous recognized and proposed species (Figure 1a) . Some bat sequences clustered with strains from other species including fox, cattle, and mice, suggesting that bats are highly permissive to infection with diverse astrovirus strains from multiple hosts and play a key role in astrovirus diversity and interspecies transmission (Figure 1a,b) .

Astroviruses have been detected in aquatic mammalian species including Californian sea lions, Steller sea lion, bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, and minke whale [26] . The strains from these aquatic species do not cluster together, instead forming multiple discrete clusters, suggesting several transmission events from terrestrial mammals to aquatic mammals (Figure 1a) . Minke whale and BdAstV-3 strains are divergent to characterized astrovirus strains, with BdAstV-1 strains comprising MAstV-7 and a diverse group of sea lion viruses comprising the MAstV-4 cluster with porcine and canine strains (Figure 1a ).

There are numerous divergent strains that are yet to be classified that may reflect interspecies transmission events. A single divergent feline strain along with a fox strain cluster within a diverse lineage comprised of human HMO strains (MAstV-8 and -9), sea lion (MAstV-11), unclassified sea lion, mink (MAstV-21), and bat (MAstV-12) strains. A Himalayan marmot strain clusters with MAstV-6 strains (Figure 1a,b ). There appears to be a large diversity of MAstV strains not captured by the currently available sequences, highlighting the need for more detailed sampling and characterization of animal strains.

The isolation of astroviruses from avian species predates their isolation in humans, with disease in ducklings described in 1965, however the virus was not formally recognized as an astrovirus until 1984 [5, 84] . Avian astroviruses have been documented to cause infection in poultry leading to economic losses in farms and affecting food production worldwide [85] . Avian astroviruses have been associated with a spectrum of disease ranging from subclinical infection in seemingly healthy adult birds to heavy flock losses. Pleomorphic symptoms include enteritis in turkeys, chickens, and guineafowl, mild growth depression and nephritis in chickens, and hepatitis in ducklings [86] . Astrovirus infection has been implicated in pre-hatching mortality in ducklings and goslings [87] .

In addition to AAstV-1 comprised of TAstV-1, AAstV-2 comprised of ANV1 and ANV2, and AAstV-3 comprised of TAstV-2 and duck astrovirus 1 (DAstV-1), there are numerous yet-to-be classified viruses, including Turkey astrovirus 3 (TAstV-3), chicken astrovirus A (CAstV-A), chicken astrovirus B (CAstV-B) [88, 89] , GFAstV, and multiple viruses isolated from ducks including duck hepatitis virus 3 (DHV-3/DAstV-2) [88] , DHV-3/DAstV-2-like viruses, DAstV-CPH (DAstV-3) [90] , DAstV-4, DAstV-YP/DAstV-4-like, and diverse viruses isolated from wild birds [86] .

Avian astrovirus have been detected in outbreaks of enteric disease in turkey poults, and avian astrovirus were first reported as an agent of gastroenteritis and mortality in young turkeys in 1980, associated with a condition known as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) [91, 92] . Subsequently there have been sporadic reports of astrovirus outbreaks in turkeys, associated with enteritis and growth depression [93] . Based on serological and genetic analysis, two types of TAstV have been recognized (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2). TAstV-1 comprises the Avastrovirus 1 species and was first described in the U.K. [91] . TAstV-1 has limited detection in other avian species with sporadic detection in chicken and ducks and forms a discrete cluster in both the capsid and RdRp phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2a,b) . TAstV-2 was identified in 1996 [94] , and is likely to be classified within the species Avastrovirus 3 and is primarily associated with PEMS [95] . TAstV-2 is the predominant TAstV lineage, with a wider global circulation and greater genetic diversity compared to TAstV-1, reflected by the co-circulation of multiple sub-lineages (Figure 2a,b) . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene there appears to be limited interspecies transmission of TAstV-2-like viruses detected in chicken and duck (Figure 2b) . Astroviruses infecting guineafowl are closely related to TAstV-2 strains based on analysis of the RdRp region [96] , however the capsid region is distinct to TAstV-2 strains, forming a discrete cluster in a lineage of unassigned viruses suggesting they are closely related to CAstV-B strains (Figure 2a) . These GFAstVs were possibly derived from recombination and interspecies events followed by sustained transmission in the guineafowl population. This highlights the limitation of classifying viruses based on a single region of the genome.

Chicken astrovirus has been associated with runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in chickens characterized by poor weight gain, lower feed conversion, and mortality resulting in economic losses [97] , and ""white chicks"" disease associated with increased mortality of embryos and chicks, weakness, and white plumage [98] . Currently two serotypes of CAstV have been described [97] , and both serotypes form discrete clusters in the phylogenetic analysis of the capsid region within a lineage of unclassified viruses (likely to be classified within AAstV-1). The CAstV-A viruses form a smaller, discrete lineage, clustering closest to DAstV-2 strains (Figure 2a) . CAstV-B strains form a large lineage clustering closest to GFAstV strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the small region of the RdRp gene commonly sequenced, it does not allow CAstV-A and -B strains to form discrete clusters as seen in the capsid analysis, possibly reflecting multiple recombination events in CAstV strains (Figure 2b ). CAstV strains have limited detection in other avian species with sporadic detection in pigeon and duck (Figure 2a,b) .

Avian nephritis virus was identified in association with intestinal nephritis in chickens and growth retardation. The first serotype of ANV (ANV-1) was isolated from a healthy broiler chick in 1976 [99] and was initially regarded as a picornavirus, subsequently reclassified within the Astroviridae family in 2000 [100] . Based on capsid phylogenetic analysis, ANV-1 strains cluster within the AAstV-2 lineage forming a small, discrete, relatively conserved cluster (Figure 2a) . The second serotype (ANV-2) was later described from chicks with stunted growth [101] . Based on capsid phylogenetic analysis, ANV-2 strains cluster within the AAstV-2 lineage, forming a larger, more diverse sub-lineage compared to ANV-1. ANV-1 and ANV-2 viruses have also been sporadically detected in ducks and turkeys (Figure 2a) . A third serotype (ANV-3) detected in chickens and turkeys with RSS and locomotion impairment has been proposed based on sequencing of the ORF1a region, however complete genome sequences are unavailable for adequate comparisons to the recognized serotypes [102] . The virus designated pigeon ANV (P-ANV) was detected during an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in young pigeons in China [103] . P-ANV represents an interspecies transmission event from chickens to pigeon; based on phylogenetic analysis, P-ANV strains share a high degree of genetic similarity to ANV-2 strains and cluster closely with strains also circulating in China suggesting a localized transmission event, and these viruses should be considered as ANV-2 viruses and do not require a distinct designation (Figure 2a ) [104] . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the small region of the RdRp gene commonly sequenced, it does not allow ANV 1 and 2 strains to form discrete clusters as characterized in the capsid analysis (Figure 2b ). Whilst this may reflect common recombination events between ANV strains, the analysis of a small region does not adequately allow for distinct clustering.

Astrovirus infection in ducks has been associated with a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis, historically known as duck hepatitis virus type 2 (DHV-2), which was described in the U.K. and subsequently serotype DHV-3 was isolated in the USA [5, 84, 105, 106] . The 9th ICTV report classified DHV-2 and DHV-3 as DAstV-1 and DAstV-2, respectively [25] . DAstV-1 strains form a small, discrete cluster within the AAstV-3 lineage based on phylogenetic analysis of the capsid region, clustering closest to TAstV-2 strains (Figure 2a) . DAstV-2 viruses, currently unclassified, form a discrete, highly conserved cluster closest to CAstV-A strains (Figure 2a) . Based on phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp region, DAstV-1 is closely related to other unclassified duck strains whilst DAstV-2 strains are more closely related to TAstV-2 strains (Figure 2b ). Further unclassified serotypes have been described; DAstV-3-CPH, DAstV/C-NGB, and DAstV-4 [107] . Duck astrovirus DAstV-3/CPH has been suggested to transmit horizontally and vertically [108] and DAstV-3/CPH viruses have also been detected in goslings [107] . Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp region highlights the diversity of AAstV strains circulating in duck species (Figure 2b) . Strains endemic to ducks have limited detection in other avian species including geese (Figure 2a,b) .

Astroviruses have been detected in numerous wild aquatic species including teals, pintails, and shovelers (belonging to the order Anseriformes), sanderlings (order Charadriiformes), and herons and spoonbills (order Pelecaniformes) [86, 109] . Fewer land dwelling wild birds have been found to harbor avian astroviruses including doves and pigeons (order Colombiformes), European roller (order Coraciiformes), and black-naped monarch (order Passeriformes) [51, 104, 110, 111] . These viruses are highly divergent and largely unclassified, suggesting these viruses are endemic to the wild bird population (Figure 2a,b) . The migratory behavior of some of these species provides ideal conditions for virus dissemination and diversification as during migration there is a high degree of co-mingling and increased density of birds of different species that may originate from varied geographic regions [112] .

Phylogenies indicate that the genetic diversity of mamastroviruses has been shaped by extensive interspecies transmission events that have occurred in the past between wild and domestic species and humans. However, the inference of astrovirus interspecies transmission events is hampered due to (a) sequencing of only a small portion of the genome; (b) inadequate sampling; or (c) that the event occurred early during the divergence of astrovirus lineages. A few exceptions where host-jumps are apparent have been in livestock where a greater level of sampling has occurred. This includes hosts with a greater level of interaction (e.g., MAstV-13 in ovine and bovine) or host genetic similarly (e.g., MAstV-26 in wild boars and domestic pigs). With the exception of HAstV-4 strains associated with fatal meningoencephalitis, it is interesting to note that viruses from multiple species, all recognized to cause neurological symptoms, are closely related including human VA1/HMO-C viruses and mink and bovine viruses also associated with neurological symptoms, suggesting that these related viruses may have a distinct phenotype compared to other MAstV strains (Figure 1a,b) . Astrovirus strains identified from fecal samples of multiple non-human primate species from wild, captive, and peri-urban environments in Bangladesh and Cambodia reveal multiple interspecies transmission events, with viruses closely related to the VA/HMO lineage of human viruses, and non-human mammalian and avian astroviruses (Figure 1a,b) [28] .

Similarly, there appears to be evidence for a high degree of cross species transmission of avian astroviruses between farmed poultry species as described in the above sections. There also appears to be transmission between avian and mammalian species. The highly divergent strains isolated from European roller (Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 and Er/BMTK529/HUN/2011) exhibited low identity to avian and mammalian astroviruses, cluster within the MAstV lineage, and were likely derived from multiple recombination and interspecies transmission events [51] . The carnivorous diet of this avian species may have facilitated the interspecies transmission event between a rodent or small mammal species. This is the only report of a Mamastrovirus strain in an avian species; in contrast, there have been more reports of Avastrovirus strains detected in mammalian species which may reflect greater sampling density of the mammalian population. A highly divergent group of mink strains detected in China represent a novel clade of astroviruses that were distantly related to previously described mink astrovirus and were closely related to chicken and turkey astroviruses (Figure 2a,b) [113] .

These viruses are recombinant strains with the capsid region clustering with CAstV-B strains and the RdRp region clustering with human MAstV strains and CAstV strains (Figure 2a,b) . There have been two Avastrovirus strains detected in humans; a strain clustering close to ANV-1 strains detected in turkey and chicken was isolated from a child in The Gambia, and a strain clustering with ANV-2 strains detected in chicken was isolated from a child in Kenya [44] . Serological studies have been used to screen human sera from poultry workers for antibodies to TAstV-2, with up to 26% of participants positive with the highest detection in abattoir workers and turkey growers [114] , suggesting avian strains may be readily transmitted to humans under prolonged close contact.

The important role that ecotones play in astrovirus cross-species transmission has been proposed [112] . Ecotones are ecological transition areas such as small and medium sized farms which rear multiple species. The co-rearing of poultry such as domestic ducks, chickens, turkey, and guineafowl can facilitate transmission between these species but also transmission to wild birds [112] . Farms and abattoirs have also been recognized as environments facilitating transmission between livestock species and to farm and abattoir workers [114] . Many other species have contact with livestock in a farming environment; in addition to wild species, companion animals such as cats and dogs and other peri-domestic animals have contact with livestock and their biological waste providing substantial opportunities for cross-species transmission. Astroviruses also persist in bodies of water making the aquatic environment ideal for the transmission of viruses infecting avian species, aquatic mammalian species, and possible transmission between terrestrial and aquatic species. Untreated or inadequately treated sewage and waste water from domestic and farmed areas can reach fresh and marine bodies of water transmitting human and animal viruses. Astroviruses have been detected in the environment and the durability of the virus in this environment may greatly contribute to cross-species transmission within and between terrestrial and aquatic species, generating significant diversity [115] .

In addition to interspecies transmission which generates significant diversity in astrovirus species, both intra-species and inter-species recombination can rapidly generate novel, divergent viruses. Full-and partial-genome sequence analysis has identified multiple strains that have undergone recombination events, which are predominately located within the ORF1b/ORF2 junction region of the genome, which is a region with an RNA secondary structure predicted to contain a stable hairpin structure [21, 34, [116] [117] [118] [119] . A virus with a recombination event within the ORF1a region has been identified [119] . Some recombinants appear to be highly stable and show widespread detection [21] , whilst others are detected sporadically as single strains. Numerous human recombinant strains have been reported between HAstV strains, including strains with HAstV-1 (ORF1b) and HAstV-4 (ORF2) parental viruses, HAstV-1 (ORF1b) and HAstV-3 (ORF2) parental viruses, HAstV-3 (ORF1b) and HAstV-2 (ORF2), and VA2 (ORF1b) and MLB1 (ORF2) parental viruses [116, [119] [120] [121] .

Divergent species often represent recombination events between strains of different species. In 2010, the study conducted by Rivera et al. suggested the possibility of a recombination event between human and California sea lion astrovirus strains [26] . A recombinant strain derived from porcine astrovirus and human HAstV-3 strains was reported from piglets and children from various regions of Colombia [62] . ANV strains that appear to be derived from recombination events between ANV-1 (ORF1b) and ANV-2 (ORF2) have been described in the USA [85] .

The increased sampling density of numerous host species combined with the more prevalent use of NGS technologies and viral metagenomic studies will increase the detection of novel strains, further driving the need for a unified, complex, and encompassing classification system. The previously common practice of sequencing a relatively conserved RdRp amplicon of 300-400 bp renders many sequences available in GenBank of little use in detailed phylogenetic analysis, as does the frequent missing metadata regarding species of isolation, country, and date of collection. Sequencing small regions is not adequate to determine if a virus strain is a novel, divergent strain or a recombinant virus. Recommendations should be made to encourage full genome sequencing where possible and the deposition of associated host and demographic information. Although analysis of amino acid sequences of the capsid region is required for classification, it leads to confusion regarding appropriate phylogenetic analysis, with highly inconsistent publication of nucleotide and amino acid trees further complicating attempts to clarify diversity and classification. The topologies of amino acid trees differ to those of nucleotide trees, particularly for the analysis of MAstV, and whilst amino acid trees are required for classification, nucleotide trees may be more appropriate for describing within species diversity (Figures S1 and S2) . Incorporating a standardized nomenclature to aid in classification has proven invaluable in the classification of numerous viruses, including rotavirus and influenza [122] . Adopting a nomenclature that records the appropriate metadata associated with sample collection including host, location, date of collection, and determined species and serotype as proposed by Martella and colleagues would vastly improve the usability of strains for more complex analyses [38] .

Despite a substantial increase in our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses, far less is known about the diversity, evolution and origin of RNA viruses across the diverse phylogenetic range of viruses, and particularly in healthy animals that are often only rarely utilized for virological sampling. Fortunately, recent advances in virus discovery using metagenomic approaches are beginning to reveal a multitude of RNA viruses in vertebrates other than birds and mammals. In particular, fish harbor a remarkable array of RNA viruses, including the relatives of important pathogens. In addition, despite frequent cross-species transmission, the RNA viruses in vertebrates generally follow the evolutionary history of their hosts, which began in the oceans and then moved to terrestrial habitats over timescales covering hundreds of millions of years.

RNA viruses are responsible for a wide range of human diseases, from the relatively mild respiratory infections associated with some rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, to life threatening hemorrhagic fevers. The association between viruses and disease dates to the beginning of virology at the junction of the 19th and 20th centuries, when the first viruses were identified in plants and animals suffering from overt diseases (tobacco mosaic virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus, respectively). As mammals and birds often experience relatively similar infectious disease to humans, and live in close proximity to us, they are commonly thought to be the natural reservoir hosts of the RNA viruses that subsequently emerge and cause diseases in humans through a process of cross-species transmission [1, 2] . Consequently, considerable effort has been directed towards investigating the diversity, evolution and origins of RNA viruses associated with mammalian and bird hosts. To date, a multitude of related RNA viruses have been identified from mammalian and bird hosts, including those that have emerged or reemerged in humans or domestic animals. Important examples include coronaviruses in bats [3 ] , hantaviruses in rodents and shrews [4] , and influenza A viruses in birds and a variety of mammals [5] . Although these results are of importance, mammals and birds represent only a small proportion (less than 25%) of total number of vertebrates, and little is known about the natural viromes of the vast number of vertebrate species. Indeed, recent metagenomic studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] suggest that our understanding of the true biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses is limited, fragmentary and biased.

Viruses likely infect all cellular organisms, and are ubiquitous in all natural environments, such that they can be considered the most abundant source of nucleic on earth [12] . Compared with birds and mammals, 'lower' vertebrates, which we define here as all vertebrates other than birds and mammals (i.e. amphibians, reptiles and various groups of fish, and jawless vertebrates), exhibit a far greater biological diversity with approximately 33 000 documented species. In particular, fish exhibit a remarkable diversity and abundance in both fresh water and marine environments, and account for approximately 50% of total described number of vertebrate species. It is therefore possible, if not likely, that fish also harbor an enormous diversity of as yet uncharacterized RNA viruses. Indeed, those fish viruses described to date have largely been sampled from animals experiencing overt disease and that the potential to cause huge losses in aquaculture [13] [14] [15] . In addition, despite an enormous increase in the number of invertebrate RNA viruses described in recent years [16 ,17 ] , we still know little about the evolutionary links between RNA viruses carried by invertebrates and vertebrates, again reflecting a lack of the sampling of the key taxa.

Within individual virus families or genera, those RNA viruses associated with vertebrates tend to form monophyletic groups and are often distantly related to those sampled from invertebrates [16 ,17 ] . This suggests that there are likely major evolutionary gaps between invertebrate and vertebrate RNA viruses, although whether this will withstand more intensive sampling is unknown. Additionally, the time scale of evolutionary history of RNA viruses remains unclear, with very different inferences estimated using a suite of different methods. Molecular clock-based analyses of individual viruses have often suggested very recent origins, even for wellknown etiologic agents with a documented historical record, such as rabies virus, which may be only a few thousand years old [9, 18] . By contrast, far old evolutionary histories, on the scales of millions of years, have been revealed at the level of virus families, either by using endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that are integrated into host genomes to calibrate molecular clocks [19] , or through patterns of host-virus association inferred through phylogenetic trees (see below). Although we know a great deal more about the diversity and evolution of RNA viruses than we did before the start of this millennium, it is also apparent that we are only just starting to scratch the surface of their true biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses.

Fortunately, a remarkable number and diversity of RNA viruses have recently been discovered in lower vertebrates through meta-transcriptomic approaches [20 ] . Indeed, all types of virus family identified in mammals have now been found in lower vertebrates ( Figure 1 ). In particular, an amazing diversity of RNA viruses (>17 families) has now been documented in fish, including viruses that are related to those that cause severe human disease today. This strongly suggests that these families of RNA viruses have an evolutionary history that may stretch back to the entire history of the vertebrates. In what follows we briefly review some of the key advances in our understanding of the diversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses, and discuss some of the challenges for the future.

Due to intense interest in the ongoing occurrence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (including avian influenza, SARS, and Ebola disease) in recent decades, the number of known RNA viruses from mammals and birds has increased rapidly [21,22 ,23,24,25 ] . However, the situation is very different in the case of lower vertebrates. Prior to 2000, very few of RNA viruses had been identified from amphibians, reptiles, and fish, and these are always associated with overt disease that could result in huge economic losses [15, 26, 27] . However, following the extensive use of PCR and the Sanger sequencing methods for virus identification over the past decade, the number of RNA viruses sampled from lower vertebrates has steadily increased [28] , with notable examples being arenavirus and paramyxoviruses in reptiles [29] , and novirhabdoviruses and other RNA viruses from fish [30] , although these numbers were still very limited compared to the viruses described in birds and mammals. Also of importance was that the viruses sampled from lower vertebrates are usually divergent from those in birds and mammals, such as arenavirus and coronavirus [24, 31] , in turn suggesting that there is a huge diversity of unsampled viruses that occupy the 'long branches' separating these taxa.

The most dramatic increase in the biodiversity of RNA viruses from lower vertebrates has been achieved by using a bulk RNA-sequencing approach known as meta-transcriptomics [20 ] . For example, this approach has led to the discovery of more than 200 novel viruses in 186 species of vertebrates sampled from both terrestrial and aquatic environments in China [20 ] . These vertebrates represent the phylogenetic diversity in vertebrates that had not been screened previously, including lancelets (Leptocardii), jawless fish (Agnatha), cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), lobefinned fish (Sarcopterygii), amphibians (Amphibia), and reptiles (Reptilia). Of these newly discovered viruses, the majority (196 viruses) are vertebrate-specific that are thought only to infect vertebrate hosts, with the remaining 18 viruses thought to represent can be thought of as 'vector-borne' viruses that are able to infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Strikingly, these viruses cover virtually all known types of viruses previously identified in avian and mammalian hosts. Additionally, some of the newly discovered viruses (such as vertebrate associated astro-like viruses) may represent new vertebrate-associated virus families [20 ] , implying that far greater numbers and diversity of RNA viruses are present in lower vertebrates than previously realized and identified to date.

Similarly, fish also contain viruses that are relatively closely related to known human pathogens. For example, Lassa hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, are well known due to the extensive damage they cause in human patients and represent a major threat to public health. Importantly, in all these cases, those viruses identified in ray-finned fish were the most closely related to those of the Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, and Hantaviridae, showing that these previously mammal-dominated and disease-causing viruses have relatives in aquatic vertebrates [20 ] . Additionally, influenza-like viruses were also discovered from jawless fish, ray-finned fish, and amphibians, with those from ray-finned fish currently the closest known relative to human influenza B virus. Remarkably, although they were sampled in lower vertebrates, and hence likely separated from mammals hundreds of millions of years ago, these viruses exhibited similar tissue tropisms as their mammalian counterparts, again arguing for the antiquity of these vertebrate-specific viruses in nature.

In sum, all these data imply that the viruses that infect us today have once infected vertebrates that ultimately occupied aquatic environments (Figure 2) , although it is possible that some even extend back to the origin of animals that may have occupied terrestrial habitats.

Although RNA viruses have universally small genomes, recent data suggests that they experience as complex processes of genome evolution as those large DNA viruses and utilize a wide range of replication-expression strategies [32 ] . Recent meta-genomic studies reveal that invertebrates appear to be a particularly rich source of genomic diversity for RNA viruses [17 ,33 ] . Indeed, the genomes of invertebrate RNA viruses are more complex in both size and structure than those of related viruses from vertebrates [32 ] . For example, the genome of Chuviruses, which likely represent at least a new family, are more diverse and have more intricate structures -including mixtures of segmented, unsegmented, and even circular genomes -than all other virus families [16 ] . Although the newly discovered RNA viruses from lower vertebrates have relatively simple genomes in both size and structure than those sampled from invertebrates [20 ,33 ] , their genomes still show greater variation in architectures than their counterparts in mammalian and avian hosts. These include variations in genome length, organization of open reading frames, changes in the order and number of glycoproteins, and even number of segments. For example, two arenaviruses, which were discovered from marine fish, have three RNA segments instead of two seen in mammalian or reptile hosts [20 ] . Interestingly, arenaviruses with three RNA segments have also been found in arthropods [17 ] , all known arenaviruses form a monophyletic cluster within the order Bunyavirales in trees of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [16 ] . Additional studies are needed to reveal the true history of evolutionary events: that is, whether there has been a decrease in segment number (but not gene content) from three to two in the arenaviruses, or an increase in segment numbers from two to three in the arenavirus-bunyavirus group.

Each cellular organism likely possesses multiple DNA and RNA viruses. Indeed, an increasing number of studies have shown that RNA viruses can have a broad spectrum of hosts [21,22 ,23,24,25 ] . In particular, recent metagenomic studies have shown that the host spectrum of invertebrate RNA viruses is remarkably broad, including different phyla and sometimes different kingdoms [16 ,17 ] . However, due to major sampling biases, the hosts of vertebrate RNA viruses are mainly dominated by 12 Viral evolution mammals, and to a lesser extent birds [32 ] . Therefore, our understanding of the host spectrum and virus-host association of vertebrate RNA viruses is clearly far from complete. Fortunately, the discovery of diverse viruses from a diverse range of lower vertebrates is helping to fills these gaps, revealing that the host spectrum of vertebrate RNA viruses is broad [20 ] , although still markedly narrower than that seen in invertebrates [16 ,17 ] . The difference between invertebrates and vertebrates most likely reflects differences in species numbers, population size, abundance, and the evolution of adaptive immunity in the latter.

That RNA viruses may co-diverge with their mammalian hosts has been known for several decades, and is well documented in some groups such as the hantaviruses (Figure 3 ) [34] . Even in the case of invertebrate RNA viruses, viruses tend to form separate phylogenetic groups loosely based on the evolutionary relationships of their host taxa [16 ,17 ] , reflecting the long-term co-divergence between viruses and their invertebrate hosts (although with relatively frequent host-jumping; see below). With the exception of some interesting cases such as influenza virus and rotaviruses, the same general pattern also seems to be true of those RNA viruses newly described in lower vertebrates, in which there is a general clustering of related viruses from related hosts [20 ] . In particular, it is striking that the RNA viruses sampled from fish tend to fall basal to those sampled from amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, reflecting their divergent phylogenetic position within vertebrates (Figure 1) . Hence, at the broad-scale, the phylogeny of vertebrate RNA viruses overall mirrors that of their vertebrate hosts, with a transition from ocean to land (Figure 2 ). This overall co-phylogenetic match between RNA viruses and their vertebrate hosts strongly suggests that the viruses that still infect us today are ancient and have evolutionary histories that date back to first vertebrates, and even perhaps the first animals.

However, despite the overall co-divergence between RNA viruses and their vertebrate hosts, it is also clear that host-switching events have frequently occurred during evolutionary history. Previous studies have revealed the important role of the cross-species transmission in the evolution and the emergence of RNA viruses in humans [4, 35] . As in the case of many RNA viruses from birds and mammals (e.g. influenza virus [35] and hantavirus [36] ), host-switching events are also commonplace among lower vertebrates [20 ] . For example, that an influenza virus from a fish is the closest known relative of mammalian influenza B virus, clearly conflicts with the host phylogeny. Similar host-switching events also observed for the viruses sampled from lungfish (in the Picornaviridae, hepacivirus and aquareovirus) that exhibited a closer evolutionary relationship with those from ray-finned fish rather than those from tetrapods to which they are more closely related. In addition, as in the case of mammalian Coordination of phytovirus long-distance movement Zhang et al. 13 viruses such as Seoul (hanta) virus in rats and SARSrelated virus in bats [37, 38] , single viruses are occasionally associated with multiple host species or even multiple host orders. Indeed, across the phylogenies as a whole it is possible that host-switching has been more common during the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses than co-divergence, particularly among hosts that share similar environments [20 ,36,38] . Together, these results suggest that virus evolution is a complex interaction between virus-host co-divergence over many millions of years and frequent cross-species transmission, with the evolutionary history of many virus groups reflecting an interweaving of both processes [39 ] .

Despite an increasingly large scale of meta-transcriptomic surveys of invertebrates globally, some vertebrate RNA viruses (e.g. arenaviruses, filoviruses, hantaviruses, and paramyxoviruses) have not yet been identified in invertebrates, implying that they only originated in the latter (or that the wrong invertebrates have thus far been sampled). Similarly, although the phylum Echinodermata and the subphylum Tunicata of Chordata are more closely related to vertebrates than invertebrates, it is notable that the viruses identified in these animals were closely related to those associated with invertebrates, suggesting that there is a major phylogenetic 'break' in virus biodiversity following their divergence from the vertebrate lineage [16 ] . The reasons for these disjunct patterns of virus distributions across phylogenies are currently unclear.

The antiquity of vertebrate RNA viruses is also apparent from some molecular clock based dating schemes, particularly using endogenous virus elements (EVEs). Comparisons of exogenous viruses and their endogenous relatives have shown that the Filoviridae and Bornaviridae emerged at least 30 million years (Myr) ago and 50 Myr ago, respectively, again indicative of an ancient evolutionary history [40, 41] . Remarkably, however, the discovery of the divergent filoviruses and bornavivirus from rayfinned fish indicates that both viruses have great ancient evolutionary histories that greatly extend beyond the calibration dates achieved with endogenous viruses.

Our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses has expanded dramatically since the millennium, and especially so following the metagenomic evolution of recent years. It is now clear that the virosphere is far larger and complex than previously envisioned, and that we have only sampled a tiny fraction of this remarkable biodiversity [32 ] . Although the most studied group, it is also the case that we have only sampled a small subset of total described vertebrate species, particularly for screening viruses using unbiased meta-transcriptomic approaches. It is also likely that lower vertebrates, and other animals, harbor RNA viruses are so divergent from known viruses that they cannot be detected using available Blast-based approaches [32 ] , so that our sampling is necessarily biased toward 'detectable' viruses. It is therefore clear that more expensive and better sampling worldwide, especially in uncommon vertebrate species, and more powerful approaches for virus characterization are needed to help us to find these divergent viruses, such as led to the discovery of the chuviruses and the jingmenviruses [16 ,42] , which will in turn help fill the evolutionary gaps of RNA viruses.

Although we know that vertebrate RNA viruses have an ancient evolutionary history, it is difficult at present to paint a clear picture about their origin and evolution, including their evolutionary relationship with invertebrate viruses which is likely to be complex, particularly as our sampling of basal vertebrates remains poor. That some RNA viruses seemingly only infect vertebrates suggest that they are 'vertebrate-specific' viruses, while another 'vector-borne' class are able to simultaneously infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. However, it is important to note that for well known vector-borne viruses (such as dengue and Zika viruses), their true natural hosts are likely to be arthropods, and that they secondarily evolved to infect vertebrates. Indeed, it is striking that some of vertebrate viruses, including recently discovered viruses from lower vertebrates, fall to the basal of the classic vector-borne viruses [20 ] . Overall, the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses seems to reflect a complex interplay between long-term virus-host co-divergence and frequent hostswitching. Greater taxonomic sampling is clearly the goal for the future, and the discovery of viruses that fill the gaps between vertebrate and invertebrate viruses will clearly be important in helping to resolve virus origins.

Although only a miniscule proportion of RNA viruses have been known to cause diseases in humans, some of uncharacterized viruses will surely be able to cross interspecies genetic barrier and emerge in humans. Identifying this subset will be difficult, particularly as the mechanisms that enhance or prevent the successful crossspecies transmission of viruses remain unclear. Although we now know that the evolutionary history of vertebrate RNA viruses is characterized by frequent cross-species transmission on the background of co-divergence, it is not clear whether RNA viruses with a history of cross-species transmission and multiple hosts emerge more frequently in humans compared to those with specific virus-host association [32 ,36] , or whether emergence is strongly dependent on local epidemiological and ecological features with less impact of virus phylogenetic history. In addition, far less is known about the interaction between viruses each other, viruses and other micro-organisms, and their hosts, especially how these interactions act to prevent or enhance diseases in humans even though this is likely to be central to understanding disease emergence [43] . Finally, although of fundamental scientific importance, we contend that rather than simply surveying biodiversity and classifying new viruses, the goal for the future of metagenomic studies should be to perform research focused on reveal the fundamental patterns and processes of virus evolution [20 ] , which will be greatly enhanced by a better understanding of the virus.

Evolution and Genetic Diversity of Porcine Circovirus 3 in China,"The identification of a new circovirus (Porcine Circovirus 3, PCV3) has raised concern because its impact on swine health is not fully known. In Fujian Province in eastern China, even its circulating status and genetic characteristics are unclear. Here, we tested 127 tissue samples from swine from Fujian Province that presented respiratory symptoms. All of the PCV3 positive samples were negative for many other pathogens involved in respiratory diseases like PCV2, PRRSV, and CSFV, suggesting that PCV3 is potentially pathogenic. From phylogenetic analysis, PCV3 strains are divided into two main clades and five sub-clades; PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. Our identified strains belong to genotypes PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, and PCV3b-2, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity of PCV3 in Fujian province until 2019. Interestingly, we found the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of PCV3 was dated to the 1950s, and PCV3 has a similar evolutionary rate as PCV2 (the main epidemic genotypes PCV2b and PCV2d). In addition, positive selection sites N56D/S and S77T/N on the capsid gene are located on the PCV3 antigen epitope, indicating that PCV3 is gradually adaptive in swine. In summary, our results provide important insights into the epidemiology of PCV3.","The Circovirus genus claimed veterinarians' attention shortly after its discovery, most members infect avian species but swine also serve as natural hosts [1, 2] . PCV1 and PCV2 are infectious agents in swine [3] ; PCV1 was first detected as a contaminant of PK-15 cell cultures and has not been associated with clinical disease, PCV2 is a ubiquitous, economically important pathogen to the swine industry [4] . PCV2 infection leads to a diverse range of clinical diseases collectively termed PCV2-associated disease (PCVAD), which includes post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), interstitial pneumonia, enteric disease, and reproductive failure [5] . Porcine Circovirus 3 (PCV3) is the third member of the Circovirus genus to infect swine [6] , it has a circular ssDNA genome of approximatively 2000 bases containing three identified ORFs [6] , although only ORF1 and ORF2 have been characterized. ORF1, located on the positive strand, apparently codes for a single replication-associated protein (Rep) of 296-297 aa [6] . ORF2 is on the negative strand and encodes the capsid protein (Cap). Despite the common genomic organization, PCV3 is distantly related to other known circoviruses, although a relatively close relationship with bat circoviruses has been suggested based on phylogenetic analysis [7] . There is also some unresolved opinion on the genotyping of PCV3. For example, Li et al. divide PCV3 into 3a and 3b, while Ouyang et al. suggest that PCV3 can be divided into PCV3a, 3b and 3c [7, 8] .

PCV3 was first identified in the USA in 2015; from tissues of animals presenting porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PNDS) and reproductive disorders, but that had tested negative for PCV2; a metagenomics approach revealed an uncharacterized virus [6] . PCV3 has since been identified in Asia [9] [10] [11] , South America, and Europe [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] in swine with various clinical syndromes [6] . Its comparable prevalence in healthy swine [17] and wild boar [18, 19] however, raises questions about its role in swine pathogenesis.

In China, the presence of PCV3 has been confirmed in more than 24 provinces and regions, but its prevalence on swine farms (especially in asymptomatic herds) is not well established and specific genetic information is lacking, particularly in eastern China. The aim of this study was to determine the infection status and genetic characteristics of PCV3 in swine presenting respiratory symptoms on farms in Fujian province, eastern China. In addition, we aimed to elucidate the evolution and genetic diversity of PCV3 at the national scale.

One hundred and twenty-seven lung samples were collected from one hundred and twenty-seven swine on fifty-five farms in Fujian province, China. Samples were homogenated then subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 • C, after which supernatants were collected for DNA extraction. Viral DNA was extracted using the Virus Genomics DNA Isolation Kit (Tianlong Biotech, Suzhou, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR with pair specific primers (Table 1) was used for detecting PCV3, PCV2, CSFV, and PRRSV [20, 21] . PCR conditions were as follows: for each sample 12.5 µL of 2× Taq Master mix (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China), 9.5 µL of double distilled water (ddH2O), 1 µL of template DNA, 0.4 nmol/L forward and 0.4 nmol/L reverse primer were combined. Thermocycler conditions were 95 • C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 • C for 30 s, annealing at 59 • C for 30 s, and extension at 72 • C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 • C for 10 min. Samples were held at 4 • C until further use. Complete genomes were amplified using the Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China) with the same amplification conditions, subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, then sent to Tsingke (Nanjing, China) for sequencing. Sequences were assembled using the BioEdit software [22] . Table 1 . Primers used in this study.

Amplicon Length (bp) 

Three hundred and six complete PCV3 genomes, collected between 1996 and 2019 from different countries, were downloaded from GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). All sequences were separated by Rep and Cap according coding region, then the coding area was spliced together (Supplementary Table S1 ). MUSCLE [23] was used to align sequences, and manual adjustments were made to the alignment using MEGA7.0 [24] . After poor quality sequences were removed, 272 reference sequences remained. The best fit nucleotide substitution model was selected using ModelFind in IQ-tree [25] . The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed using RAxML (version 2.8.10) [26] . For nucleotide substitution, we used the General Time Reversible parameter plus the GAMMA distribution model (GTR + G) pre-estimated, with 1000 bootstrap replicates. To estimate the time elapsed since the most recent common ancestor and the rate of PCV3 evolution, we constructed a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, using BEAST (v1.8.4) [27] and the Cap protein sequences. The substitution model was set to GTR + G with a relaxed molecular clock (lognormal), and the tree prior was coalescent (Bayesian skyline) according to model comparison built in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The total chain length was 1 × 10 8 , with sampling every 10,000 steps. Two independent runs were performed and then combined using LogCombiner. The final MCC tree was annotated using TreeAnnotator and visualized using Figtree.

The ML tree based on full-length sequences (spliced ORF1 and ORF2 coding region) was uploaded to DataMonkey (www.datamonkey.org) to estimate branching and sites under selection. Selected sites were identified using four algorithms: single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), mixed effects model of evolution (MEME), fixed effects likelihood (FEL), and fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR). Positively selected branches were identified using the adaptive branch-site REL test for episodic diversification (aBSREL) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . A site was considered to be under positive selection only if it satisfied at least two algorithms (p < 0.1 in SLAC, p < 0.05 in FEL and MEME, p > 0.9 in FUBAR). Cap sequences from strains PCV3a and PCV3b were used to predict protein structures in I-TASSER (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [33] . Structures were visualized using PyMoL. Table S2 ). It should be noted that these seven samples were negative for PCV2, CSFV and PRRSV. All the PCV3 genomes we sequenced here were 2000 bp. Sequencing analysis of the full-length genomes, and Rep and Cap genes revealed maximum nucleotide sequence similarities amongst each other of 98.85-99.80%, 99.00-100% and 98.60-99.80% respectively, and to reference strains from GenBank of 91.24-99.90%, 98.2-100% and 96.7-100% respectively. Maximum amino acid sequence similarities for Rep and Cap were 99.3-100% and 98.1-100% within the strains, and compared to reference strains were 97.2-100% and 96.7-100% (Table 2) 

After removal of poor-quality data from an initial set of 306 PCV3 sequences obtained from GenBank, 272 reference sequences from the 14 countries remained (Figure 1 ). We used these, along with PCV3 sequences generated in our study, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Based on the ML tree ( Figure 2 ), PCV3 can be classified into two main clades, PCV3a and PCV3b. At a higher level of resolution, PCV3a can be divided into PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3a-3, while PCV3b is comprised of PCV3b-1 and PCV3b-2. Globally, PCV3a strains outnumber PCV3b strains. Similarly, of the sequences from the PCV3 strains we isolated, five of seven were classified as PCV3a and two as PCV3b. From the tree, we found that the strains we isolated in Fujian were PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3 and PCV3b-2. In addition, these strains were close to the strains found in Jilin, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces. The tMRCA was estimated to be 1954.25 with 95% highest probability density (HPD) between 1940.70 and 1984.90, while the evolutionary rate was estimated to be 2.41 × 10 −4 with 95% HPD between 1.53 × 10 −4 and 3.40 × 10 −4 ( Figure 3A ). 

After removal of poor-quality data from an initial set of 306 PCV3 sequences obtained from GenBank, 272 reference sequences from the 14 countries remained (Figure 1 ). We used these, along with PCV3 sequences generated in our study, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Based on the ML tree (Figure 2 ), PCV3 can be classified into two main clades, PCV3a and PCV3b. At a higher level of resolution, PCV3a can be divided into PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3a-3, while PCV3b is comprised of PCV3b-1 and PCV3b-2. Globally, PCV3a strains outnumber PCV3b strains. Similarly, of the sequences from the PCV3 strains we isolated, five of seven were classified as PCV3a and two as PCV3b. From the tree, we found that the strains we isolated in Fujian were PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3 and PCV3b-2. In addition, these strains were close to the strains found in Jilin, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces. The tMRCA was estimated to be 1954.25 with 95% highest probability density (HPD) between 1940.70 and 1984.90, while the evolutionary rate was estimated to be 2.41 × 10 −4 with 95% HPD between 1.53 × 10 −4 and 3.40 × 10 −4 ( Figure 3A ).

The scaled effective population size (Neτ) for PCV3 was also estimated. Figure 3B shows that the population size increased from 1985 to 2012, then stabilized until 2016. From 2016 to 2019, the population size declined slightly but was still at a high level (about 5 × 10 2 ). 

Selective pressure analysis demonstrated a clear dominance of sites under negative pressure both in the Rep and Cap proteins [34] . We detected four positively selected amino acid sites, one at residue 122 in the Rep protein, and three at residues 24, 56, and 77 in Cap (Table 3) . Residues 122 in Rep and 24 in Cap were detected by all methods (SLAC, FEL, FUBAR and MEME). In contrast, residues 56 and 77 were detected only by FEL and FUBAR. However, there was no positively selected branch in the PCV3 ML tree. Interestingly, several positively selected sites were associated with functional activities. Cap residues 24, 56, and 77 were in the epitope region and were classified as positively selected sites by Li et al. and Sun et al. [7, 9] (Figure 4 ). Residue 122 in Rep was also described as positively selected by Li et al. The scaled effective population size (Neτ) for PCV3 was also estimated. Figure 3B shows that the population size increased from 1985 to 2012, then stabilized until 2016. From 2016 to 2019, the population size declined slightly but was still at a high level (about 5 × 10 2 ).

The identification of PCV3, a new porcine circovirus resembling the significantly pathogenic PCV2, has raised a great interest in its evolution and epidemiology. In China, the number of emerging swine viruses has increased in the last years [7, 35] raising two pressing questions. i) Are swine novel hosts to these viruses? ii) What is the epidemic character of PCV3 in China? Although PCV3 strains from most parts of China have been well studied, there is no systematic analysis of the prevalence and evolutionary characteristics of strains in eastern China, especially in Fujian Province. Fujian is a large aquaculture province with a subtropical monsoon climate that provides favorable conditions for the prevalence and evolution of disease.

Although some evidence supports an association between PCV3 infection and clinical disease [6] , contradictory reports have been published [36] , and more extensive studies are needed. Fu et al., 2018 found that in southern China 22.3% of samples were co-infected with PCV2. Ku et al., 2017 found that 45.4% of PCV3 positive samples were also positive for PCV2, while Zhang et al., 2018 found coinfection of PCV2 and PCV3 in 6.8% of the 265 clinical samples screened in that study. In a survey of samples from Shandong province we found 59.4% were infected with PCV3 alone and 39.3% were co-infected with PCV2 [37] . In this study, we found that all the samples from swine with respiratory symptoms were positive for PCV3 only. Although there are some people think PCV3 is suspicious of the pathogenicity of the herd [38] , research on PCV3 pathogenicity should be further studied. Additionally, there are differing views of the phylogenetic analysis of PCV3; we found that PCV3 can be divided into two clades: PCV3a, PCV3b, and five sub-clades PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. This agrees with the report by Li et al. [7] , but not fully with Ouyang et al., who are using ORF2 gene for analysis [8] . PCV3a is the most wide spread genotype in Fujian province 

The identification of PCV3, a new porcine circovirus resembling the significantly pathogenic PCV2, has raised a great interest in its evolution and epidemiology.

This agrees with the report by Li et al. [7] , but not fully with Ouyang et al., who are using ORF2 gene for analysis [8] . PCV3a is the most wide spread genotype in Fujian province consisting of PCV3a-1, PC3a-2 and PCV3a-3. Meanwhile, PCV3b-2but not PCV3b-1 was also found in Fujian province. Thus, in Fujian province, PCV3 has a high genetic diversity, in addition, the tMRCA of PCV3 is estimated later than in Saraiva et al. [39] . From previous important studies [7] , it is known that an alanine at amino acid number 24 distinguishes PCV3a from PCV3b, which has a valine at that site. In our study the strain PCV3-CN-FJ27-2018 had a valine at position 24 but it belongs to the PCV3a group. This prompts us to propose that PCV3 subtypes might recombine with each other during infections, similar to PCV2. After MCMC analysis we found that the evolutionary rate of PCV3 exceeds that of canine parvovirus or porcine pseudorabies virus but is similar to PCV2b and PCV2d [40, 41] , this result is similar to that reported by Li et al. [7] . However, based on more reference sequences than used in the studies of Li et al., the tMRCA of PCV3 is earlier than reported in those studies. The estimated Neτ value of PCV3 is greater than that of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We expect scaled effective population size Neτ to follow I/2β, where β is the equilibrium rate of transmission and I is the equilibrium number of infections. Although the duration of infection time of PCV3 in swine is unknown, given the large population size, its true value should also be similar to or greater than the estimated value.

Additionally, we found some amino acids on the antigen epitope that have been subject to positive selection during evolution. Similar to previous reports, amino acid 24 and 77 were found to be subjected to positive selection [7, 8] , however, amino acid 56 was first found in the Cap protein. Our results indicate the action of the host immune response in shaping PCV3 evolution. Swine with respiratory symptoms were positive only for PCV3, which may indicate that PCV3 has gradually adapted to swine and even become pathogenic to swine.

Although the number of sequences in PCV3 is increasing, we found that the analysis results are very similar to those reported previously after removal of poor quality sequences [7] . Pcv3 is still one of the DNA viruses with the highest evolutionary rate. In addition, it is of great concern that the inaccuracy of early samples' epidemiological results may be caused by many laboratory pollutions. This situation will greatly misleading the evolution rate analysis of certain viruses, especially for new emerging viruses, so the evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 deserve further study. Our study has increased the information on the genetics and molecular characteristics of PCV3. These results will contribute to the evaluation of the relevance of PCV3 to the swine industry, and to the planning of effective control strategies in China.

Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations?,"It is a commonly held view that genetically homogenous host populations are more vulnerable to infection than genetically diverse populations. The underlying idea, known as the 'monoculture effect,' is well documented in agricultural studies. Low genetic diversity in the wild can result from bottlenecks (that is, founder effects), biparental inbreeding or self-fertilization, any of which might increase the risk of epidemics. Host genetic diversity could buffer populations against epidemics in nature, but it is not clear how much diversity is required to prevent disease spread. Recent theoretical and empirical studies, particularly in Daphnia populations, have helped to establish that genetic diversity can reduce parasite transmission. Here, we review the present theoretical work and empirical evidence, and we suggest a new focus on finding 'diversity thresholds.'","It seems to be conventional wisdom that genetically homogeneous populations suffer from more severe pathogen outbreaks than diverse populations (Elton, 1958; Sherman et al., 1988; Schmid-Hempel, 1998; Altizer et al., 2003) . Infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts (Anderson and May, 1986) , and upon encountering resistant hosts, parasites would likely die, fail to successfully reproduce (Anderson and May, 1986) , or otherwise be removed from the population (Keesing et al., 2006) . As such, the risk of infection, especially by virulent pathogens, may select for outcrossing over uniparental forms reproduction, such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis King et al., 2009; Morran et al., 2011) , resulting in an overall increase in genetic diversity (King et al., 2011) . There may not seem to be an escape from disease, but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infection.

The empirical link between disease spread and genetic diversity has its origin in agricultural research. Agricultural fields represent environments in which plants are selected for high yield, and may therefore exhibit less genetic polymorphism than those in the wild. It is well known that disease epidemics have devastated agricultural monocultures (for example, rice blast, Zhu et al., 2000) , and that monocultures are typically more susceptible to outbreaks than diverse mixtures of crops (Mundt, 2002) . This association between low diversity and high disease incidence is called the 'monoculture effect' (for example, Elton, 1958; Leonard, 1969; Garrett and Mundt, 1999; Zhu et al., 2000; Pilet et al., 2006) . Here, we examine how genetic diversity affects the spread of disease in natural populations. We also consider the theoretical basis for the monoculture effect in host populations, and suggest that there may be a 'diversity threshold' for disease spread.

The most notable examples of the monoculture effect in natural populations come from the dramatic epidemics in small populations of endangered species, particularly mammals (for example, O'Brien et al., 1985; Thorne and Williams, 1988) . Genetic bottlenecks have reduced the genetic variability in cheetahs, particularly at the major histocompatibility complex, and endangered populations of these animals have been decimated by coronavirus epizootics (O'Brien et al., 1985) . Similarly, the endangered black-footed ferret may have been extirpated from its natural habitat, because low genetic diversity aided the spread of a virulent canine distemper epizootic (Thorne and Williams, 1988) .

Range expansion and habitat isolation caused by human activities can also generate small, founder populations with low genetic diversity. Newly-colonised, western populations of Italian agile frogs (Rana latastei) are genetically depauperate, and they have an increased susceptibility to a novel, emerging Ranavirus (Pearman and Garner, 2005) . Similarly, dam construction in the Senegal river basin likely permitted the rapid expansion of snails (Biomphalaria pfeifferi ), which serve as the first-intermediate host for the human disease schistosomiasis (Campbell et al., 2010) . Recently established Biomphalaria snail populations are genetically homogenous compared with those in natural habitats in Zimbabwe; they are also more susceptible to infection and this increases the opportunity for parasite transmission to humans (Campbell et al., 2010) .

By reducing individual-level and population-level genetic heterozygosity, inbreeding can increase host susceptibility to infectious parasites (Dwyer et al., 1997; Acevedo-Whitehouse et al., 2003; Spielman et al., 2004; Ellison et al., 2011) . In wild populations, Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. (2003) found that heavily inbred California sea lions were more infected, and consequently, may act as pathogen reservoirs, spreading parasites in sea lion populations. But, is increased susceptibility directly due to reduced diversity, or does inbreeding depression have an effect by compromising host condition? By manipulating the levels of inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster, in laboratory experiments Spielman et al. (2004) confirmed that the increase in disease susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population, and not by generalized inbreeding effects. Inbreeding effects were similarly excluded as a reason for why offspring from inbred populations of Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, were more susceptible to a vertically-transmitted parasite than those from outbred populations (Ebert et al., 2007) . Finally, Kerstes and Wagner (2012) found that inbreeding increased parasite-induced mortality in the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) by prolonging development time, but it did not increase susceptibility to infection.

Founder populations provide the opportunity to examine the effects of inbreeding and small population size on the link between genetic diversity and parasite resistance. For example, in a comparison of founder versus ancestral mainland populations of deer mice, Meagher (1999) found that inbred, island populations in Lake Michigan had higher infection levels and lower genetic diversity. The link between diversity and parasite spread has even been revealed when comparing large and small founder populations. Hawks colonizing smaller Galápagos Islands possessed lower genetic diversity, produced low antibody titer, and had a higher abundance of parasites than more outbred populations on larger islands (Whiteman et al., 2006) .

Uniparental forms of reproduction, such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis, should have similar consequences for parasite resistance as biparental inbreeding. Along these lines, self-fertilizing populations and inbred sexual populations were both found to have higher infection rates by a trematode parasite compared with outbred sexual populations of topminnows (Poeciliopsis monacha) (Lively et al., 1990) . In another species of partially-selfing fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), Ellison et al. (2011) found that outcrossing increased the genetic diversity of wild populations and decreased their susceptibility to multiple parasites.

Mating systems can also directly affect genetic diversity and parasite resistance (Busch et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2011) . For example, in eusocial insect colonies, queens can mate with a single male or with multiple males (polyandry), which determines the level of relatedness among individuals within a colony. High relatedness among individuals in a population can enhance the evolution of cooperation (Hamilton, 1964a (Hamilton, , b, 1987 , but the genetic similarity between individuals may also facilitate the spread of parasites (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel, 1991; Schmid-Hempel, 1998) . As such, multiple mating has been suggested as an evolutionary response to parasite pressure (Hamilton, 1987; Sherman et al., 1988) , which may counteract the high risk of parasite transmission and increase the overall productivity of the colony (Schmid-Hempel, 1994; Schmid-Hempel and Crozier, 1999; Brown and Schmid-Hempel, 2003) .

Numerous studies on ants and bees have indeed found that multiply mated queens form more resistant colonies Schmid-Hempel, 1999, 2001; Tarpy, 2003; Hughes and Boomsma, 2004; Tarpy and Seeley, 2006; Seeley and Tarpy, 2007) , and that offspring fathered by different males do vary in susceptibility to infection (Baer and Schmid-Hempel, 2003) . Ultimately, the balance between the costs (for example, within-colony conflict, reduced offspring output) and benefits (for example, resistance to a range of parasites) associated with heterogeneity in colonies may determine the optimal level of polyandry (Baer and Schmid-Hempel, 2001; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) . Polygyny (the presence of multiple queens within a single colony) can also decrease the relatedness among individuals and increase the variety of resistance alleles in the colony. Studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads (Liersch and Schmid-Hempel, 1998; Reber et al., 2008) . In addition, workers from polygynous colonies of an ant (Cardiocondyla obscurior) were better at detecting disease and removing infected individuals from the nest than workers from nests having a single queen (Ugelvig et al., 2010) .

Increases in infection prevalence in the wild is associated with genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding, induced by founder effects or mating systems. Thus, host population genetic diversity seems to have an important role in buffering populations against epidemics. But, how exactly does genetic diversity reduce disease spread?

HOW MUCH DIVERSITY IS NECESSARY? An association between genetic diversity and disease spread might be detected by categorizing populations as being either genetically homogenous or diverse. This comparative method can tell us that diversity matters, but does not indicate the amount of genetic diversity required for a population to be resistant, or the 'diversity threshold' . Recently, two insightful empirical studies have quantified the effect of genetic diversity on resistance in host populations. Altermatt and Ebert (2008) and Ganz and Ebert (2010) conducted semi-natural mesocosm and lab experiments, respectively, whereby monoclonal and polyclonal Daphnia populations were exposed to microparasites. Parasites spread significantly faster (Altermatt and Ebert, 2008) and infection rates are higher (Ganz and Ebert, 2010) in host monocultures compared with 'polycultures' of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity. These studies suggest that the relationship between host diversity and infection may not be complex, and that a 'handful' of host genotypes in the population can be enough to hamper parasite transmission.

The benefits of host genetic diversity, however, may also depend on the genetic diversity of the parasite population (Boomsma and Ratnieks, 1996; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006; Ganz and Ebert, 2010) . If the parasite population is genetically homogenous, increases in host population genetic diversity might boost the opportunity for parasites to encounter a susceptible host (Boomsma and Ratnieks, 1996; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) . Alternatively, in a diverse parasite population, there is a high probability that one of a diverse set of parasite genotypes can infect a homogeneous host population (Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) and genetically diverse host populations are at an advantage. Consistent with these ideas, Ganz and Ebert (2010) found no difference in infection levels among experimental Daphnia monocultures and polycultures when populations were exposed to a single-parasite genotype; however, polycultures were more resistant when populations were exposed to multiple parasite genotypes.

There has been surprisingly little theoretical work on the effect of genetic diversity on disease spread. Two models suggest that genetic variation in host susceptibility would not affect infectious disease spread (Springbett et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2006) , but it might reduce the severity of infection (Springbett et al., 2003) . In these models, hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain, but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection. In contrast, Lively (2010a) found that host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread, assuming that each host genotype was susceptible to a different parasite genotype. This assumption is consistent with the 'matching-alleles' model for infection (Frank, 1993; Otto and Michalakis, 1998) . The matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying self/non-selfrecognition systems in animals, and it is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity (Grosberg and Hart, 2000; Carius et al., 2001; Dybdahl et al., 2008; Duneau et al., 2011; Luijckx et al., 2011) . In addition, the framework seems robust to the assumption of singlegenotype specificity (Agrawal and Lively, 2002; Engelstaedter and Bonhoeffer, 2009) . The more recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations could have a large effect on disease spread and prevalence at equilibrium (Lively, 2010a) . The model assumes that there are no co-infections, and that each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population, which is the standard assumption of the matching-alleles model for infection. The results suggest that R 0 for each parasite genotype i depends on total host density, as well as the frequency of the matching host genotype, where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection. Thus, disease transmission is both density and frequency dependent. The effect of host density on R 0 is asymptotic on Bg i , where g i is the frequency of the matching host genotype, and B is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host (Lively, 2010a) . Thus, B is equal to the total number of propagules produced by an infection multiplied by the frequency of propagules that contact a host. For large host populations (N4200) the effect of further increasing the host population size has little effect; but, increasing the number of host genotypes has a large effect, because increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency (g i ) of each genotype. Under parasite-mediated, frequency-dependent selection, the frequency of each host genotype would be expected on average to be approximately 1/G, where G is the total number of host genotypes in the population. Under these conditions, R 0 for large populations is approximately B/G. This result suggests that experimentally doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce R 0 by one half, and that this would be roughly true even if the experiment increased the total number of hosts in the population (assuming the population is already large). The analytical results also suggest that the parasite would die out, following the addition of genetic diversity to the host population, provided that the frequency of each host genotype declines to less than 1/B. We used computer simulations to examine the gist of these ideas. The simulations assumed a haploid host with two loci coding for resistance. Each locus could have up to three alleles for a total of nine different genotypes. Each of the host genotypes could be infected by one of nine different parasite genotypes, consistent with the matching-alleles model for infection. In these simulations, birth rates of the host were density dependent, and infection reduced the intrinsic birth rate by 30% (the parameters where chosen for illustrative purposes). The details of the simulation are given in Lively (2010b) .

We began the simulation with two alleles at one locus and three alleles at the other locus, giving six possible host genotypes. An uninfected host population was initiated at carrying capacity (K ¼ 40 000), where the number of hosts of each genotype was determined by randomly assigning allele frequencies at the two loci. At generation 1, one host of each genotype was introduced as infected. Thereafter, the infected hosts of each genotype were introduced into the population with a probability of 0.02 per generation, to simulate immigration of infected individuals. We started by assuming B ¼ 9, meaning each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host. From the analytical results we would expect under that the average value for R 0 would be B/G ¼ 9/6 ¼ 1.5 (where G is the number of genotypes). As such, the pathogen would be expected to spread in the population, as was indeed the case (Figure 1a) . After an initial oscillatory period, the gene frequency dynamics stabilized (Figure 1a) , and the prevalence of infection also stabilized for the parameter values considered here (Figure 1b) . R 0 converged on the predicted value of 1.5 (Figure 1c) .

We then introduced a third allele at the second locus at generation 100, which increased the number of possible genotypes from six to nine. The allele quickly spread, as it conferred resistance on three of the nine possible genotypes for which there was no matching parasite genotype (Figure 1a ). Average R 0 quickly dropped to below 1 as the allele spread in the population (Figure 1c) , and the frequency of infection declined sharply (Figure 1b) . Matching parasite genotypes were introduced into the population by migration (at a rate of 0.02 per genotype per generation), which lead to selection against the new allele after it became common, as well as to a slight increase in R 0 (Figure 1c ). This resulted in sufficient selection to equalize allele frequencies so that the frequency of each genotype approximated 1/G. At this point, R 0 was equal to one (B/G ¼ 9/9 ¼ 1), and parasite prevalence fell close to zero, but was maintained at a low level by immigration (Figure 1b) . The point is that introducing a single novel allele in the host population increased the number of possible genotypes by 50%. This lead to virtual elimination of the parasite, as the prevalence of infection plummeted from about 60% to near zero. A reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population, and that the host population size remained large (that is, close to 40 000 individuals; results not shown). Clearly, under the assumptions of the present model, small increases in allelic diversity can cause dramatic reductions in parasitism, even in very large host populations. In addition, elimination of the pathogen is not necessarily followed by a loss of genetic diversity in the host population, as the different host genotypes are selectively neutral in the absence of parasite pressure (Figure 1a) .

The available data and the model are consistent with the idea that genetic diversity in host populations can reduce the spread of disease. However, a practical question arises: would the beneficial effect of adding hosts with novel genotypes, in order to increase local genetic diversity, outweigh the positive effect of increasing population size on R 0 ? A possible answer is also suggested by the model, which suggests that the effect of increasing population size on R 0 shows diminishing returns with host density, such that R 0 is asymptotic on B/G ( Figure 2 ). As such, while increasing host population size does strongly affect R 0 in small host populations, it has a small effect in large host populations (Figure 2 ). This suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence, even though host population size is also increased. The results in Figure 2 suggest that boosting genetic diversity could overcome the effect of increasing host population size, even when the latter is increased by fourfold.

Critically, the diversity threshold does not work by simply reducing the population size of the individual genotypes. The threshold, in fact, was calculated by assuming an infinite host population size. Rather it works by reducing the probability of successful infection by reducing the frequency of matching host genotypes for each parasite genotype.

Consistent with results from agricultural populations, the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread. Although observational studies from natural populations of vertebrates (for example, cheetahs, sea lions, fish and frogs) may have limitations, they strongly suggest that diversity matters, and their results are consistent with experimental studies on freshwater crustaceans and social insects. However, several questions remain:

(1) Does a diversity threshold exist? In other words, can parasites be eliminated by increasing host genetic diversity above some threshold value? (2) What are the relative effects of host density and host genetic diversity on disease spread? (3) What are the effects of genetic diversity in the parasite population versus that of the host population? (4) What is the heritability of parasite resistance in natural populations? Very little is known about the heritability for resistance in natural populations. It should be high in populations where genetic diversity is maintained by parasite-mediated frequencydependent selection.

These issues would be best addressed by data from natural populations. If parasites take hold or die out depending on how much host genetic diversity exists relative to the threshold, determining whether diversity thresholds exist in natural populations may have great value. This may be particularly helpful for conserving endangered species and mediating vector-human-parasite transmission.

There were no data to deposit. Figure 2 The effect of increasing genetic diversity on R 0 by adding new hosts. Suppose we have 100 hosts, with 10 genotypes in equal frequency (Point A). Now suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, without affecting the genetic diversity (Point B). We see an increase in R 0 , but the increase is not large. Now suppose we double the host population size, but also increase the number of genotypes from 10 to 20 (Point C). We now see a large decrease in R 0 , but it does not go below 1, so the disease can still spread. Finally, suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, but we also increase the number of genotypes by fourfold (Point D). Now R 0 not only deceases, but it goes below 1, so the disease will die out. Redrawn from Lively (2010a).

Molecular evolution and emergence of avian gammacoronaviruses,"Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.","The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses. High rates of mutation, short generation times and large population sizes drive their rapid evolution. A wide variety of animals, including humans, are affected and examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis A, B, and C virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and many others (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . Understanding viral evolution is important because it can lead to outbreaks of known diseases (e.g. the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza virus), host shifts and the emergence of new diseases (e.g. hantavirus), as well as escape from immune response and antiviral drugs (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus).

Because of their high mutation rates, RNA viruses exist as a genetically diverse population of related virus particles within a host. Genetic diversity, defined as a measure of all the genotypes (genetic variation), as well as the frequency of those genotypes in the population, is created by mutations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions, and recombination events that occur when the viral genome is replicated. Viral evolution is the result of a combination of high mutational input and the forces that act on the genetic diversity: selection both within and between hosts, which will increase the frequency of adaptive mutations and decrease the frequency of deleterious ones, and genetic drift during severe transmission bottlenecks, which will stochastically and indiscriminately affect the frequency of all types of mutation (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007; Manrubia and Lazaro, 2006) . The processes involved in the emergence and spread of RNA viruses can often be measured in real time, making them perfect candidates for the study of the evolution of infectious diseases (Holmes, 2009 ).

Coronaviruses are positive sense single stranded RNA viruses. Their viral genome is approximately 27-31 Kb in length, which is the largest of the positive sense single stranded RNA viruses. Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses reorganized the family Coronaviridae (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/p/1230.aspx). The Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales, are now divided into two subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae are further subdivided into genus Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus based on genetic analysis of the conserved domains in the replicase protein pp1ab and on the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The alpha and betacoronaviruses infect and cause disease in mammals whereas the gammacoronaviruses are largely avian viruses.

The most infamous coronavirus is SARS-CoV, which is currently placed in the betacoronavirus group. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-like viruses have a different gene order and sequence divergence distinct from many of the viruses in that group. In only a few months the virus rapidly spread to over 24 countries, infecting 8098 people and killing 774 (www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). Extensive testing and quarantine of infected individuals contained the outbreak. Although there are currently no known cases of SARS, surveillance continues and rapid recognition and response plans have been put into place. The SARS-CoV emerged from a reservoir of coronaviruses in bats that transmitted to an intermediate host then to humans . Thankfully it has not reemerged in humans.

Gammacoronaviruses frequently emerge in avian species. One example is turkey coronavirus (TCoV), which emerged from a recombination event that replaced the spike gene of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a virus of chickens, with a spike from an as yet unknown source. Another example is the repeated emergence of new genetic and antigenic types of IBV in chickens ( Fig. 1) , which leads to multiple serotypes of the virus that do not result in immunological cross protection.

Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease of chickens and a severe economic burden on the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The causative agent, IBV, has also been found in peafowl (Galliformes) and IBV-like viruses have been isolated from teal (Anas crecca), geese (Anserinae), pigeons (Columbiformes), and ducks (Anseriformes) (Cavanagh, 2007) . Clinical signs of the disease in chickens are watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea, gasping, coughing, and tracheal rales. The disease can also cause a decrease in egg production and egg quality, and some strains of the virus can cause an interstitial nephritis. When secondary pathogens like avian mycoplasmas, Escherichia coli, Ornithobacterium rhinotrachealie, and/or Bordetella avium complicate the disease, pneumonia, airsaculitis and peritonitis can occur. Morbidity is almost always 100% Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic tree of different strains of avian coronavirus IBV showing S1 glycoprotein amino acid sequence relatedness. The sequences were aligned using Clustal W and the Neighbor-Joining method was used to reconstruct the phylogeny (DNASTAR, Inc., v.8.0.2, Madison, WI).

whereas mortality can be quite variable depending on the age of the birds, strain of the virus and secondary pathogens involved in the disease and can range from 14% to 82% (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The virus replicates in epithelial cells causing lesions in the nasal turbinates, trachea, kidney, gonads, oviduct, lungs and airsacs. Lesions can also be found in the gastrointestinal tract, bursa of Fabricius and cecal tonsils.

The IBV virion has a typical coronavirus pleomorphic shape with the characteristic club-shaped surface projections designated spikes (Perlman et al., 2008 ). The enveloped virus particle is heat labile, unstable at extreme pH, and sensitive to most disinfectants. The viral genome is 5 0 capped, with a poly-A tail and the gene organization is 5 0 UTR-1a/1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3 0 UTR.

The 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs contain structural motifs that are involved with interactions between the UTRs as well as with viral encoded replicase proteins and possibly host proteins (Li et al., 2008) . The UTRs play a key role in viral RNA transcription and replication. The 1a and 1ab ORFs encode polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) by two viral proteases, a papain-like protease (PLP) and the main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like protease (van Hemert et al., 2008) . In contrast to the alpha and betacoronaviruses, which have 16 nsps, nsp1 is lacking in gammacoronaviruses (see Table 1 ).

The 1ab polyprotein is translated through a À 1 frame-shift at nucleotide position 12,466 (in IBV/Mass41/41, AY851295) that occurs approximately 20-40% of the time (Imbert et al., 2008) . The Nsp 2 has been shown to play a role in facilitating de novo IBV protein synthesis by blocking protein kinase R (PKR) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha), which shuts down protein synthesis. In addition, Nsp 2 induces expression of GADD34, a component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha (Wang et al., 2009 ). The Nsp 3 contains multiple domains including an acidic domain, an ADP-ribose 1 phosphatase, the papain-like protease (PLP), a Y domain and a transmembrane domain (Imbert et al., 2008; Neuman et al., 2008) . The PLP of IBV and, interestingly, also SARS-CoV, is orthologous to PLP2 of other coronaviruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The PLP1 in IBV is truncated whereas in SARS-CoV it is missing altogether (Barretto et al., 2005; Ziebuhr et al., 2007) . The PLP is responsible for cleaving between Nsps 2-3 and 3-4 and has been shown to contain deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities (Clementz et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2009; Lindner et al., 2005) . The Nsp 4 is a membrane spanning protein and along with Nsps 2 and 6 is thought to anchor the viral replication complex in double membrane vesicles at the golgi (Graham et al., 2008) . Nonstructural protein 5 contains Mpro, a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Ziebuhr, 2006) . The Mpro is responsible for cleaving Nsps 4 through 16. Nonstructural proteins 6 through 10 are membrane-localized proteins some of which have RNA binding activity and likely play a role in formation of the viral replication complex (Johnson et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2007; Tangudu et al., 2007; Zhai et al., 2005; Ziebuhr, 2006) . Nonstructural protein 11/12 is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), Nsp 13 contains the RNA helicase, Nsp 14 contains an exoribonuclease domain, Nsp 15 has an endoribonuclease domain, and Nsp 16 is a methyltransferase (Graham et al., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005 Ziebuhr, , 2006 .

Structural protein genes are located at the 3 0 end of the genome. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved in IBV into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain responsible for virus attachment to host cells and the S2 subunit, which is noncovalently attached to S1 has a trans-membrane domain that spans the viral membrane and anchoring the spikes to the virion. The S glycoprotein is also involved in virus and cell membrane fusion and entry into the host cell, and it contains epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. Variability in the S1 gene is responsible for the multiple different genetic and antigenic types of the virus (see Fig. 1 ). The E protein is an integral membrane protein and the M protein is a membrane spanning protein. Both are involved with virus assembly. The N protein binds to the viral genome, plays a role in viral RNA replication and in virion assembly.

It is well documented that multiple serotypes of IBV exist that do not cross-neutralize (Fabricant, 1998) . Genetic information for the S gene strongly suggests that different serotypes, as defined by neutralizing antibodies, exist for many other coronaviruses. However, they have only been reported for feline coronavirus (FCoV) types I and II, and there is some evidence that two serotypes may exist for SARS-CoV (Decaro et al., 2009; Hohdatsu et al., 1991) . In addition to multiple serotypes of IBV, there are countless variant viruses, some of which may also fail to cross react in a virus neutralization test. Multiple different serotypes with little or no cross protection makes control of IBV, which is primarily through the use of attenuated live vaccines, extremely challenging.

Avian coronavirus IBV creates genetic diversity through rapid replication and large population sizes coupled with a high mutation rate and recombination. Mutations include substitutions, which are the result of a high error rate and limited proof reading 

The average rate of synonymous mutation in all coronaviruses including IBV is approximately 1.2 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al., 2004; Holmes, 2009 ). The rate of other RNA viruses with smaller genomes can be as high as 1 Â 10 À1 substitutions/ site/year. The difference is presumably due to the presence of a 3 0 to 5 0 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain in Nsp 14, which contains similarities to host proteins involved in proofreading and repair (Minskaia et al., 2006; Snijder et al., 2003) . Using an nsp 14-ExoN mutant SARS-CoV, Eckerle et al. (2010) showed impaired growth and a 21-fold increase in mutation rate for the mutant virus compared to wild type. That data and their previous work with a mouse hepatitis virus coronavirus (MHV-CoV) ExoN mutant (Eckerle et al., 2007) , confirms that ExoN, which is conserved in all coronaviruses, does contribute to the fidelity of the viral RdRp. High fidelity of the polymerase results in a higher ''error threshold'' and likely permits the virus to maintain a large genome size (Holmes, 2009) .

The emergence of new strains and serotypes of IBV is largely due to the accumulation of mutations in the S gene over time as opposed to recombination events. This is thought to be the primary method of cross-species transmission and was shown to lead to the emergence of SARS-CoV (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004; Hon et al., 2008) .

Recombination can reduce mutational load, create genetic variants that may be very different from parental strains, and result in the emergence of new strains (Worobey and Holmes, 1999) . Recombination has been reported in many coronaviruses (Brooks et al., 2004; Lee and Jackwood, 2000; Magiorkinis et al., 2004; Thor et al., 2011) . Recombination hot spots, or regions of the viral genome with higher incidences of recombination breakpoints, have been reported in IBV. Hot spots (see Fig. 2 ) tend to lie immediately upstream of the S glycoprotein gene, as well as in nsp 2, nsp 3, and nsp 16 (Armesto et al., 2009; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Thor et al., 2011) . Recombination in the nonstructural proteins associated with the RdRp can alter replication efficiency of the virus, which can in turn affect pathogenicity.

Because the S glycoprotein gene is involved in host cell attachment and contains viral neutralizing epitopes, recombination in the S glycoprotein gene can result in the emergence of new strains or serotypes of the virus as well as new viruses capable of causing disease in other host species. The emergence of new variants and serotypes of IBV, whether the result of mutations or recombination, occurs continuously (Jackwood et al., 2005) . Recombination directly leading to the emergence of a new avian coronavirus in turkeys (TCoV) was recently documented. The S gene of IBV recombined with an unknown virus, which altered its pathotype (respiratory to enteric) and host specificity (chicken to turkey), resulting in the emergence of TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Data from that study showed that the full-length genomes of IBV and TCoV are greater than 86% similar whereas the spike glycoproteins are less than 36% similar with clear recombination break points at the 3 0 end of gene 1ab (nucleotide position 20,173) immediately upstream of the S gene and in the 3 0 end of the spike gene (nucleotide position 23,849) (Jackwood et al., 2010) . It is likely that the unknown virus contributing S gene sequences in the emergence of TCoV is another avian coronavirus, since the only evidence of a gamma coronavirus recombining with either an alpha or beta coronavirus is the mosaic composition reported for the SARS-CoV .

Control of infectious bronchitis virus in commercial poultry is through the use of live attenuated and killed vaccines. Since little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes or different variants of the virus, a variety of different virus antigenic types are used in vaccines. Typically more than one immunization is given and multivalent vaccines containing two or more antigenic types are used in an attempt to provide broad protection. It is not uncommon for vaccines to induce only partial protection against varied antigenic types of the virus, which allows some viruses to continue to replicate and persist in a flock. Presumably replication of the virus in a vaccinated host provides it with an opportunity to further adapt and evade the immune response (Gandon and Day, 2008; Gandon et al., 2001) .

The use of modified live vaccine can result in faster evolutionary rates in IBV. Mutation rates for the 793/B IBV type where vaccines against that specific serotype were not used have been estimated to be 3 Â 10 À3 substitutions/site/year (Cavanagh et al., 1998) , whereas the GA98 virus, which emerged in the face of vaccination with the closely related DE072 type was reported to have a mutation rate of 1.5 Â 10 À2 substitutions/site/year (Lee and Jackwood, 2001) . However, caution must be exercised when estimating mutation rates of IBV antigenic types when live attenuated vaccines against that same virus type are used. Mutation rates for Mass and Conn IBV types, where live vaccines against those types are commonly used, were estimated to be 1.9 Â 10 À3 and 1.5 Â 10 À4 nucleotide changes/site/year, respectively (McKinley et al., 2011) . Reisolation of vaccine viruses that are continuously introduced into the field and circulating in birds for a relatively short period of time likely contributed to the apparently low mutation rates.

Emergence of new variants or serotypes of IBV is dependent on the ability of existing strains to be transmitted from one individual to another. The average number of new infections caused by one infected individual (reproductive number, R), is a measure of the sustainability of a virus in the host population. For R < 1, the chain of transmission is not sustainable and the disease slowly dies out. For R > 1, the number of infected hosts increases, which in some cases can result in an epidemic. Eventually the pool of susceptible hosts is sufficiently depleted (or intervention measures are imple- mented) and R drops to below 1. The reproductive number for the situation where all hosts are susceptible (basic reproductive number, R 0 ) is a measure of the transmissibility of a given pathogen. The R 0 value for IBV has been estimated to be 19.95, which is extremely high (comparable to highly transmissible human diseases such as measles) and reflects the highly infectious nature of this virus (de Wit et al., 1998) . Vaccination with a homologous antigenic type of the virus was found to reduce R 0 to 0.69 indicating that proper and careful vaccination with a well-matched vaccine is an effective control strategy for IBV (de Wit et al., 1998) .

Transmission of a virus from one individual to another individual often involves a bottleneck where only a small number of virions are transmitted. Severely restricted transmission bottlenecks have been predicted for HIV, where studies suggest that new infections are started by a single virion (Abrahams et al., 2009) . In contrast, a more recent study on equine influenza virus showed that although the consensus sequence did not vary, genetically distinct subpopulations of the virus were transmitted to a new susceptible host, suggesting a somewhat less restrictive transmission bottleneck .

Theoretically, transmission through a restrictive bottleneck followed by rapid expansion of the number of virus particles in the host can take a rare virus subpopulation and make it the predominant type, potentially leading to the emergence of a new genotype. Whether this is the mechanism behind the emergence of new types of IBV is not known because there exists little in vivo experimental data on bottlenecks and expansion of viruses transmitting and replicating in their natural animal host. There is a substantial body of experimental studies in the laboratory, especially using bacteriophages, that have addressed a variety of evolutionary factors including transmission bottlenecks and the dynamics of adaptation, (reviewed in (Elena and Sanjuan, 2007) ). However, in vivo experiments in animal hosts have usually involved only two or a few individuals, which makes predicting viral evolution as a virus is transmitted through several hosts (i.e. over many transmission events) extremely difficult (Bouma et al., 2009; Coffey et al., 2008; Hoelzer et al., 2010; van der Goot et al., 2005) . While studies are being performed to try to bridge the gap between the laboratory and nature, it is a challenging task. Consequently, there is a critical need for studies that utilize multiplehost chains of transmission similar to those used in vitro, but where host to host transmission events involve natural infections, in an experimental setting that allows for accurate measurements of viral evolution at critical time points. Understanding transmission and development of viral genetic diversity in a natural setting will hopefully elucidate the mechanisms behind the emergence of different genetic and antigenic types of IBV, allowing us to prevent, or at least to better predict the emergence of new coronavirus diseases. The rapid evolution of IBV makes this virus an excellent model to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.

Mathematical models, on their own or in combination with experimental data, have proven to be useful for understanding various aspects of viral dynamics and evolution. Examples of topics that have received significant modeling attention are the estimation of transmissibility (R 0 ) (Kenah, 2011; Roberts, 2007) , the evolution of drug resistance Lipsitch et al., 2007; Temime et al., 2008; Wodarz and Nowak, 2000) , the impact of bottlenecks (Campos and Wahl, 2009; Elena et al., 2001; Escarmis et al., 2006; Handel and Bennett, 2008; Manrubia et al., 2005; Novella et al., 2008) , and the impact of different fitness landscapes on evolutionary trajectories (Antia et al., 2003; Clune et al., 2008; Handel and Rozen, 2009) .

Some of these mathematical modeling approaches have been applied to coronaviruses, specifically the SARS-CoV. Early in the SARS epidemic, data was used to estimate the reproductive number and the impact of potential control strategies (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Riley et al., 2003) . Other modeling studies investigated aspects such as the likely route of transmission of SARS-CoV (Yu et al., 2004) , the impact of contact structure (Meyers et al., 2005) , the impact of control measures that were implemented (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) and the impact of travel on possible future SARS outbreaks (Ruan, 2009) . With regard to evolutionary questions, models have been used to estimate the timing of the emergence of the common ancestor of the SARS-CoV epidemic strain (Lu et al., 2004) and to better understand its reservoir (Song et al., 2005) .

Other coronaviruses, including IBV, have to our knowledge not been modeled, but a combination of the experimental approaches outlined above with appropriate models seems to be a promising direction to gain general insights into evolutionary dynamics, as well as to help with the further development of effective IBV control strategies. The recent availability and reduced cost of quantitative, deep-sequencing methods should aid in providing data in the future that will be ideally suited for mathematical and statistical modeling to estimate relevant parameters, and predict transmission dynamics.

Compared to other coronaviruses, multiple serotypes and variant viruses that continue to adapt and change appears to be unique to IBV, and makes diagnosis and control of IBV extremely challenging. Traditional virus neutralization tests conducted in embryonated eggs are expensive and time consuming, taking weeks or months to type only a few viruses. Currently, molecular typing tests that involve RT-PCR amplification of the S1 gene followed by nucleotide sequence analysis is being used to inexpensively determine the genetic type of a number of viruses in a short period of time. In addition, since the S1 gene of inactivated viruses can be amplified and sequenced, viruses can be imported (with the proper permits) from abroad. This along with an explosion of genetic data available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) has allowed genetic comparison of IBV isolates from all over the world, significantly improving epidemiological data and attempts to control the disease (Callison et al., 2001) .

Identification of the IBV type causing an outbreak in commercial poultry is necessary to be able to choose the appropriate vaccine(s) capable of inducing a protective immune response. Because only a few vaccine types, and in many countries only one vaccine (Mass type H120) can be used, variant viruses persist and outbreaks continue to occur (Gelb et al., 1991; Ignjatovic et al., 2006; Jackwood et al., 2005 Jackwood et al., , 2009 . Evolutionary rates for IBV are so rapid that even live attenuated vaccines undergo selection and mutation following only a single round of infection in the host. One study compared reisolated vaccine viruses with the original vaccine virus administered to the bird and found that selection of subpopulations as well as mutations were occurring in the S1 gene (McKinley et al., 2008) . Another study found distinct virus subpopulations in the S1 gene were selected when chickens were vaccinated with the Ark-DPI strain of IBV (van Santen and Toro, 2008) . Further analysis found that virus subpopulations were different in the microenvironment of distinct tissues of the host (Gallardo et al., 2010) . These data indicate that different selection pressures leading to evolution of the virus during replication in the host can result in an even higher degree of virus diversity.

A wide variety of genetic and antigenic variants of avian coronavirus IBV, coupled with continuous emergence of new types, make this virus an ideal model to study viral evolution. Multiple infected hosts, high replication within hosts, and high mutation rates, lead to an extraordinarily diverse population of virus particles, which facilitates the evolution of the virus. Determining the size of bottlenecks during transmission, and the changes in virus genetic diversity during single and multiple infection cycles and how these affect transmission is important for evaluating the role of drift and selection on evolution, which is critical for the control of outbreaks of infectious bronchitis as well as other known coronaviral diseases. In addition, that knowledge is an important step in understanding the evolution of RNA viruses, which will make it possible to take a proactive approach to preventing the emergence of new coronaviral diseases.

"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3","(porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)-like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.","Continuous epidemiological surveillance of emerging viruses is crucial to control widespread. [1] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the family Circoviridae comprises two genera: Cyclovirus and Circovirus. Viruses from the genus Cyclovirus have been found in humans and chimpanzees. [2] Circoviruses have a wide host range, including human, [2, 3] birds, [4, 5] pigs, [6, 7] dogs, [8] and cattle. [9, 10] Before to 2015, porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) and PCV2 were considered the only types of porcine circoviruses. PCV1 is nonpathogenic to pigs and was identified in the porcine kidney cell line PK-15. [6, 11] PCV2 is associated with significant clinical signs such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), and immunosuppression. [2, 6, 10] In the late 1990s, the first PCV2 outbreak was identified [12, 13] and soon PCV2 became endemic causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. Its high evolutionary rate, the highest recorded for a single-stranded DNA virus until now, could allow an evolutionary dynamics similar to that of single-stranded RNA viruses. [13] The genotype identification of PCV2 was first proposed by the European project in 2008 based on p-distance of neighbor joining (NJ) trees. [14] However, it was questioned by Franzo et al. and others [12, 15, 16] when more sequences became available. Until now, there are three major confirmed genotypes including: PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d, and two genotypes with low prevalence, PCV2c and PCV2e. [16] [17] [18] [19] Genotype shifts may be associated with differences in pathogenicity and vaccine immunity. [12] New standard methods to define PCV2 genotypes are necessary to adapt vaccines to the rapid emergence of new genotypes. [20] Although PCV2 is the cause of big economic losses to the pig industry, there is uncertainty surrounding its origin and evolution. Recently, a novel circovirus was identified by next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of aborted fetuses of sows and named PCV3. [21, 22] The newly discovered virus was associated with PDNS. [23] PCV3 infection might contribute to PDNS and reproductive failure, cardiac, and multisystemic inflammation. [10, 21, 24] It has also been shown that PCV3 found in aborted fetuses is the result of vertical transmission. [21] Like PCV2, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of PCV3: ORF1 encodes proteins involved in viral replication (Rep) and ORF2 encodes a major structural protein, the capsid protein (Cap). [25] PCV3 sequences were detected widely in the USA, [21] China, [26] [27] [28] Brazil, [29] Thailand, [30] Korea, [23] and many European countries, [22, [31] [32] [33] [34] including Poland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, the UK among others. The PCV3 that was first identified in the USA was more closely related to canine circovirus although with weak bootstrap support. [21] Subsequently, with PCV3 detected in China and other countries, a study reported that it was closely related to some bat circoviruses. [24] Additionally, it was considered that canine CVs and some bat CVs may share a common ancestor within the cluster containing PCV1 and PCV2. [35] Previous studies on the origin of PCV3 are difficult to interpret and compare since different phylogenetic methods and reference sequences were applied. [21, 24, 26] Although phylogenetic analysis is a powerful tool and is now widely used for investigating the evolution of PCV3, there are a large number of different inference methods and a lack of uniformity in the use of these methods by different studies. [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] 29, 31, 33] Considering the controversy of the origin of PCV3 (bat or canine), [21, 24, 26] we analyzed the selected available ORF1 circovirus sequences using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to trace more accurately the origin of PCV3. Additionally, all available complete PCV3 sequences deposited in GenBank until November 2017 were analyzed by NJ, ML, and MCMC methods to study the molecular genetic relationship. Our results provide a global view of the origin, genetic divergence, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 and indicate positive selection and high evolutionary rate, supporting the ongoing genotype shift and outbreaks.

RDP4 was used to detect recombination. We detected no recombination. However, the KY418606 sequence was removed due to low quality. To trace the origin of PCV3, a ML tree (Figure 1a ) was reconstructed using ORF1 gene sequences. We found that all the PCV3 strains were closely related to the clade 1 bat CVs (which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013) with a high confidence (bootstrap = 86). The bat virus Rhinolophus ferrumequinum circovirus 1 from China (JQ814849) acted as an outgroup of the clade 1 bat CVs and the PCV3 strains, indicating a potential bat CV origin. Additionally, we also found that the PCV2 and PCV1 strains were closely related to the clade 2 bat CVs in the study of Wu et al. [35] We also discovered that canine CVs are closely related to clade 2 bat CVs and PCV1 and PCV2 strains. However, it was previously reported that canine CVs were closely related to PCV3 strains when comparing complete genomes, although with low bootstrap values. [21] This supports the idea that the conserved Rep protein should be used when inferring the origin of porcine circoviruses in the future. Furthermore, the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructed with 81 of the 101 ORF1 sequences (Figure 1b ) showed similar topology with the ML tree, and evidenced a close relationship with clade 1 bat CVs with uncertain divergence time due to the insufficient numbers of sequences currently available (Table S1, Supporting Information).

We used ML, MCC, and NJ methods to reconstruct the phylogenies of PCV3 complete coding sequences (ORF1+ORF2). Two independent clades were observed in the three different trees which displayed similar structures (Figure 2a [21] Moreover, the PCV3a clade could be separated into two individual subclades with stable structures, termed PCV3a-1 and PCV3a-2. We observed that the distribution of several strains was random in the PCV3a clade and we referred to these strains as intermediate strains (IM).

However, the NJ and ML tree constructed using ORF2 did not display clear clusters, especially in NJ tree. For example, in the NJ tree constructed with 109 ORF2 sequences, some of the strains in PCV3a-IM clustered with PCV3b ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). The phylogenies did not remain consistent when the number of reference sequences of the ORF2 gene increased. Therefore, we suggest using complete coding sequences for PCV3 genotyping.

The time of most recent ancestor (tMRCA) and nucleotide substitution rate of the complete coding sequences and individual genes were estimated using BEAST (v1.8.4). Both the mean value and 95% HPD (high posterior destiny) were included (Figure 4 ). The tMRCA of PCV3a was 2013.04 (95% HPD: 2011.69-2013.99). In detailed, the estimations of the tMRCA of PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3b were 2013.80, 2013.61, 2013.44, respectively, which suggests that the PCV3a clade experienced a rapid expansion in 2013. Additionally, the tMRCA of ORF2 and ORF1 was also estimated and showed a similar pattern with complete coding sequences (Table S2 , Supporting Information). Overall, the mean tMRCA of PCV3 of the last three years was in late 2013 based on individual gene or complete coding sequence analysis.

Additionally, the mean substitution rate of the complete coding sequences of all the strains was 1.69 × 10 −3 substitutions/site/year, which was higher than previously reported for PCV1 (1.15 × 10 −5 ), [36] but closer to PCV2 (1.2 × 10 −3 ) (Table S2 , Supporting Information). [13] Furthermore, to get more detailed information on the phylogenetic evolution of PCV3, the substitution rates were estimated according to specific clades and the individual genes. As shown in Figure 4 , the substitution rates of different clades in terms of the complete coding sequences were 2.1 × 10 −3 in the PCV3a-1 and PCV3b clades and 1.6 × 10 −3 in the PCV3a-2 clade. Additionally, we observed that the ORF2 gene experienced similar evolution compared to the ORF1 gene (Table S2, Supporting  Information) .

Based on the skyline plot and MCC tree, we found that PCV3 might have diversified from the second half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 ( Figure 3a ). In addition, the various branches of PCV3 (PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, and PCV3b) also formed around this time ( Figure 3b ).

Moreover, we investigated the epidemiological dynamics of emerging PCV3 worldwide. We found considerable temporal variation in the estimates of the effective reproductive number (Re) using sequences from 2015-2017. Despite distinct phylogenetic histories, PCV3a and PCV3b exhibited similar Re values of 3.08 (PCV3a, 95% HPD: 0.82-7.96) and 1.82 (PCV3b, 95% HPD: 0.63-4.86) ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information) based on epidemiological modeling in 2016. This suggests the potential to become endemic in pigs, at least if compared to human influenza viruses. [37] Considering the limited number of sequences for 2015 and 2017, the Re value of 2016 was considered valid.

The association of geographical distribution of PCV3 indicated that the p value of both association index (AI) and parsimony score (PS) were less than 0.05. The p value of monophyletic clade (MC) observed in China was less than 0.05 (Table 1), indicating that the geographic relevance of PCV3 in China is significant (a significant association was also observed in Italy but a low number of sequences was analyzed). However, the p values of the USA, South Korea, and Brazil were greater than 0.05. The association of the geographical distribution of PCV3 is displayed in the Figure S3 (Supporting Information) map. In general, there was a correlation between PCV3 and geography, although the correlation was weak based on the relatively small number of available sequences.

A total of 56 PCV3 complete coding sequences were used for amino acid analysis of the related clades (Table S3 , Supporting Information). Amino acid sites 122, 320, and 323 were crucial to distinguish PCV3a and PCV3b. Compared to PCV3a, these amino acid sites were S122A, A320V, R323K, respectively, in PCV3b while R323K in PCV3a-IM. These results further validate the genotyping results we obtained based on the phylogenetic structure. In addition, epitope prediction indicated that there are seven potential epitopes in PCV3a and PCV3b (Table S4 , Supporting Information). For PCV3, the epitopes span almost the whole surface of the protein, which are indicated with different colors in Figure 5 . The detailed information about the epitopes is shown in Table S4 (Supporting Information). Combining epitope prediction with amino acid analysis, we found that amino acid site 24 of ORF2 (corresponding to site 320 of the complete coding sequence) is located in a predicted epitope region. As mentioned before, site 24 of PCV3a and PCV3b was different and, as seen in Figure 5 , the epitope structures of PCV3a and PCV3b are different. This may indicate that the antigenicity of PCV3a and PCV3b is different. Further experimental studies are warranted to verify the differences in the immunogenicity of the predicted epitope regions.

We found that among the individual codons, 3 codons (sites 5, 122, and 320) were considered to be under positive selection with p values less than 0.1 ( Table 2) . Codons 122, located in the ORF1 coding region, and 320, corresponding to the amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 coding region, were confirmed to be under positive selection by at least two methods with p < 0.05 by FEL (fixed effects likelihood) and MEME (mixed effects model of evolution), p < 0.1 by SLAC (single-likelihood ancestor counting), and a posterior probability >0.9 by FUBAR (fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation).

Since the discovery of PCV3 in 2015, most studies have focused on the genetic characterization of individual isolates and on clinical and epidemiological investigations. [22, 23, 25, 38] Here, we provide new insight into the origin, epidemiology, and evolution of PCV3. We determined, with better accuracy than previous reports, the origin of PCV3 and proposed an evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of PCV3 worldwide. First, we used conserved coding sequences (ORF1) to trace the potential origin, which was a better and more accurate approach than those previously applied to complete genomes. [21, 24, 26] We found that clade 1 bat CVs which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013 shared the most recent common ancestor with PCV3. Interestingly, we found several differences with previous reports. First, the pig NW2/USA/2009 strain clustered with the PCV3 clade, which was previously reported to sit as a sole outgroup in the phylogeny. [24] Therefore, we assume that the emergence of PCV3 was before its first detection in 2009 in pigs. However, the accurate origin and divergence time need deep epidemiological surveys to be confirmed. Second, compared to previous studies, [21, 24, 26] more reference sequences were included and we confirmed that PCV3 actually diversified from a clade 1 bat CVs. [35] Furthermore, in accordance with a previous study, we found that PCV1 and PCV2 were closely related to the clade 2 Bat CVs, [35] but not birds. [13] Overall, clade 1 bat CVs are the most likely origin of PCV3 based on the currently available sequences. Generally, bats are considered to be important reservoirs of novel emerging infectious diseases. Circovirus host jumps may be a risk for both the pig industry and public health, similar to the recently reported bat-origin coronavirus detected in pigs. [39, 40] Given that previously recognized NJ p-distance methods that identified PCV2 genotype were questioned by Franzo et al., [15] we explored the phylogenetic history of PCV3 based on recent outbreak strains. [41, 42] For the genotype identification of PCV3, three different algorithms, NJ, ML, and MCC, were used and two stable clades were identified (PCV3a and PCV3b). Additionally, within the PCV3a clade, two stable subclades and flexible IM clades were identified. Compared to previous studies, [24, 31] Adv. Sci. 2018, 5, 1800275 the topologies of the trees provided here, deduced using complete coding sequences, were more stable and accurate ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information). On the other hand, amino acid analysis revealed that S122A and A320V were vital in differentiating the PCV3a and PCV3b clades. Although genotype identification combined with amino acid analysis has been reported by Fu et al. [24] and Fux et al., [31] it is essential to note that: i) both studies included the low sequencing quality strain KY418606 (which has been revised after the two studies were published), misleading the topology of the phylogeny; ii) the subgenotype identification of the two studies was not based on full genomes, while complete coding sequences were used The bold representing the p < 0.05 and posterior probability >0.9, with significant difference. here; and iii) the stable topologies observed in our phylogenetic trees reconstructed with complete coding sequences were confirmed by principle component analysis (PCA) using different sequences in one of our unpublished studies. Therefore, accurate phylogenetic trees and genotype identification of PCV3 should be deduced using unrooted ML trees of complete coding sequences in the future. Phylodynamic analysis revealed that the divergence of PCV3a was earlier than PCV3b. We believe that the short divergence time identified for PCV3a and PCV3b is due to a lack of adequate number of PCV3 sequences. The skyline plot revealed a rapid increase and expansion of the PCV3 population from late 2013 to early 2014. In addition, during this period, PCV3a and PCV3b were formed. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to Re = R0). Re must always be less than or equal to R0 by definition. If the value of R0 or Re is more than one, an epidemic may occur. [43] We estimated that the Re of PCV3a and 3b were 3.18 (CI: 0.82-7.96) and 1.82 (CI: 0.63-4.86) in 2016, respectively. Additionally, the high substitution rate of PCV2 within single stranded DNA virus, enabled it to experience an evolutionary dynamics similar to single stranded RNA viruses and, therefore, enhanced the global emergence of PCVD. [13] Interestingly, the substitution rate of PCV3 was relatively higher than PCV2, which might facilitate PCV3 to adapt to different biological conditions and pose a greater threat to the swine population. Overall, these estimated results were consistent with the actual epidemic of PCV3 and indicate that both PCV3a and 3b have high potential for widespread transmission in the future. Thus, epidemiological investigation to prevent this novel disease is crucial. Moreover, our analysis revealed epidemiological features associated with the geographical distribution in China, which might indicate that once PCV3 strains establish into specific areas, they might adapt to the local hosts. Importantly, amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 protein (codon of 320 in the complete coding region) was predicted as a potential epitope and to be under positive selection. This site may be pivotal to the escape of PCV3 from the host immune system leading to a prolonged period of circulation and the divergence of the PCV3a to the PCV3b clade. [44] In conclusion, we confirmed the more accurate bat origin of PCV3, and provided a comprehensive genotype identification. Additionally, we report for the first time that PCV3 replaced PCV2 and became the single stranded DNA virus with highest substitution rate. The rapid increase population and relative high Re value reveals the possibility of a continuous outbreak in the future. Overall, our study aids the understanding of ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.

Sequence Datasets-Multiple Circoviruses Datasets: All the sequences were obtained from the GenBank database of NCBI (November 2017, Table S1, Supporting Information) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A total of 57 PCV3 strains were analyzed in this study. In addition, 101 ORF1 coding sequences of different circoviruses which were previously reported, [12, 21, 24, 35] including 13 PCV2 strains, 2 PCV1 strains, 9 bat CVs, 20 other host circoviruses, and 1 strain detected from a pork sample were also included.

Sequence Datasets-PCV3 Datasets: A total of 57 complete coding sequences (ORF1 + ORF2) were analyzed. The noncoding regions were deleted and the coding sequences were split into two representing ORF1 (Rep) and ORF2 (Cap). Given that ORF2 is in the opposite orientation, the individual ORFs were downloaded and then concatenated. Additionally, 109 individual ORF2 gene encoding capsid proteins were included.

Recombination Detection: Recombination analysis was performed based on the approaches applied in RDP4. [45] A total of seven methods were applied, including GENECONV, [46] RDP, [47] Chimaera, [48] SiScan, [49] 3Seq, [50] MaxChi, [51] LARD. [52] Recombination had to be confirmed by at least four of the seven methods with p value cut-off of 0.05. Bonferroni correction was applied throughout the analysis.

Sequence Alignment and Model Test: Sequences were aligned by ClustalW implemented in MEGA 7. [53] The best substitution model was selected by jModelTest according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score.

Origin and Phylogenetic Analysis: To date the origin of PCV3, a ML tree was reconstructed with 101 amino acid sequences of the Rep protein using RAxML with PROTCATLG model and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The lineages closely related to PCV3, PCV2, and PCV1 were used to infer the divergence time. The MCC trees were inferred by BEAST (v1. 8.4) with the nucleotide sequences of the ORF1 gene using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with four discrete gamma categories (HKY + G). Additionally, to identified PCV3 genotypes, three distinct methods were used including: MCC tree using BEAST (v1.8.4), [54] ML tree using RAxML, [55] and NJ tree using MEGA7. [53] The p-distance methods were used to infer the NJ tree with 1000 bootstraps replication.

Evolutionary Dynamics of PCV3: Bayesian MCMC methods within the BEAST (v1.8.4) package were used to estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the evolutionary rates. [56] The nucleotide substitution model was general time reversible substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR+I+G), assuming an uncorrected relaxed clock (lognormal). A Bayesian skyline coalescent model was set to estimate the efficient population size. Two independent runs were operated with a chain length of 1 × 10 8 generations and sampled at every 10 000 generations. [57] Convergence was estimated based on the software Tracer (v1.6) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) after a burn-in of 10%. Parameters with effective sampling size (ESS) > 200 were accepted. The final MCC trees were replayed in Figtree (v1.4.3) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). BaTS (Bayesian tip-significance testing) was used to analyze the correlation among the PCV3 sequences and geographical structure. [58] The countries of each sequence were used as the taxon labels, such as China, USA, Korea, Italy, and Brazil. The AI and PS statistic were calculated using the BEAST MCC tree to obtain statistical support. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Also, the worldwide geographical distribution of PCV3 was marked in the map ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information).

Effective Reproduction Number (Re): Re values were calculated using follow formula (1)

Among these parameters, R is the effective reproduction number, λ is the birth rate, μ is the death rate, ρ is the sampling probability. [59] BEAST (v2.4.7) was used to estimate the Re. The GTR+G nucleotide substitution model was chosen and the Birth death skyline contemporary model with sampling proportion was set to 0. The chain length was 1 × 10 7 , every 1000 generations resampled one time. Two independent runs were performed and log files were combined using LogCombiner.

Predicting the Structure of PCV3a and PCV3b: The tertiary structure models of PCV3a and PCV3b ORF2 protein were built using the I-TASSER online tool [60] (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu) based on the structure of PCV2. PCV3a (Strain: KX778720 PCV3-US/MO2015) and PCV3b (Strain:MF589105 PCV3/CN/Guangdong-SG1/2016) sequences www.advancedscience.com were used for the comparative analysis of epitopes and viral structure. The viral surface and structure were depicted in PyMOL (v1.5.0.4). [61] The epitopes of the PCV3 cap protein were predicted using the online server: (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) (epitope threshold set up at 0.5).

Selection Analysis: The detection of selection on the complete coding sequences of PCV3 was performed using DATAMONKEY (http://www. datamonkey.org/). The methods used to investigate positive codon sites included FEL, SLAC, FUBAR, MEME, [62] [63] [64] the branch site REL and the GA-branch site models were chosen to determine the selection pressure on the individual branches. [65, 66] Methods with p < 0.1 in SLAC, p < 0.05 in FEL and MEME and the posterior probability >0.9 in FUBAR, were considered to be more conservative positive selection pressure.

viruses Reliable and Standardized Animal Models to Study the Pathogenesis of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg Viruses in Ruminant Natural Host Species with Special Emphasis on Placental Crossing,"Starting in 2006, bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV8) was responsible for a major epizootic in Western and Northern Europe. The magnitude and spread of the disease were surprisingly high and the control of BTV improved significantly with the marketing of BTV8 inactivated vaccines in 2008. During late summer of 2011, a first cluster of reduced milk yield, fever, and diarrhoea was reported in the Netherlands. Congenital malformations appeared in March 2012 and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified, becoming one of the very few orthobunyaviruses distributed in Europe. At the start of both epizootics, little was known about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these viruses in the European context and most assumptions were extrapolated based on other related viruses and/or other regions of the World. Standardized and repeatable models potentially mimicking clinical signs observed in the field are required to study the pathogenesis of these infections, and to clarify their ability to cross the placental barrier. This review presents some of the latest experimental designs for infectious disease challenges with BTV or SBV. Infectious doses, routes of infection, inoculum preparation, and origin are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to the placental crossing associated with these two viruses.","Amongst pathogens, RNA viruses were a major source of emerging diseases during the last 30 years [1] . High mutation rate and in case of segmented genome, reassortment are responsible for genetic adaptability and variability of these viruses.

Two pathogens affecting cattle and sheep were responsible for major outbreaks in Mainland Europe in the past 15 years: Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). These outbreaks were singular in several ways: the diseases were previously either never reported in such northern locations (bluetongue virus) or recently discovered (Schmallenberg virus); their emergence still has 2.1. 1 

A high quality infectious inoculum reproducing the pathogenesis of diseases was essential to investigate vaccine efficacy requirements or certain specific aspects of the pathogenesis of recently discovered viruses [10, 11] . Facing an emerging disease with epizootic potential, reproduction of clinical disease under experimental conditions might be more reliable using infectious animal products such as blood or serum. Nevertheless, it appears that in the majority of the most recent experimental infections involving BTV or SBV, cell culture grown inocula were preferred for challenges (Table 1) . Reasons to use cell-passaged viruses can be summarized as follow:

(1) Original isolate or any strain of particular interest can be shipped almost anywhere in the world, leading to great improvement of standardization; (2) Viral amplification by cell-passages allows a high increase in viral titre, subsequently allowing to inoculate lower volumes; (3) Screening for contamination or other pathogens is easier in cell culture and eliminate some veterinary public health concerns about using ruminant blood to infect other ruminants; and (4) Virulence in cell culture can be easily standardized. Table 1 . Inocula characteristics used in the 10 most recent experimental infection studies on BTV and SBV (as searched on PubMed (July 2019) with keywords ""experimental infection bluetongue"" and ""experimental infection Schmallenberg""). Only articles about experimental infection involving at least one ruminant species among cattle, sheep or goats were retained. The number of infected animals only takes into account actually infected ones, excluding control animals. In several recent studies [14] clinical signs reported in BTV infected animals were of a lesser extent than those reported from the field [14, 17, 27, 28, [32] [33] [34] . As modified live vaccines gain their attenuation through serial cell passages, the first and most obvious hypothesis to explain the mild severity of bluetongue disease in the experiment is the use of culture grown virus. Moreover, passage history of the inocula used involved mostly embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), BHK-21 and VERO cells. It was reported that BTV grown on KC cells (derived from Culicoides sonorensis) could induce a greater clinical signs severity [35] probably because KC cells better mimic natural vector-borne infection compared to virus passaged on other cell lines [36] .

Like other families of RNA viruses, Peribunyaviridae-RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and orbiviruses VP1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are prone to produce errors during viral genome replication. In general, RNA virus replication is characterized by high mutation rates (10 −5 -10 −3 misincorporations per nucleotide copied), short generation times and high progeny yields [37] . In addition, segmented RNA viruses also generate genomic variations through recombination and reassortment [38] . Therefore, RNA viruses form populations of closely related viral variants that started from a single clone: the quasispecies [39, 40] .

With arthropod vectors, SBV and BTV typically undergo an alternate two-host 'life cycle' and are therefore suggested to be more stable and to evolve slower than vector-independent viruses [41] . Both steps may put selective pressures on these viruses, but it remains unknown whether sequence divergence is related to the mammalian or arthropod portion of life cycle. However, it has been demonstrated that despite the lack of changes in the consensus sequence, the passage of BTV in Culicoides cells induces an increase of the number of low-frequency variants as well as an increase in virulence [42] . This phenomenon has been hypothesized to explain the reduced viraemia and clinical picture seen in the re-emerging BTV8 in 2017 versus the 2007 strain [12] .

As a matter of fact, it was also reported that the inoculation of infectious material from field isolates rarely produce a clinical picture as severe as in natural infection [19] . An additional hypothesis would be that Culicoides saliva might act as a catalyser enhancing the ability of BTV to produce severe clinical signs. Indeed Culicoides saliva was demonstrated to contain a trypsin-like protease able to cleave VP2, leading to infectious subviral particles formation with enhanced infectivity [43] .

We demonstrated the suitability of BTV8 passaged a few times on cell culture to both reproduce clinical signs and RNA detection in calves [33] . Other authors concluded to the benefits of culture-grown viruses to be used in experimental challenges in ruminants [44] , as well. Despite converging results, policy of the OIE remains unchanged regarding recommended vaccine efficacy requirements, i.e., challenging vaccinated and unvaccinated sheep with a virus ""passaged only in ruminant animals and with no or limited ECE or cell culture passages"" [45] .

Results regarding SBV do not show that much consistency. In cattle, Wernike et al. reported a reduced viral replication of cell culture-grown SBV when compared to natural host-passaged inoculum [46] . By contrast, one year later the same team concluded to the suitability of both infectious serum and low passage cell culture material for SBV experimental challenges in sheep [47] . In addition to the passage history, the origin of the isolated virus seems to be of importance as virus originating from the central nervous system failed to reproduce RNAemia in inoculated animals [47] . Successive serial passages in cell-culture usually result in decreased virulence. However, regarding SBV, Varela et al. reported an increased pathogenicity in a SBV strain passaged 32 times in INF-incompetent sheep CPT-Tert cells, associated with a faster spread of the virus in the brain of suckling mice [48] . SBV was demonstrated to grow efficiently in several cell lines including sheep CPT-Tert, bovine BFAE, human 293T, dog MDCK, hamster BHK-21, BSR, KC, and VERO cells [48, 49] . Whereas serial passages in CPT-Tert led to the accumulation of a variety of mutations mostly in the M and S segments, the porcine cell line SK-6 proved to be highly susceptible and to allow the genetic stability of SBV throughout successive passages [50] . Therefore, depending on the cell line used to grow SBV, serial passages can lead to attenuation, increased virulence, or efficient propagation with a low frequency of nucleotide exchanges.

When it comes to arboviruses the choice of the route of inoculation can be driven by two main considerations:

(1) The need for a route that best mimics the behaviour of the vector in field conditions. Usually haematophagous arthropods are either telmophagous or solenophagous; depending on the vector species the route might be intradermal (ID), subcutaneous (SC), or intravenous (IV). In experimental infections the inoculated viral load and volume are usually higher than the ones inoculated through naturally occurring feeding given the size of the arthropods and the size of their mouthparts [51] . Another drawback already mentioned is the lack of vector saliva components, which can modify the structure and infectivity of Reoviridae and Peribunyaviridae viral particles [43, 52] . (2) The need for a route that will ensure the virus to reach the blood stream. Quite obviously this is the intravenous route. Since vector saliva components can enhance the infectivity of arboviruses there is a risk that the inoculation of the virus alone or at a distal site from the vector feeding site could result in a failed infection [53] . Therefore, the option to bypass the skin for reaching the bloodstream may be relevant.

Several authors including us [17] used mixed routes to overcome the respective disadvantages of each approach (Table 1 ; [34, 54] ). In a study of our group, we compared intranasal, intradermal and subcutaneous routes for experimental infections of ewes with SBV [28] . Intradermal is an interesting yet underused route: indeed most haematophagous arthropods do not pass the skin and their mouthparts only allow them to feed intradermally. Most of the cellular and fluid exchanges between the skin and the blood do occur in the dermis [55] . In addition, there are some evidences suggesting that intradermal inoculation can be more appropriate to reproduces many aspects of natural infection, including clinical disease, viral and immune responses [56] . The intradermic route was demonstrated to better mimic natural early stages of the infection, directly influencing the severity of the disease. BTV-induced immunosuppression is linked to the infection and disruption of follicular dendritic cells, which is mostly possible through intradermic inoculation [57] .

However, to perform an actual intradermal inoculation the volume to be injected has to be limited, the dermis being mostly composed of a dense network of collagen fibres. Therefore, it is required to multiply inoculation sites to reach desired total inoculum volume and infectious titre. To realize the inoculation itself, the most practical tools are Dermojet ® (Akra Dermojet) or special syringes for intradermal injections (used to perform bovine tuberculosis skin tests for example). These devices allow usually volumes between 0.1 and 0.4 mL, thus the need for multiple injections to reach the common 1-4 mL inoculation volume used in ruminant infectious challenges experiments (Table 1) . Moreover, with both systems the inoculum has to be transferred from its original vial to a small tank of the dermojet or to a special cartridge to be used with the intradermal syringe. This extra step increases the number of handlings, which should be limited especially in the case of BSL3 pathogens.

We investigated the intranasal route to test whether or not a potential direct SBV contamination between sheep could be achieved [28] . Regarding BTV several authors reported unexpected and inconclusive direct horizontal transmission with different serotypes (BTV8, BTV1, and BTV26 at least) [58] [59] [60] [61] .

Several authors reported a direct link between the inoculated viral doses and the onset of clinical signs and viraemia, i.e., the higher the dose the sooner the clinical signs and viral RNA detection [62] [63] [64] . In another study, we evaluated four 10-fold dilutions of a SBV infectious serum inoculum in ewes [30] . The undiluted original inoculum had a titre of 2 × 10 3 TCID 50 /mL. It appears there is a critical dose to be inoculated for reproducing field-like virological and immunological parameters, and once this threshold is reached, there is no dose-dependent effect anymore. In the successfully infected animals, no statistical differences between the different inoculation doses were found in the duration or quantity of viral RNA circulating in blood, nor in the amount of viral RNA present in virus positive lymphoid organs. Likewise Di Gialleonardo et al. compared three groups of cattle inoculated with 100-fold dilutions of BTV8; no significant differences in viraemia kinetics could be found [65] .

Inoculation by the bite of Culicoides was reported to be more efficient than intradermal inoculation, especially by delaying the early immune response of the host despite a generally lower inoculated viral dose when compared to needle inoculation [66] . Several mechanisms were hypothesized to explain this apparently enhanced infectivity in Culicoides transmitted BTV:

(1) The Culicoides saliva contains proteases able to cleave VP2, leading to the formation of infectious subviral particles (ISVP) displaying higher infectivity in KC cells and Culicoides [43] ; (2) The ratio of infectious BTV particles versus defective virions produced within Culicoides might be higher when compared with cell culture grown BTV [66] ; and (3) Pharmacological agents contained in Culicoides saliva might affect the host's immune response by anti-proliferative effects on leucocytes [67] or a reduced INF alpha/beta expression, as demonstrated with vesicular stomatitis virus and mosquito saliva [68] .

Nonetheless, the use of Culicoides to perform experimental challenges remains highly limited by practical constraints: to date besides C. nubeculosus, C. riethi, and C. sonorensis no other Culicoides species were successfully establish as lab-adapted colonies [69, 70] , the alternative being insects caught in the wild. In addition, prior to the infectious challenge on the ruminant host, the infection of Culicoides is particularly tricky given the size of the insect and the exact amount of virus delivered to each ruminant cannot be known.

Altogether, the subcutaneous route seems to represent the best compromise for BTV and SBV. The dose itself has to be sufficient but there is no gain in using massive viral load.

Bluetongue disease history is scarred with incidents of contamination of biological samples. In 1992, modified live vaccines against canine distemper, canine adenovirus type 2, canine parainfluenza, and canine parvovirus, reconstituted with a killed canine coronavirus vaccine, led to abortions in several bitches. A virus could be isolated and was eventually identified as BTV serotype 11 [71, 72] . More recently, a case of BTV11 contamination was reported by ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail, Maison-Alfort, France), in the context of an experimental infection of goats with BTV8. It appeared to be very closely related to the BTV11 isolated in Belgium [73] . We discussed a BTV15 contamination in a recent study [17] . This particular inoculum has been previously involved in two other experimental infections. Eschbaumer et al. used BTV1 culture supernatant that was then passaged once on VERO cells before being injected in calves and sheep [74] . That inoculum has been subsequently used by Dal Pozzo et al. [34] , with the exact same outcome, namely discovery of the BTV15 contamination. BTV inoculums were not only contaminated with BTV heterologous serotypes: Rasmussen et al. reported the use of a BTV2 inoculum contaminated with Border Disease Virus in sheep [75] .

So far, literature does not report experimental infections with a SBV inoculum that was contaminated by another virus belonging to the same or a different family. Broadly speaking contamination routes are most likely related to i) laboratory contamination during sample preparation or ii) natural multiple infection of the original donor animal [76] . Given the potential dramatic consequences of such contamination incidents, inocula should be tested for major pathogens affecting the host species used in challenge experiments but also for a set of BTV serotypes considered to be the most at risk. Despite the transient circulation of BTV6 [77] , BTV11 [76] , and BTV14 [78] of vaccine origin in Europe, the BTV11 contamination here above mentioned happened to be similar to BTV11 reference strain. Hence, the contamination of the inoculum is far from being necessarily related to an ongoing viral circulation even though it might remain silent because of the lack of clinical consequences. Thus, to rule out any potential BTV contamination all known BTV serotypes should be tested for. Such a recommendation would inevitably increase the constraints and costs of quality control of inocula prior to their use in experimental infections. Extensive screening could however be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Vertical transmission from pregnant dams to their offspring is one of the major consequences for both SBV and BTV. Many pathogens are able of crossing the placenta to cause foetal injury. Most maternal virus infections are not transmitted to the foetus. However, certain viruses are able of crossing the placental barrier possibly causing developmental defects (teratogenesis). The teratogenesis is the production of a permanent abnormality in structure or function, restriction of growth, or death of the embryo or foetus [79] . The outcome of in utero infection depends on the susceptibility of the foetus to the infecting virus, which in turn, is a reflection of the gestational age of the foetus at exposure as well as the virulence characteristics of the infecting virus [80] . Nervous tissues are important targets for both BTV and SBV: usually the younger the foetus, the more severe the lesions [81, 82] .

To colonize the foetus viruses need a way in. Therefore, it is considered that SBV in utero infection can only occur once the first placentomes were established, around day 30 of pregnancy in cattle and slightly earlier in sheep [83] [84] [85] . At implantation, several changes occur: the papillae in the uterine glands immobilize the conceptus and it starts to elongate (cattle: 15 days post coitum (dpc); sheep: 13-16 dpc). Subsequently the cells of the trophectoderm and the uterine epithelium get interdigitated and binucleate cells start to be seen. Then binucleate cells start to differentiate and to migrate (cattle: 20-22 dpc; sheep: 16-18 dpc). Foetal villi develop in the caruncular areas starting at 24-26 dpc in small ruminants and 28-30 dpc in cattle, thus defining the end of the implantation and the start of the placental development [86] . Table 2 summarizes some of the essential events in the course of the prenatal development in cattle and sheep. In a recent study, we decided to infect with BTV8 vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant heifers at 120 days of pregnancy (BTV pregnant heifers study [32] ). We also challenged pregnant ewes with SBV at 45 and 60 days of pregnancy (SBV pregnant ewes study [27] ). Thus, for both viruses the experimental infection took place within the critical timeframe, between 30 and 150 days for cattle and between 30 and 70 days of pregnancy for sheep (Figure 1, [85] ). Moreover, in experimental conditions the most frequent BTV transplacental infection was reported to occur at mid-term gestation, around 70 days of pregnancy in sheep [58, 59] .

The prenatal period can be divided into four main periods: i) fertilization; ii) blastogenesis; iii) embryogenesis; and iv) foetogenesis [94] . The embryo develops tissues and organ structures from the three original germ layers (ecto-, meso-, and endoderm). Once the organs are differentiated the embryo becomes a foetus [95] . The foetal phase is characterized by a fast growth of the conceptus. In cattle and sheep the foetogenesis starts around 45 and 38 dpc, respectively [90] . Thus, the critical timeframe for BTV and SBV infection overlaps the end of the embryo stage and the beginning of the foetal stage. Moreover, although in ruminants gamma globulins are unable to go through the placental barrier from the mother to the foetus it is admitted that cow and sheep foetuses become sequentially and increasingly immunocompetent to a larger variety of antigens throughout the pregnancy [96, 97] . The critical timeframe for BTV and SBV infection also spans over the course of several important events during the immune system development ( Table 2 ). Although the sequence of antigens to be successively and progressively recognized by the foetal ruminant through pregnancy seems to be quite conserved between individuals, these antigens can be recognized starting with a difference of a few days between individuals [98] . This individual variability could explain the findings by De Clercq et al. (2008) , who reported all possible combinations of serological status/RTqPCR results in dam/calf pairs in a context of high BTV8 suspicion along with results which were interpreted as apparent immunotolerance [99] . Likewise, malformed calves and lambs were reported to be SBV viropositive or vironegative with or without SBV antibodies, suggesting the possibility of an in utero clearance of the virus. Moreover, most of the malformed calves that were negative in both SBV antibodies and RTqPCR were born from seropositive mothers [100] .

In our studies, none of these evocative lesions was reported either in the BTV pregnant heifers study or in the SBV pregnant ewes study [27, 32] .

Following the infection of pregnant dams we reported the reddening of the muzzle and haemorrhages in the wall of the pulmonary artery in calves born from non-vaccinated mothers. Haemorrhages of the pulmonary artery is a BTV typical yet not pathognomonic lesion [101] . These findings were associated with the absence of any anti-BTV antibodies prior to the colostrum intake [32] . Melzi et al. reported the early infection and destruction of follicular dendritic cells following BTV infection. Consequently, antibody production is notably impaired and could be an element explaining the lack of BTV antibody detection in those calves [57] . This result provides an interesting perspective to the many petechial haemorrhages we observed on lymph nodes in several of our own experimental infections [14, 17, 32, 33] .

Following the infection of pregnant ewes with SBV, out of the 22 born-alive lambs none had any anti-SBV neutralizing antibodies prior to colostrum intake [27] .

In both these experiments, timing of inoculation was optimal to achieve transplacental infection of the foetus with regard to data available from the literature yet no malformations could be seen. No antibodies against the virus used to infect the mothers could be detected as well. These striking results might even question the success of the infection, notwithstanding the positive RNA detection in the mothers. In our BTV pregnant heifers study, the report of similar lesions and serology results in another experiment on goats [102] , and in our SBV pregnant ewes study the detection of SBV nucleic acids in organs of several lambs and many extraembryonic structures provided support to an actual transplacental infection. In addition, in another study [103] we managed to isolate SBV from foetal envelopes in the animals from the SBV pregnant ewes study at birth, thus 90 and 105 days post infection.

The very low ratio of precolostral seroconversion in immunocompetent foetuses was also reported following the infection of pregnant cattle with SBV [104] .

Transplacental transmission of BTV8 based on field data was reported to range from 16% [105, 106] to 35% [107, 108] . In experimental infections, passage of BTV8 from the mother to the foetus could be demonstrated in 43% of infected ewes whereas BTV1 could be detected in up to 67% of the foetus [59] . The highest susceptibility could be observed around 35-42 days of pregnancy in sheep [109] and infections after day 75 were reported to result in much lighter consequences [110] . Placental crossing, depending on the gestational stage, the BTV serotype and the inoculated dose, was reported to cause congenital defect in up to 40% of the offspring of infected ewes [111] . Other authors observed a BTV8 vertical transmission rate of 33% in goats infected at 61 days of pregnancy [112] .

During the BTV epizootic of 2007-2008, Darpel et al., estimated transplacental infection rate of 33%, which is consistent with the latter result [107] .

The lesions potentially presented by the calves affected in utero by SBV could be distinguished according to two entities: a hydrocephaly/hydranencephaly syndrome and a torticollis/arthrogryposis syndrome. By analogy with Akabane virus the infection during the first 6 months seems to be critical: an infection of the foetus between 76 and 104 days usually gives rise to hydranencephaly/porencephaly type lesions, and from 103 to 174 it is predominantly arthrogryposis [113] . The latest lesions have been observed for infection at 249 days of gestation and it appears that foetuses less than two months old (after conception) could be protected from in utero infection [113] . In contrast to SBV torticollis was hardly seen after a BTV8 in utero infection during the BTV epidemic in 2006-2009 but was more dominated by hydranencephaly in sheep [114] .

Also in contrast to SBV, BTV in utero infection is in the vast majority of cases associated to BTV lab adapted strains (i.e., passaged on cell culture like modified live vaccine strains) or more recently with the European BTV8 wild type virus. By the end of the 20th century, at least five BTV serotypes of modified live vaccine origin (BTV4, BTV10, BTV11, BTV13, BTV17) were reported to be able to cross the placental barrier and possibly causing teratogenic effects [115] [116] [117] [118] . In utero infection caused by wild-type strains was considered uncommon [119] yet documented [120] .

SBV vertical transmission seems to be lower when compared to BTV, especially in cattle [121] . The rate of malformations caused by SBV was reported to be about 0.5% in cattle [122] although the rate of intrauterine infection-based on serological results of the calves prior to colostrum intake-was reported to be up to 28% [83] . Other authors documented field data about congenital malformations affecting 3% of the calves but 8-10% of the lambs in farms at the beginning of the SBV epizootic [123, 124] . In Belgium based on a survey targeting farmers we also found an estimated 10% of malformed sheep in SBV positive flocks [125] . Table 3 summarizes the most common in utero malformations and nervous lesions induced by some of the most common viruses inducing BTV and SBV-like lesions in ruminants. [27, 32, 81, 85, 104, 127, 128] . In utero potential BTV (blue shades) and SBV induced defects (green shades) following infection of the pregnant dams along the whole gestation time for cattle and small ruminants. Time is expressed as a fraction of the total gestational time. A more detailed timeline is available as supplementary file. [27, 32, 81, 85, 104, 127, 128] .

Time is expressed as a fraction of the total gestational time. A more detailed timeline is available as supplementary file.

Embryonic losses represent a key factor affecting ruminant production systems. In cattle, as well as in sheep, most of the spontaneous embryo mortalities occur in the early embryonic life, namely before 16-18 dpc [129, 130] . In cattle early embryonic losses under normal conditions were reported to range from 20 to 44% whereas in sheep in ranges from 12 to 30%, with a clear increase of embryo deaths with the ovulation rate [129, 131] . The impact of both BTV and SBV on reproductive parameters other than teratogenesis is well documented. BTV8 was reported to increase the 56-days-return to service rate and the number of AI (Artificial Insemination) required to achieve pregnancy [132, 133] . During the SBV epizootic the number of AI to get cattle pregnant was slightly yet significantly increased regardless of whether or not they were part of a herd reporting malformations indicative of an actual infection [134] .

Although SBV and especially BTV had a tremendous economic impact on livestock industry, it is worthwhile highlighting the relative poor efficiency of the placental crossing and more specifically the overall low rate of congenital deformities induced by those viruses. However, congenital malformations underestimate the actual rates of BTV and SBV transplacental infections [128] .

The number of ruminants used in experimental infections is chosen based on welfare and statistical concerns but also quite unfortunately on economic and practical grounds [8] . We performed our experimental infections with BTV in the BSL3 facilities of Sciensano (Ukkel, Belgium) and with SBV in BSL2+/BSL3 facilities depending the phase of the experiment. Indeed, the Belgian Service of Biosafety and Biotechnology as well as the Belgian law classify BTV as a class 3 pathogen whereas there is no recommendation for SBV. Our biosafety measures for SBV were based on the analogy with AKAV, also classified as a class 3 pathogen [135] . Domestic ruminants being herd animals, need to be housed in groups or at least not individually. Euthanasia methods have to be the most humane as possible and clear end points have to be defined. Given the scarcity of clinical signs caused by BTV and SBV in the field and the individual variations in the response to the infection the number of animals to be included has to be chosen very carefully to comply with the Reduction objective (Three Rs concept) but has to be sufficient to limit the risk of not being able to provide useful data in the context of the ongoing scientific investigation. This is particularly difficult for experimental infection of pregnant ruminants with low malformation rates following transplacental transmission.

The most objective parameter to assess a vaccine efficacy against a virus and especially a RNA vector-borne virus is the evaluation of the viral RNA detection by RTqPCR in the host target [44] . BTV and SBV virulence was demonstrated to vary depending on the ruminant host whether it is cattle, sheep or goat. In addition, pregnancy length differs between cattle and small ruminants while the placentation and the development of the foetal envelopes present slight differences [136] . Consequently, to study any of the specific aspects related to a ruminant species there are no other animal models or any alternative able to mimic the natural situation in a proper way [8] .

The results presented in our latest studies provide new insights in viruses that spread through Europe causing severe losses in livestock industry. In addition, these aspects open new perspectives to expand the knowledge on emerging vector-borne viruses targeting ruminants. More specifically, according to our experiments, the subcutaneous route with an inoculum passaged a limited number of times on cell culture seems to represent the best compromise between a high probability to reproduce an infection similar to what happens in the field and logistics concerning the preparation/storage/management of the inoculum. To prevent the loss of viral variability and limit the risks of attenuation, isolation of BTV could be done on KC cells [35] , whereas SBV could benefit from an isolation on the highly susceptible SK-6 cell line [50] . Screening for concomitant pathogens should be considered on a case by case basis, if required. The dose should be chosen based on literature data yet no advantage is provided by inoculating a massive viral load.

Since some data from other authors suggest a better reproduction of the diseases with intradermal inoculation, it could be further investigated, especially if more user-friendly devices would be available.

A major breakthrough would be the successful adaptation of a colony of Palearctic BTV and SBV vector Culicoides species (C. obsoletus/scoticus, pulicaris) to laboratory conditions and subsequent use in infectious challenges. Vector-borne transmission of BTV implies the puncture of the skin at some point. There is growing evidence that under certain circumstances additional routes of transmission can be observed: a goat was reported to be infected by BTV2 without direct contact [75] . The recently discovered BTV26 also displayed the ability to infect goats through direct contact [61] . In other experimental infections control ewes were found positive with BTV1 and BTV8 [58, 59] . The study of the virus factors affecting this modified/underreported transmission feature should allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease.

In conclusion, targeting ruminant host species in experimental infections especially with BSL3 Culicoides borne pathogens is very expensive, time consuming, subject to stringent animal welfare constraints and critical sample size analysis to meet optimal statistical requirements. However, ruminant model remains unavoidable to assess the disease impact and to study the pathogenesis of emerging vector-borne viruses.

Genomic organization and adaptive evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals,"Immunoglobulins are important elements of the adaptive immune system that bind to an immense variety of microbial antigens to neutralize infectivity and specify effector functions. In the present study, the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (IGHC) genes from marine mammals were identified and compared with those of their terrestrial relatives to explore their genomic organization and evolutionary characteristics. The genomic organization of marine mammal IGHC genes was shown to be conservative with other eutherian mammals. Stronger signals of positive selection on IGHC were revealed in terrestrial mammals than that in marine mammals with the branch-site model, displaying different selective pressure, which might suggest their divergent adaptations to contrasted environments.","Immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoprotein molecules that function as antibodies and are only expressed in jawed vertebrates (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Typically, Igs compose two identical heavy (IgH) and two identical light chains (IgL). Both heavy and light chains can be divided into two regions, i.e., the constant region and the variable region, based on the variability of amino acid sequences. In general, the variable region recognizes antigens, whereas the constant region specifies critical effector or signaling functions, such as phagocytosis, binding Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptors and activation of complement (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . The classification of Igs is based on their heavy chain constant (IGHC) genes (Bengtén et al., 2000) . To date, several IgH isotypes, including IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA, have been identified in multiple vertebrates, and they are encoded by the IGHM, IGHD, IGHG, IGHE and IGHA genes respectively (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . Both IgM and IgD have been reported to be the most ancient IgH isotypes among jawed vertebrates, with IgM very conserved but IgD showing a high degree of structural and (presumably) functional diversity and even being lost in some species over evolutionary time (Sun et al., 2011; Ohta and Flajnik, 2006) . IgG and IgE are both exclusively present in mammals (Bengtén et al., 2000; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) , the former being the predominant serum antibody and binding receptors on phagocytic cells and the latter predominantly functioning in immunity against parasites (Maizels, 2005) . Additionally, IgA was found in reptiles first, with similar functions in all animals (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Participating in mucosal immunity, IgA coats pathogens to prevent proliferation and defend against local infection (Macpherson et al., 2008) .

Extant marine mammals descended from terrestrial ancestors that re-entered in the aquatic environment at different times (Uhen, 2010) . There are five main groups of extant marine mammals: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises and whales), Sirenia (manatees, dugongs), Pinnipedia (walruses, sea lions and seals), polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) (Uhen, 2007) . Cetacea and Sirenia are the only known completely aquatic mammals, and they appeared to return to the aquatic environment at approximately the same time, i.e. ∼50 Mya (million years ago) (Uhen, 2010; Thewissen et al., 2007) . In contrast, semi-aquatic pinnipeds, with a close relationship to Musteloidea, later transferred to water environment at ∼28 Mya (Uhen, 2010; Flynn et al., 2005) . Despite the independent evolutionary origins of these marine mammals groups, they have developed a series of specializations for aquatic lifestyles, such as loss of hair, thickened blubber, derivation of echolocation, and so on (Uhen, 2007) .

During their transition from terrestrial environment to the sea, marine mammals must have faced dramatic changes in pathogens. Recent studies have shown that cetacean TLR4 and MHC were subjected to adaptive evolution, particularly in the lineages with dramatic habitat transition (e.g. the lineage leading to hippo + whale representing the early stage of aquatic adaptation) or rapid radiation lineages such as extant dolphins (Shen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016) . However, the evolution of Ig in the aquatic adaptation of marine mammals remains poorly explored, except for a few reports about the cloning and sequencing of IGHC genes in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (Mancia et al., 2006 (Mancia et al., , 2007 Lundqvist et al., 2002) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) (Breaux et al., 2017) and the identification of IgM, IgG and IgA and lineage-specific IGHG gene duplication in some cetaceans (Mancia et al., 2006) , and so on. Therefore, in the present study, we first retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten representative marine mammals. The genomic organization of IGHC cluster was identified and positive selection on the marine mammals was detected to address whether they experienced adaptive evolution in response to aquatic environments.

We first downloaded the IGHC genes of 13 terrestrial mammals, including cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), human (Homo sapiens), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), rat (Rattus norvegicus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensemble databases and the International ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT). The accession numbers of these sequences are compiled in Supplemental  Table 1 . Then we used IGHC sequences of these terrestrial relatives as a query to search for the orthologous genes from 10 marine mammal genomes with TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches, including bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), killer whale (Orcinus orca), Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocuena asiaeorientalis), baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), sperm whale (Physeter catodon), minke whale (Balaena acutorostrata), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). In addition, IGHC genes were also scanned from the genomes of three additional terrestrial mammals, i.e., hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), European shrew (Sorex araneus), and elephant (Loxodonta africana). The detailed information about the genome assemblies used in this study is given in Table 1 . Finally, we checked whether the newly identified putative IGHC genes were their best hit by a blast search against the non-redundant database from GenBank. The newly identified IGHC genes were further separated into intact genes, partial genes and pseudogenes based on the amino acid alignment and blast results. The genomic coordinates of the newly identified IGHC genes are listed in Supplemental Table 2 .

To confirm that the regions of alignment had sufficient confidence to test for positive selection and determine phylogenetic relationships, the unaligned multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of IGHC genes translated to amino-acid sequences and further back-translated into the corresponding codon were submitted to GUIDANCE (Penn et al., 2010a, b) to obtain alignment confidence scores. GUIDANCE used a PRANK alignment program (version 140,110) and returned a colored MSA that allowed to delimit aligned regions ambiguously. Then the columns with confidence scores lower than the threshold were excluded from further analyses.

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) in MrBayes 3.2.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and Maximum likelihood (ML) in RAxML 8.0.26 (Stamatakis, 2006) . The best-fit evolutionary model for each dataset was chosen by MrModeltest 2.3 (Nylander, 2004) with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Bayesian inference analysis was run for 10 6 generations with one cold and three heated Markov chains to ensure the analysis remaining in global rather than local optima and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The first 1000 trees were discarded as the ""burn-in"". Because the samples from the beginning of the chain are unreliable. For ML analysis, the maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed with 1000 bootstrap replications.

The rate of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitution (d N /d S or omega, ω) measures the direction and intensity of natural selection, with ω = 1, ω > 1 and ω < 1 indicating neutral evolution, positive and purifying selection, respectively. To detect the impact of natural selection on IGHC genes, we performed a number of statistical tests based on calculating the ω values using the CODEML program implemented in PAML 4.7 package (Yang, 2007) . The selection analyses using the gene tree reconstructed by BI and ML methods generated nearly the same results as those from the well-supported species phylogeny (Perelman et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011a) ; thus, only the latter analysis is shown here.

To detect positively selected sites on IGHC genes, we first performed the site specific models, i.e., M8a (nearly neutral, beta distribution: 0 < ω 0 < 1 and ω 1 = 1) versus M8 (positive selection, beta distribution: 0 < ω 0 < 1 and ω 1 > 1), as implemented in CODEML program. In addition, positively selected sites were identified using Datamonkey, which incorporated the rate of synonymous substitution, whereas the d S was fixed in PAML. Three ML methods, i.e. the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effect likelihood (FEL), and random-effect likelihood (REL) implemented in the Datamonkey website (Pond and Frost, 2005a) , were used to infer the positively selected sites with default settings and significance levels of 0.1, 0.1, and 50, respectively. Although SLAC, a conservative method, is suitable for large data sets, it usually underestimates the substitution rate. FEL method seems to capture the pattern of rate variation better than SLAC and REL, but it tends to be less conservative than SLAC to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size. REL approach is more powerful than SLAC and FEL, but it has the higher rates of false positives for small data sets (Pond and Frost, 2005a,b) . These three predictions were conducted to estimating ω value of each site.

To further detect whether the possibility of positive selection was limited on specific lineages, we compared the free-ratio model, which estimated a separate ω ratio for each lineage, with the one-ratio model that estimated a same ω ratio for all lineages in the tree (Yang, 1998) . In addition, the branch-site model were conducted to detect evidence of positive selection on individual codon along a specific lineage (Zhang et al., 2005) . In branch-site model, we compared Ma (positive selection, 0 < ω 0 < 1, ω 1 = 1 and ω 2 ≥ 1) with Ma0 (neutral selection, 0 < ω 0 < 1, ω 1 = 1 and ω 2 = 1) to detect positive selection. The significance of the differences between two nested models was tested using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) statistic (-2[LogLikelihood1-LogLike-lihood2]) with a chi-square distribution. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach implemented in the CODEML was used to test the posterior probabilities (PPs) of positively selected sites, where sites with PPs > 0.90 were considered as candidates undergoing positive selection. Finally, to support the PAML results, we employed a complementary protein-level approach implemented in TreeSAAP (Woolley et al., 2003) that detected the significant changes in amino acid physicochemical properties.

In the present study, we retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten marine mammals (including seven cetaceans, one manatee and two pinnipeds) and compared them with those of terrestrial relatives to provide insights into the evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals. We found that the genomic regions containing an IGHC cluster are conservative with special flanking sequences, i.e., the TMEM121 and IGH diversity gene cluster (Eguchi-Ogawa et al., 2012) , which helped us obtain the complete IGHC genes in mammalian genomes. A total of 182 IGHC genes were identified in the 26 mammals in our study (Fig. 1) , including 79 sequences that were newly identified in 13 species. For the 10 marine mammals, a total of 59 sequences were identified in this study.

To define the orthologous relationships among IGHC genes, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees for each gene, as well as a phylogenetic tree incorporating all members of IGHC genes from 26 mammals using two different methods (BI and ML). Similar tree topologies were inferred (Fig. 2, Supplemental Figs. 1-11) . The phylogenetic relationship showed that the IGHC genes of marine mammals could be clustered well with those of their terrestrial relatives, suggesting that marine mammals possess the typical isotype repertoire as other eutherian mammals. Similar to other mammals, marine mammals were found to contain a single IGHM, IGHD, IGHE, and IGHA genes, and several IGHG genes based on the phylogenetic reconstruction. The order of IGHC genes in the IgH locus of marine mammals was determined to be 5′-IGHM-IGHD-IGHG-IGHE-IGHA-3′, which is in agreement with their terrestrial relatives (Supplemental Fig. 12) . Furthermore, we found that the first domain (CH1) of IGHM and the CH1 of IGHD of cetaceans shared nearly identical sequences, as shown in artiodactylas (Zhao et al., 2002) (Supplemental Fig. 13 ). The genomic organization of marine mammal IGHC genes is similar to that of other species examined, which suggested a constraint acting on their genomic arrangement and the conserved genomic organization of the IGHC genes.

The expansion of the IgG subclass is primarily a feature of mammals (Hsu et al., 2006) . The IgG-like Igs of chicken and lizard showed no subclass diversification (Butler et al., 2011) . The gene duplication of IGHG genes is believed to have occurred most recently, and it belongs to a lineage-specific event (Wagner et al., 2002) . In the present study, we found that there are usually two or four IGHG genes in marine mammals (Fig. 1) . Like other mammals, the IGHG gene in marine mammals comprises three CH domains and a hinge segment. Furthermore, they have close sequence similarities to the IGHG genes in their terrestrial relatives. Based on the phylogenetic tree, it was found that IGHG genes within one species clustered together rather than with those of other species (Fig. 2) . However, the IGHG genes of five species grouped together with their true orthologues in closely related species, including bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, Yangtze finless porpoise, Weddell seal and Pacific walrus, likely due to the species of Delphinidae (e.g., dolphin, killer whale) rapidly diverging during a very narrow time frame of ∼3 million years (Zhou et al., 2011b) from the last common ancestral IGHG genes. These observations provided evidence to support the view that species-specific duplication of IGHG genes occurred during the evolution of mammalian species (Wagner et al., 2002) . Overall, the presence of IgG subclasses and species-specific duplication of IGHG genes in marine mammals further confirmed the finding that IGHC genes of marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives.

The number of IGHC genes has been noted to vary among different mammals. For example, 2 IGHA genes were present in humans and platypuses (Mage et al., 2006) , whereas 13 IGHA genes were found in rabbits (Mccallum et al., 2004) . For IGHG genes, seven copies were found in horses (Wagner et al., 2004) , five in humans (Takahashi et al., 1982) , and only one in rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) and opossum . No IGHG gene was detected in the bowhead whale and little brown bat (Fig. 1) , which may due to the bad genomic assembly of both species considering that IgG subclasses have been identified in other whales (Mancia et al., 2006) and partial sequence encoding of IgG in little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) was recovered by PCR (Butler et al., 2011) . We also failed to retrieve IGHD genes from the genomes of sperm whale, hedgehog, European shrew, little brown bat, black flying fox and elephant despite considerable efforts (Fig. 1) . One possible explanation is the poor genome quality, and the an alternative explanation is that the IGHD gene might have really been lost in evolution, similar to the situation in opossums ) and rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) . Further investigations to recover IGHD transcript by PCR will be needed in the future. Despite necessary further verification of IGHC genes in some species(e.g. with transcript evidence), changes in the copy number of IGHC genes among different mammalian lineages might reflect the rapid evolution of Ig genes (Hsu et al., 2006) , corresponding to the marked variability found in the pathogens in different environments.

To detect the possible roles of positive selection during the evolution of IGHC genes in mammalian lineages, evolutionary analyses were conducted using a series of selection models implemented in the CODEML program and DataMonkey website. Because of the absence of intact IGHD genes in many mammals and the species-specific duplication of IGHG genes, only datasets of the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were used to test the selection. Site model analysis of all mammals revealed that the models incorporating positive selection (M8) fit the data significantly better than the neutral model (M8a) for both the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas no evidence of positive selection was identified at the IGHE genes (Table 2) . Specially, M8 model detected nine positively selective sites at the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas a total of 39 codons from the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were also found to be under positive selection using the FEL, REL, and SLAC methods implemented in Datamonkey. Eleven codons from three genes (5 in IGHM, 2 in IGHE, 4 in IGHA) were predicted to be robust sites under positive selection identified by at least two ML methods. Furthermore, TreeSAAP analysis showed that these 11 positively selected sites have undergone radical changes in their physicochemical properties (Table 3) , and this may be regarded as another evidence to support significant positive selection. Then, we marked the putatively selected sites in the alignment and found that 36.4% (4/11) of these sites were located in, or close to, the functionally important regions of IGHC genes (Supplemental Fig. 14) . This result suggested that positive selection on mammals may be the major driving force for the evolution of IGHC genes to adapt to environmental pathogens. Besides, for expanded subclasses, such as the 13 IGHA genes of rabbit and multiple copies of IGHG gene in mammals, we tested whether this species-specific expansion has been influenced by positive selection. The site model analysis (M8 vs. M8a, M1a vs. M2a implemented in PAML) showed that the IGHA genes of rabbits were under positive selection with similar positively selected sites (Supplemental Table 3 ). The branch-site model was used to examine whether some branches leading to gene duplication of IGHG genes (branch a-o) have been positively selected. The results showed that signals of positive selection were detected in branches a (Delphinoidea), c (Physeter catodon), e (Bos taurus), f (Sus scrofa), g (Equus caballus), and h (Macaca mulatta) (Supplemental Table 4 , Supplemental Fig. 15 ). Overall, pervasive positive selection was detected on IGHC genes of mammals.

As is well known, many physicochemical properties, such as temperature, pressure, illumination and osmotic pressure, are different between water and land environments, possibly causing the difference in the diversity and abundance of pathogens. To date, there has been no deterministic conclusion on whether the pathogenic microbes in marine environment or in terrestrial environment are more diverse. Some early studies have supported weaker pathogenic pressure in the water environment (Zhang et al., 2016; Trowsdale et al., 1989; Slade, 1992) , while several recent studies have examined the microbiome of marine mammals, suggesting that although the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in marine mammals is distinct from those of terrestrial mammals, its diversity is not lower than that of terrestrial mammals (Bik et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2015) .

To further test whether marine and terrestrial mammals were subjected to different pathogenic pressures during their evolution, we used the branch model in our study. The LRTs showed that the free-ratio model fits better than one-ratio model for IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes, indicating heterogeneous selective pressures on different lineages. The ω values greater than 1 are limited to some branches in marine and terrestrial mammals, including the terminal branch of minke whale, the last common ancestral (LCA) branch of baleen whales, the LCA branch of Glires, and the LCA branch of Euarchontoglires at IGHA gene; the terminal branch of bowhead whale, and the LCA branch of Eulipotyphla at IGHE genes; the LCA branch of Laurasiatheria at IGHM gene (Fig. 1) , suggesting similar selective pressures acting on IGHC genes in marine and terrestrial mammals. This result could provide evidence to support that the diversity and abundance of pathogens in water was comparable to that in land.

We also used more stringent branch-site model to predict positive selection acting on specific sites in each lineage. Almost all signs of positive selection were identified in terrestrial lineages (e.g., artiodactyla, perissodactyla, chiroptera, eulipotyphla, primates, Glires, Fig. 1 . Positive selection at IGHC genes across the mammal phylogeny and the presence/absence patterns of mammal IGHC genes. A widely accepted phylogeny of mammals was used for selective pressure analysis in the free ratio model and the branch-site model. The branches indicated by vertical lines or circles show evidence of undergoing positive selection. The red font indicates marine mammals; black font indicates terrestrial mammals. The IGHC genes of corresponding species were listed in the right part of Fig. 1 . Each circle represents a gene member; circles represent a complete gene sequence; semicircles indicate a partial gene sequence; red cross means no sequences found by TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches; black cross means the gene really lost; the species highlighted with a black line mean a pseudogene. Table 4 ). By contrast, for marine mammal lineages, only the terminal branch of Florida manatee was subjected to positive selection (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 4 ). This result supported that pathogenic pressure was weaker in aquatic environment than in terrestrial environment. Moreover, recent studies showed a very low number of variable genes that directly binds to antigens in marine mammals, which also supported this conclusion (Olivieri et al., 2014) . But further study on the variable region will be needed, providing insights to understand whether the difference in selective pressure between marine and terrestrial mammals existed and whether such a difference could respond to the different pathogenic pressure between aquatic and land environments.

In the present study, IGHC genes were determined to have undergone positive selection in Chiroptera, which is now known as notorious reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic viruses, including Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) responsible for severe human and livestock disease outbreaks. However, they rarely display clinical symptoms (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang, 2009 ). The ability of bats to coexist with viruses presents an interesting immunological problem. Previous studies have founded that some immunoglobulin gene superfamilies underwent expansion in Brandt's bat (Seim et al., 2013) and that some positively selected genes were involved in the immune response (Zhang et al., 2013) . Thus, IGHC genes subject to positive selection in chiropterans may be related to the longterm coexistence of bats and viruses. Evidences for positive selection has also been detected in some domesticated mammals such as pig, horse and cattle. Approximately 10,000 years ago, the domestication of farm animals by selection for biological, agricultural and biomedical importance began, leading to animals that slowly adapted to local condition. Approximately 200 years ago, selection pressures on livestock increased with the rise of the concept of breeds (Taberlet et al., 2008) . It has been previously proposed that artificial selection indirectly drove for rapid adaptation of domestic animals and pathogen genes (Smith et al., 2012) . Therefore, we postulated that artificial selection resulted in the adaptive evolution observed in IGHC genes of domestic animals.

This study has provided the first characterization of IGHC genes in marine mammals and explored their potential molecular genetic basis in the secondary aquatic adaptation. Our analyses revealed that the IGHC genes in marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives. In addition, different levels of selection were detected between marine and terrestrial mammalian lineages with the branchsite model, suggesting a divergent adaptation to land and aquatic environments probably due to contrasting pathogenic pressures. Further investigation on the variable region of IgH genes is necessary to improve our understanding of the immune adaptation of marine mammals.

Animal virus ecology and evolution are shaped by the virus host-body,"12 The current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world, the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle. This virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission 16 dynamics and, with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of 17 the host environment. This study examines the transmission ecology of the world main 18 livestock viruses, 36 in total, belonging to eleven different families, and a mix of RNA, DNA 19 and retroviruses. Viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, based on 20 the shifting organ system involvement and associated infection-shedding-transmission 21 dynamics. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with the aim to contrast two main host 22 45 the virus. Two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge, respectively for generalist type, 46 outer-body and for specialist, inner-body viruses.","ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus equine husbandry, as well as to 23 create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retroviruses, also ranked in an outer-to inner-24 body fashion. Spearman correlation reveals the matches among these various virus traits, as 25 pertaining to the two host-ecologies, four infection-shedding-transmission related variables, 26 and the three virus genomes. The collective results reveal the outer-to inner-body shifts in 27 the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of the virus. Two 28 opposing virus evolution pathways emerge, respectively for generalist type, outer-body and 29 for specialist type, inner-body viruses. The ecological virus classification here presented is 30 broadly consistent with the current virus classification system and offers the advantage of 31 bringing substance and cohesion to the interrelationships among viruses and virus families.

Still, there is growing 34 awareness that viruses as biological replicators are subjected to ecological sorting and so 35 require a viable propagation strategy. In the current analysis I depart from the precept that 36 virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. I examine the transmission ecologies 37 of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a collection of pathogens well described in 38 terms of the organ system involvement, infection course, the extent of host damage, virus 39 shedding profile, and virus transmission modes. The viruses are on this basis ranked in an 40 outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with a 41 view to contrast two main host ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus 42 equine husbandry, as well as to create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retrovirus in 43 the study. The matches among these various virus traits serve to establish the outer-to 44 inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of Introduction 48 Increasingly, viruses are viewed in an ecological context, as living entities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Viruses, 49 like all biological replicators, form a continuum along the selfishness-cooperativity axis, from 50 the completely selfish to fully cooperative forms [6] . In a deeper sense, the history of life is a 51 story of parasite-host coevolution that includes both the incessant arms race and various 52 forms of cooperation [7] . 53 Organ systems and virus transmission success 54 The current paper approaches the evolution of viral replication and propagation strategies [11] . 80 The study 81 The study explores the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, 82 a collection of well described pathogens. Viruses are ranked in an outer-to inner-body 83 fashion, virtually, on the basis of the shifting organ system involvement, transmission 84 modes, and infection-shedding-transmission related variables. Next, this virus infiltration 85 ranking is disentangled to contrast the poultry plus pig to the ruminant plus equine viruses, 86 as well as to separately consider the RNA, DNA and retroviruses in the study, also ranked in 87 an outer-to inner-body fashion. 94 As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four 95 ecological variables were matched on the basis of Spearman correlation, see also S2 Fig reflects, respectively, acute, acute and persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the 589 score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and 590 above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number 591 of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, 592 three to ten, to over ten days.
