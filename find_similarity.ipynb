Denominators for testing and a mechanism for rapidly sharing that information, including demographics, to the extent possible.

    "- National guidance and guidelines about best practices to states (e.g., how states might leverage universities and private laboratories for testing purposes, communications to public health officials and the public).\n",

    "Rapid design and execution of targeted surveillance experiments calling for all potential testers using PCR in a defined area to start testing and report to a specific entity.
