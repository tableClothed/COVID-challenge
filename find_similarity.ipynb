      "0 Graphical Abstract Highlights d HA diversification arising during initial ferret adaption of avian flu virus is maintained d Low-frequency transmissible polymerase variants arise subsequently d Transmission bottleneck selects specific HA variants d Mammalian transmission can evolve through multiple genetic pathways SUMMARY Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a ''loose'' bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.\n",
      "1 The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23Â°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.\n",
      "2 While Table 4 provides estimates for assumed removal efficiencies for various MERV filters across the size ranges of concern for infectious droplet nuclei transmission, other important parameters for determining the impact of filtration on infectious disease risk in indoor environments include the infectious particle deposition rate and the recirculation rate through the HVAC system (which is a function of specific building characteristics).\n",
      "3 The influence that temperature and humidity have on aerosolized influenza virus and the consequence for transmission remain poorly understood despite the potential impact on the seasonality of influenza epidemics in the temperate regions of the world. Climatic conditions in tropical regions of the world represent a different set of parameters affecting transmission, and furthermore, routes of transmission not involving airborne virus (e.g. direct or indirect contact) demonstrate the complexity of global influenza virus transmission and the multitude of potential mechanisms at play each impacted differently by environmental conditions. Here, we Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets evaluated the transmissibility of two H3N2 influenza viruses (PN99 and IN11) using ferrets housed under diverse environmental conditions and concurrently evaluated the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. We compared the two virus groups to each other and then combined them to identify common differences at each environmental condition. Higher levels Environmental Conditions Affect Influenza Transmission in Ferrets of IN11 virus were measured in ferret nasal washes and in exhaled aerosol samples compared to PN99 virus but overall, we found little difference in the transmission capabilities of the two viruses at any of the environmental conditions with transmission most frequently observed at 23Â°C/30%RH (83%) and least frequently observed at 23Â°C/50%RH and 5Â°C/70%RH (17%).\n",
      "4 Understanding transmission of influenza and the factors that affect transmission is crucial for designing effective control strategies. Vaccination is by far the most common strategy to prevent flu infections. However, little is known on how vaccination affects transmission within pig populations. The objectives of this study were to quantify the spread of an H1N1 triple reassortant influenza virus in populations of pigs by calculating transmission parameters based on the outcome of transmission experiments, and to assess the effect of vaccine on susceptibility to influenza A virus infection in pigs vaccinated with either a homologous or a heterologous vaccine.\n"

    "## What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance? What has been published concerning systematic, holistic approach to diagnostics (from the public health surveillance perspective to being able to predict clinical outcomes)?\n",
    "- How widespread current exposure is to be able to make immediate policy recommendations on mitigation measures. Denominators for testing and a mechanism for rapidly sharing that information, including demographics, to the extent possible. Sampling methods to determine asymptomatic disease (e.g., use of serosurveys (such as convalescent samples) and early detection of disease (e.g., use of screening of neutralizing antibodies such as ELISAs).\n",
    "- Efforts to increase capacity on existing diagnostic platforms and tap into existing surveillance platforms.\n",
    "- Recruitment, support, and coordination of local expertise and capacity (public, privateâ€”commercial, and non-profit, including academic), including legal, ethical, communications, and operational issues.\n",
    "- National guidance and guidelines about best practices to states (e.g., how states might leverage universities and private laboratories for testing purposes, communications to public health officials and the public).\n",
    "- Development of a point-of-care test (like a rapid influenza test) and rapid bed-side tests, recognizing the tradeoffs between speed, accessibility, and accuracy.\n",
    "Rapid design and execution of targeted surveillance experiments calling for all potential testers using PCR in a defined area to start testing and report to a specific entity. These experiments could aid in collecting longitudinal samples, which are critical to understanding the impact of ad hoc local interventions (which also need to be recorded).\n",
    "- Separation of assay development issues from instruments, and the role of the private sector to help quickly migrate assays onto those devices.\n",
    "- Efforts to track the evolution of the virus (i.e., genetic drift or mutations) and avoid locking into specific reagents and surveillance/detection schemes.\n",
    "- Latency issues and when there is sufficient viral load to detect the pathogen, and understanding of what is needed in terms of biological and environmental sampling.\n",
    "- Use of diagnostics such as host response markers (e.g., cytokines) to detect early disease or predict severe disease progression, which would be important to understanding best clinical practice and efficacy of therapeutic interventions.\n",
    "- Policies and protocols for screening and testing.\n",
    "- Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.\n",
    "- Technology roadmap for diagnostics.\n",
    "- Barriers to developing and scaling up new diagnostic tests (e.g., market forces), how future coalition and accelerator models (e.g., Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) could provide critical funding for diagnostics, and opportunities for a streamlined regulatory environment.\n",
    "- New platforms and technology (e.g., CRISPR) to improve response times and employ more holistic approaches to COVID-19 and future diseases.\n",
    "- Coupling genomics and diagnostic testing on a large scale.\n",
    "- Enhance capabilities for rapid sequencing and bioinformatics to target regions of the genome that will allow specificity for a particular variant.\n",
    "Enhance capacity (people, technology, data) for sequencing with advanced analytics for unknown pathogens, and explore capabilities for distinguishing naturally-occurring pathogens from intentional.\n",
    "- One Health surveillance of humans and potential sources of future spillover or ongoing exposure for this organism and future pathogens, including both evolutionary hosts (e.g., bats) and transmission hosts (e.g., heavily trafficked and farmed wildlife and domestic food and companion species), inclusive of environmental, demographic, and occupational risk factors."
